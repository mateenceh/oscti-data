It is common to find articles, reports, and many people interested in quantum mechanics and the new capabilities and improvements it brings to the scientific community. This topic not only concerns physics, since the development of quantum mechanics impacts on several other fields such as chemistry, economics, artificial intelligence, operations research, and undoubtedly, cryptography.</p><p>This post begins a trio of blogs describing the impact of quantum computing on cryptography, and how to use stronger algorithms resistant to the power of quantum computing.</p><ul><li>This post introduces quantum computing and describes the main aspects of this new computing model and its devastating impact on security standards; it summarizes some approaches to securing information using quantum-resistant algorithms.</li><li>Due to the relevance of this matter, we present <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/towards-post-quantum-cryptography-in-tls">our experiments</a> on a large-scale deployment of quantum-resistant algorithms.</li><li>Our third <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-circl">post introduces CIRCL</a>, open-source Go library featuring optimized implementations of quantum-resistant algorithms and elliptic curve-based primitives.</li></ul><p>All of this is part of Cloudflare’s <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/welcome-to-crypto-week-2019/">Crypto Week 2019</a>, now fasten your seat-belt and get ready to make a quantum leap.</p><h3 id="what-is-quantum-computing">What is Quantum Computing?</h3><p>Back in 1981, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02650179">Richard Feynman</a> raised the question about what kind of computers can be used to simulate physics. Although some physical systems can be simulated in a classical computer, the amount of resources used by such a computer can grow exponentially. Then, he conjectured the existence of a computer model that behaves under quantum mechanics rules, which opened a field of research now called <em>quantum computing</em>. To understand the basics of quantum computing, it is necessary to recall how classical computers work, and from that shine a spotlight on the differences between these computational models.</p><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/06/pasted-image-0--2--1.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Fellows of the <a href="http://blogs.royalsociety.org/history-of-science/2012/07/24/art-of-finding-inspiration/">Royal Society</a>: John Maynard Smith, Richard Feynman &amp; Alan Turing</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>In 1936, Alan Turing and Emil Post independently described models that gave rise to the foundation of the computing model known as the Post-Turing machine, which describes how computers work and allowed further determination of limits for solving problems.</p><p>In this model, the units of information are <em>bits</em>, which store one of two possible values, usually denoted by 0 and 1. A computing machine contains a set of bits and performs operations that modify the values of the bits, also known as the machine’s state. Thus, a machine with <em>N</em> bits can be in one of <em>2</em>ᴺ possible states. With this in mind, the Post-Turing computing model can be abstractly described as a machine of states, in which running a program is translated as machine transitions along the set of states.</p><p>A <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspa.1985.0070">paper</a> David Deutsch published in 1985 describes a computing model that extends the capabilities of a Turing machine based on the theory of quantum mechanics. This computing model introduces several advantages over the Turing model for processing large volumes of information. It also presents unique properties that deviate from the way we understand classical computing. Most of these properties come from the nature of quantum mechanics. We’re going to dive into these details before approaching the concept of quantum computing.</p><h3 id="superposition">Superposition</h3><p>One of the most exciting properties of quantum computing that provides an advantage over the classical computing model is <em>superposition</em>. In physics, superposition is the ability to produce valid states from the addition or superposition of several other states that are part of a system.</p><p>Applying these concepts to computing information, it means that there is a system in which it is possible to generate a machine state that represents a (weighted) sum of the states 0 and 1; in this case, the term <em>weighted</em> means that the state can keep track of “the quantity of” 0 and 1 present in the state. In the classical computation model, one bit can only store either the state of 0 or 1, not both; even using two bits, they cannot represent the weighted sum of these states. Hence, to make a distinction from the basic states, quantum computing uses the concept of a <em>quantum bit</em> (<em>qubit</em>) -- a unit of information to denote the superposition of two states. This is a cornerstone concept of quantum computing as it provides a way of tracking more than a single state per unit of information, making it a powerful tool for processing information.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/06/switch-vs-dimmer@3x-1.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Classical computing – A bit stores only one of two possible states: ON or OFF.</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/06/switch-vs-dimmer@3x-copy.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Quantum computing – A qubit stores a combination of two or more states.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>So, a qubit represents the sum of two parts: the 0 or 1 state plus the amount each 0/1 state contributes to produce the state of the qubit.</p><p>In mathematical notation, qubit \( | \Psi \rangle \) is an explicit sum indicating that a qubit represents the superposition of the states 0 and 1. This is the Dirac notation used to describe the value of a qubit \( | \Psi \rangle =  A | 0 \rangle +B | 1 \rangle \), where, A and B are complex numbers known as the <em>amplitude</em> of the states 0 and 1, respectively. The value of the basic states is represented by qubits as \( | 0 \rangle =  1 | 0 \rangle + 0 | 1 \rangle \)  and \( | 1 \rangle =  0 | 0 \rangle + 1 | 1 \rangle \), respectively.

The result is a bit of information that depends on the state of the qubit. The bit, obtained by measuring \( | \Psi \rangle =  A | 0 \rangle +B | 1 \rangle \), will be equal to 0 with probability \( |A|^2 \),  and equal to 1 with probability \( |B|^2 \), where \( |x| \) represents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value#Complex_numbers">absolute value</a> of \(x\). </p><p>From Statistics, we know that the sum of probabilities of all possible events is always equal to 1, so it must hold that \( |A|^2 +|B|^2 =1 \).

Qubits are similar to the participants. When a qubit is in a superposition of states, it is tracking the probability of heads or tails, which is the participants’ uncertainty quotient while the coin is in the air. However, once you start to measure the qubit to retrieve its value, the superposition vanishes, and a classical bit value sticks: heads or tails. Measurement is that moment when the coin is static with only one side facing up.</p><p>A fair coin is a coin that is not biased. Each side (assume 0=heads and 1=tails) of a fair coin has the same probability of sticking after a measurement is performed. The qubit \( \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|0\rangle + \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|1\rangle \) describes the probabilities of tossing a fair coin.

The reversible version of a circuit could require the use of <em>ancillary</em> qubits as auxiliary (but not temporary) variables.</p><p>Due to the nature of composed systems, it could be possible that these <em>ancillas</em> (extra qubits) correlate to qubits of the main computation. This correlation makes it infeasible to reuse ancillas since any modification could have the side-effect on the operation of a reversible circuit.

Letting qubits interact with others leads to a <em>composed system</em> where more states are represented. The state of a 2-qubit composite system is denoted as \(A_0|00\rangle+A_1|01\rangle+A_2|10\rangle+A_3|11\rangle \), where, \( A_i \) values correspond to the amplitudes of the four basic states 00, 01, 10, and 11. This qubit \( \tfrac{1}{2}|00\rangle+\tfrac{1}{2}|01\rangle+\tfrac{1}{2}|10\rangle+\tfrac{1}{2}|11\rangle \) represents the superposition of these basic states, both having the same probability obtained after measuring the two qubits.</p><p>In the classical case, the state of N bits represents only <strong>one</strong> of 2ᴺ possible states, whereas a composed state of N qubits represents <strong>all</strong> the 2ᴺ states <em>but</em> in superposition.

The most important challenge is to guarantee low error rates during computation and measurement. Lowering these rates require techniques for error correction, which add a significant number of qubits specialized on this task. For this reason, the number of qubits of a quantum computer should not be regarded as for classical systems. In a classical computer, the bits of a computer are all effective for performing a calculation, whereas the number of qubits is the sum of the effective qubits (those used to make calculations) plus the ancillas (used for reversible computations) plus the error correction qubits.</p><p>Current implementations of quantum computers partially satisfy the DiVincenzo criteria.

The latter relies on finding a congruence of squares, that is, splitting \(N\) as a product of squares such that $$ N = x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)\times(x-y) $$ The complexity of NFS is mainly attached to the number of pairs \((x, y)\) that must be examined before getting a pair that factors \(N\). The NFS algorithm has subexponential complexity on the size of \(N\), meaning that the time required for splitting an integer increases significantly as the size of \(N\) grows. For large integers, the problem becomes intractable for classical computers. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="theaxeofthorshor">The Axe of <s>Thor</s> Shor</h3>

However, using a sharper axe allows you to split the log faster. This sharpened axe is the quantum algorithm proposed by Shor in 1994.</p><p>Let \(x\) be an integer less than \(N\) and of the order \(k\). Then, if \(k\) is even, there exists an integer \(q\) so \(qN\) can be factored as follows.</p><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GDU9PfKYGcI6l4uvKFH_wk_yZjX55rFpFFR0cLHr1ZCQmtkHlU8EO2K9VQWerbwwaIEdej8CLlJh9M3P1pCJWJ6SwGtRSIWoqNqll5enRkvvIv_nhj6uTWojWy0bc75-gt1VvfM7" class="kg-image"></figure><p></p><p>This approach has some issues. For example, the factorization could correspond to \(q\) not \(N\) and the order of \(x\) is unknown, and here is where Shor’s algorithm enters the picture, finding the order of \(x\).</p><p>The internals of Shor’s algorithm rely on encoding the order \(k\) into a periodic function, so that its period can be obtained using the quantum version of the Fourier transform (QFT). The order of \(x\) can be found using a polynomial number quantum evaluations of Shor’s algorithm. Therefore, splitting integers using this quantum approach has polynomial complexity on the size of \(N\).</p><p>Shor’s algorithm carries strong implications on the security of the RSA encryption scheme because its security relies on integer factorization. A large-enough quantum computer can efficiently break RSA for current instances.</p><p>Alternatively, one may recur to elliptic curves, used in cryptographic protocols like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/">ECDSA</a> or ECDH. Moreover, all <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/staying-on-top-of-tls-attacks/">TLS ciphersuites</a> use a combination of elliptic curve groups, large prime groups, and RSA and DSA signatures. Unfortunately, these algorithms all succumb to Shor’s algorithm. It only takes a few modifications for Shor’s algorithm to solve the discrete logarithm problem on finite groups. This sounds like a catastrophic story where all of our encrypted data and privacy are no longer secure with the advent of a quantum computer, and in some sense this is true.</p><p>On one hand, it is a fact that the quantum computers constructed as of 2019 are not large enough to run, for instance, Shor’s algorithm for the RSA key sizes used in standard protocols. For example, a 2018 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36058-z">report</a> shows experiments on the factorization of a 19-bit number using 94 qubits, they also estimate that 147456 qubits are needed for factoring a 768-bit number. Hence, there numbers indicates that we are still far from breaking RSA.</p><p>What if we increment RSA key sizes to be resistant to quantum algorithms, just like for symmetric algorithms? </p><p><a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers/pqrsa-20170419.pdf">Bernstein et al</a>. estimated that RSA public keys should be as large as 1 terabyte to maintain secure RSA even in the presence of quantum factoring algorithms. So, for public-key algorithms, increasing the size of keys does not help.</p><p>A recent investigation by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09749">Gidney and Ekerá</a> shows improvements that accelerate the evaluation of quantum factorization. In their report, the cost of factoring 2048-bit integers is estimated to take a few hours using a quantum machine of 20 million qubits, which is far from any current development. Something worth noting is that the number of qubits needed is two orders of magnitude smaller than the estimated numbers given in previous works developed in this decade. Under these estimates, current encryption algorithms will remain secure several more years; however, consider the following not-so-unrealistic situation.</p><p>Information currently encrypted with for example, RSA, can be easily decrypted with a quantum computer in the future. Now, suppose that someone records encrypted information and stores them until a quantum computer is able to decrypt ciphertexts. Although this could be as far as 20 years from now, the forward-secrecy principle is violated. A 20-year gap to the future is sometimes difficult to imagine. So, let’s think backwards, what would happen if all you did on the Internet at the end of the 1990s can be revealed 20 years later -- today. How does this impact the security of your personal information? What if the ciphertexts were company secrets or business deals? In 1999, most of us were concerned about the effects of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K problem</a>, now we’re facing Y2Q (<em>years to quantum</em>): the advent of quantum computers.</p><h3 id="post-quantum-cryptography">Post-Quantum Cryptography</h3><p>Although the current capacity of the physical implementation of quantum computers is far from a real threat to secure communications, a transition to use stronger problems to protect information has already started. This wave emerged as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography">post-quantum cryptography</a> (PQC). The core idea of PQC is finding algorithms difficult enough that no quantum (and classical) algorithm can solve them.</p><p>A recurrent question is: How does it look like a problem that even a quantum computer can not solve?</p><p>These so-called quantum-resistant algorithms rely on different hard mathematical assumptions; some of them as old as RSA, others more recently proposed. For example, McEliece cryptosystem, formulated in the late 70s, relies on the hardness of decoding a linear code (in the sense of coding theory). The practical use of this cryptosystem didn’t become widespread, since with the passing of time, other cryptosystems superseded in efficiency. Fortunately, McEliece cryptosystem <a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2011/68410758/68410758.pdf">remains immune</a> to Shor’s algorithm, gaining it relevance in the post-quantum era. </p><p>Post-quantum cryptography presents alternatives:</p><ol><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography">Lattice-based Cryptography</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_cryptography">Hash-based Cryptography</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersingular_isogeny_key_exchange">Isogeny-based Cryptography</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_code">Code-based Cryptography</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_cryptography">Multivariate-based Cryptography</a></li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/06/postq.png" class="kg-image"></figure><p>As of 2017, the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization">NIST</a> started an evaluation process that tracks possible alternatives for next-generation secure algorithms. From a practical perspective, all candidates present different trade-offs in implementation and usage. The time and space requirements are diverse; at this moment, it’s too early to define which will succeed RSA and elliptic curves. An initial round collected 70 algorithms for deploying key encapsulation mechanisms and digital signatures. As of early 2019, 28 of these survive and are currently in the analysis, investigation, and experimentation phase.</p><p>Cloudflare's mission is to help build a better Internet.
