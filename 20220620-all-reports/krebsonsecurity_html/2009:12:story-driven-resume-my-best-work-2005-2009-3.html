Below are links to what I believe is some of my best work over the past four years or so.

<h1><strong>Series: </strong>Cyber Gangs Fleece Small Businesses</h1>
<p><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/12/jmtest.html" target="_blank">Louisiana Firm Sues Capital One After Losing Thousands in Online Bank Fraud</a> <strong>Dec. 7, 2009</strong> &#8212; An electronics testing firm in Louisiana is suing its bank, Capital One, alleging that the financial institution was negligent when it failed to stop hackers from transferring nearly $100,000 out of its account earlier this year. In August, Security Fix wrote about<a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/08/businesses_reluctant_to_report.html"> </a>the plight of Baton Rouge-based JM Test Systems, an electronics testing firm that in February lost more than $97,000 from two separate unauthorized bank transfers a week apart.</p>
<p><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/12/who_says_pay-per-click_revenue.html" target="_blank">D.C. Businessman Loses Thousands After Clicking Wrong E-mail</a> <strong>Dec. 1, 2009</strong> &#8212; The latest victim to learn this was Nigel Parkinson, president of D.C.-based Parkinson Construction, a firm with an estimated $20 million in annual revenue that has worked on some of Washington&#8217;s top gathering places, including the new D.C. Convention Center and the<strong> </strong>Nationals baseball stadium.</p>
<p><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/11/hackers_hit_wash_dc_firm_for_1.html" target="_blank">Hackers Attempt to Take $1.3 Million from D.C Firm</a> <strong>Nov. 30, 2009</strong> &#8212; Most of the fraud against small businesses that I have been chronicling succeeded because the fraudsters were able to steal the victim&#8217;s online banking credentials and initiate a series of bogus payroll payments directly to so-called money mules, accomplices hired through work-at-home job schemes who are instructed to withdraw the money and wire it overseas (typically minus an eight percent commission). But according to this woman&#8217;s bank, the attackers set the unauthorized transfers in motion by using another company&#8217;s compromised account to initiate a &#8220;pull&#8221; or withdrawal from her company&#8217;s bank account. The crooks instructed nearly $1 million to be transferred from the D.C. firm to a company in West Virginia, and about $100,000 was sent to a company in Manteno, Ill. called Bill Anderson Painting.</p>
<p><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/11/business_e-banking_and_the_6-f.html" target="_blank">Business E-Banking and the 6-Figure Password</a> <strong>Nov. 4, 2009</strong> &#8212; On Monday, Security Fix featured the story of Ronnie Cutshall, a Tennessee man who was caught up in an international money laundering scam after being recruited through a work-at-home job offer. That story mentioned that Cutshall received a $9,600 transfer from a company called American Realty, but that I didn&#8217;t have any luck in tracking down the victim company. Today the American Realty company affected by that scam contacted me after reading my story (turns out they&#8217;re located in Shalimar, Fla., not Georgia, as I had previously thought).</p>

I find it strange that so few security companies are talking about what appears to be a clear demand for better back-end fraud detection technologies by many of the nation&#8217;s banks (more on this topic in a future column).</p>

The simplest, most cost-effective answer I know of? Don&#8217;t use Microsoft Windows when accessing your bank account online. <a href="https://www.krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/genlabs-thumb-198x261.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-11" title="genlabs-thumb-198x261" src="https://www.krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/genlabs-thumb-198x261-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

Now imagine your frustration when you go to log in to your PC to assess the damage, only to find that the computer you typically use to access the account has been kneecapped by the bad guys. This is precisely what happened to Kathy Dake, office manager for St. Isidore Catholic Church in Danville, Calif. Dake had infected her PC with the Zeus Trojan after opening a malicious e-mail disguised as notice from the IRS about &#8220;unreported income&#8221; (see New IRS Scam Could Be Costly).</p>

A week later, Silver Tail learned that Zeus had infiltrated its own network defenses.</p>
<p><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/09/irs_scam_e-mail_could_be_costl.html" target="_blank">New IRS Scam Could be Costly</a> <strong>Sept. 29, 2009</strong> &#8212; A recent victim of the scam is Landfill Service Corp., a solid waste company based in Apalachin, NY. Last week, the firm discovered that thieves had used Zeus to steal the company&#8217;s Internet banking credentials, after the attackers transferred $150,000 from its online bank account in a series of sub-$10,000 payments to 20 so-called money mules, co-conspirators around the country hired in job scams.</p>

The mule I spoke with said she was hired by a company called the Scope Group Inc., which claimed to be a nearly 20-year-old investment firm operating out of New York.</p>
<p><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/09/construction_firm_sues_bank_af.html" target="_blank">Maine Firm Sues Bank After $588,000 Cyber Heist</a> <strong>Sept. 23, 2009</strong> &#8212; A construction firm in Maine is suing a local bank after cyber thieves stole more than a half million dollars from the company in a sophisticated online bank heist.</p>

Downeast sent the notice after discovering that hackers had broken in and stolen more than $200,000 from the company&#8217;s online bank account.</p>
<p><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/09/cyber_mob_targets_public_priva.html" target="_blank">Cyber Crooks Target Public and Private Schools</a> <strong>Sept. 14, 2009</strong> &#8212; A gang of organized cyber criminals that has stolen millions from businesses across the United States over the past month appears to have turned its sights on public schools and universities. On the morning of Aug. 17, hackers who had broken into computers at the Sanford School District in tiny Sanford, Colorado initiated a batch of bogus transfers out of the school&#8217;s payroll account. Each of the transfers was kept just below $10,000 to avoid banks&#8217; anti-money laundering reporting requirements, and went out to at least 17 different accomplices or &#8220;money mules&#8221; that the attackers had hired via work-at-home job scams.</p>

At least, that&#8217;s the story told by two businesses which recently discovered Clampi infections, compromises that handed organized cyber gangs the access they needed to steal tens of thousands of dollars.

Today, I&#8217;d like to highlight the activities of Atrivo, a Concord, Calif., based network provider that hosts some of these services.Glbxdepeer-thumb-228&#215;203</p>

Since that time, Atrivo&#8217;s biggest network backbone provider decided it could no longer support the company, and stopped offering it direct connectivity.</p>

Atrivo, a.k.a &#8220;Intercage,&#8221; of Northern California, ceased to be reachable from any points on the Internet early Sunday morning when the ISP&#8217;s sole remaining provider &#8211; Pacific Internet Exchange (PIE) &#8211; stopped routing traffic for the troubled company.</p>

Happily, data released this week about a short-lived but precipitous decline in the level of badness online after Atrivo was shut down illustrates just how bad Atrivo was.</p>

Security experts say Storm&#8217;s death knell was sounded by the recent shutdown of Atrivo, a California based ISP that was home to a number of criminal cyber crime operations, including at least three of the master servers used to control the Storm network.</p>

Some of the most pervasive malicious software circulating today (e.g., Virut) includes spreading capabilities that hark back to the file-infecting methods of the earliest viruses, which spread by making copies of themselves, or by inserting their code into other files on the host system.</p>

Most security experts will tell you that while this so-called &#8220;nuclear option&#8221; is an available feature in some malware, it is hardly ever used. Disabling infected systems is counterproductive for attackers, who generally focus on hoovering as much personal and financial data as they can from the PCs they control. But try telling that to Roman Hüssy, a 21-year-old Swiss information technology expert, who last month witnessed a collection of more than 100,000 hacked Microsoft Windows systems tearing themselves apart at the command of their cyber criminal overlords.</p>

But I wonder whether authorities in those countries would be any more willing to pursue cyber crooks in their own countries if they were forced to confront just how deeply those groups have penetrated key government and private computer networks in those regions?</p>

At his behest, the commandeered PCs will begin downloading and installing software that will bombard their users with advertisements for pornographic Web sites. After the installation, 0x80 orders the machines to search the Internet for other potential victims.</p>

I don&#8217;t recall receiving as much feedback from readers after any other blog post, and many who wrote in wondered whether we were going to conduct the same analysis for other major software vendors.</p>

Agents from the Secret Service, operating in tandem with law enforcement officials in Canada, Brazil, Poland, Sweden and several other countries, had been investigating the ShadowCrew crime syndicate for months. The agents couldn&#8217;t risk giving the cybermobsters time to alert their comrades or delete incriminating data. The group&#8217;s Web site, shadowcrew.com, functioned as a sort of identity-theft eBay, a one-stop shop where criminals could buy and sell credit cards, Social Security numbers and mothers&#8217; maiden names like used car parts. Over two years, some 4000 ShadowCrew members had amassed two terabytes&#8217; worth of other people&#8217;s lives&#8211;18 million e-mail accounts and related personal data&#8211;mainly by tricking the victims themselves into giving up their information.</p>

I recently researched the past three years&#8217; worth of &#8220;critical&#8221; Microsoft patches &#8212; those that mend flaws that hackers can use to take control over Windows computers &#8212; and found that while that criticism may still be valid, Microsoft is making progress on a couple of key fronts.</p>

      <p>Brian, I fear I&#8217;m a little slow on the uptake &#8211; after failing to find your column on WaPo and thinking that you would return after the holidays, I finally realised that something was wrong and googled you thus discovering that I had missed your Security Fix posting of 24 December in which you announced your departure from the newspaper. So can it go ! Best of luck on your new venture &#8211; I see I shall have to revise my customary web-reading pattern !&#8230;</p>
