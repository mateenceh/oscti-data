				<p>I have written a great deal about how organized cyber gangs in Eastern Europe drained tens of millions of dollars from the bank accounts of small- to mid-sized businesses last year. But new evidence indicates one of the gangs chiefly responsible for these attacks managed to hack directly into a U.S. bank last year and siphon off tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>On July 30, 2009, at least five individuals across the United States each received an electronic transfer of funds for roughly $9,000, along with instructions to pull the cash out of their account and wire the funds in chunks of less than $3,000 via <strong>Western Union</strong> and <strong>Moneygram</strong> to three different individuals in Ukraine and Moldova.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/basicmule.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-350" title="basicmule" src="https://www.krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/basicmule-231x300.jpg" alt="" width="231" height="300" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/basicmule-231x300.jpg 231w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/basicmule.jpg 717w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /></a>The recipients had all been hired through work-at-home job offers via popular job search Web sites, and were told they would be acting as agents for an international finance company. The recruits were told that their job was to help their employers expedite money transfers for international customers that were &#8212; for some overly complicated reason or another &#8212; not otherwise able to move payments overseas in a timely enough manner.</p>
<p>The money was sent to these five U.S. recruits by an organized ring of computer thieves in Eastern Europe that specializes in hacking into business bank accounts. The attackers likely infiltrated the bank the same way they broke into the accounts of dozens of small businesses last year: By spamming out e-mails that spoofed a variety of trusted entities, from the IRS, to the Social Security Administration and UPS, urging recipients to download an attached password-stealing virus disguised as a tax form, benefits claim or a shipping label, for example. Recipients who opened the poisoned attachments infected their PCs, and the thieves struck gold whenever they managed to infect a PC belonging to someone with access to the company&#8217;s bank accounts online.</p>
<p><span id="more-201"></span></p>
<p>In each of those attacks, when the attackers found credentials for commercial bank accounts, they would log in to the victim&#8217;s account and set up bogus payroll payments to the newly-hired financial agents &#8212; known to the criminals and law enforcement alike as &#8220;money mules.&#8221; I&#8217;ve also interviewed dozens of these mules, and each one I spoke with said the deposits they received were all accompanied by e-mail messages stating the amount and time of the transfer, as well as the name of the &#8220;client&#8221; whose money their employers were supposedly &#8220;helping&#8221; to move.  <span class="pullquote">In every case, the name listed in the e-mail as the &#8220;client&#8221; was in fact a company that the thieves had looted</span> (see <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/09/money_mule_recruitment_101.html">Money Mule Recruitment Network Exposed</a> for another example of this).</p>
<p>On July 30, 2009, the thieves sent out at least five payments totaling nearly $50,000 to five separate money mules. In each case, the name of the client listed in the e-mail message the criminals sent to alert them of the transfer read &#8220;FIRST SENTRY BANK,&#8221; suggesting that the theft was the result of a computer compromise inside of First Sentry.</p>
<p>I attempted numerous times to get a response from someone at Huntington, West Virginia based First Sentry Bank about the July attack. I left no fewer than seven phone messages and sent several e-mails to bank employees, explaining who I was and the reason for my inquiry. To this day, I have yet to receive so much as a &#8220;no comment.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the money mules who helped move money out of First Sentry was a 65-year-old woman from Von Ormy, Texas, who spoke on condition of anonymity. She said she successfully withdrew the $9,099 sent to her from First Sentry, and wired it to three different individuals in Eastern Europe, as instructed. Four other money mules who also helped launder funds stolen from First Sentry said they also received similar amounts, and that their e-mailed receipts also listed First Sentry as the client. It is quite possible that the mules I spoke with represent a fraction of those who received funds in this attack: Some of the <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/small_business_victims/" target="_blank">more than two dozen victims of this crime</a> that I&#8217;ve chronicled lost upwards of $500,000.</p>
<p>The Von Ormy mule said she suspected the job may not have been legitimate, but decided she needed the money too badly to turn it down. She said she made about $500 off the transaction, after paying the fees to wire the money.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a senior citizen on a fixed income, and I hate to say it, but I did make some good money,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I knew it was too good to be true after making that doggone much money in one day, but it helped me out a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Below is the transaction message sent from the thieves to the Texas-based mule. Bobbear.co.uk, which does tireless work to track these scam Web sites, has a writeup <a href="http://www.bobbear.com/alliance-group-inc.html" target="_blank">here</a> on the site used to recruit the Von Ormy mule.</p>

      <p>I don&#8217;t know whether you&#8217;ve ever gotten a comment from them in the past, but shouldn&#8217;t Western Union be on the hook for at least a portion of this criminal activity?</p>
<p>Theft from the bank &#8211; which arguably should by now have all kinds of security measures in place regarding thyis rash of ongoing withdrawal abuse &#8211; is only the first half of the problem. Western Union and Moneygram are the actual crux of the crime being committed, and the criminals behind this know it.</p>
<p>Has anyone from Western Union ever made any comment regarding this continuing abuse?</p>

      <p>Walk away. If they send you money or a check, do nothing with it, except report it to your bank. In fact, might be a good idea to print out the emails you&#8217;ve received from them and go down to the bank and explain what happened. They should be able to help you close the account and open a new one.</p>

      <p>While I understand the Von Ormy mule needed the money, she still was wrong. And she readily knew that fact. Do these mules ever get prosecuted? For as many times that Brian has reported this story, it&#8217;s sad more people aren&#8217;t aware of the scam and that the banking industry hasn&#8217;t warned it customers against becoming mules. Until that happens it&#8217;s too much money for some to resist!</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m also curious about the legal repercussions of being a &#8220;money mule&#8221;.</p>
<p>While I realize that ultimately there&#8217;s no answer to this until someone hashes it out in court, does being provably ignorant of the fact that they&#8217;re helping move stolen money shield them from prosecution? Does being provably knowing of the fact that the &#8220;job&#8221; is not legitimate make them an accessory? What standard of proof would it take to make a mule an accessory to the theft?</p>

      <p>Generally serious crimes require as an element of the crime that the perpetrator knew what he was doing (in this case aiding in a theft).  These mules can argue that they thought it was a legitimate job, or just shut their mouths and not say anything and leave prosecutors with the difficult job of proving that the mule knew they were transferring stolen money.  By using lots of mules, and having each one handle relatively small amounts, they make it very unattractive for prosecutors to go after the mules.</p>
<p>If the banking industry did a media campaign along the lines of &#8220;work at home jobs involving money showing up in your account that you have to send somewhere else are criminal scams&#8221; then prosecutors would have an easier job (and fewer people would sign up for them).</p>

      <p>Expect this to continue as long as the registrars are complicit in this activity. An exploit on HSBC is currently in progress. It downloads a bot, certificate.exe, after gathering your bank credentials. The domain used for this exploit was registered with domainpeople.com. The registrar was notified by a researcher and given samples of the exploit more than 24 hours ago. No response. The exploit continues. The solution by most domain resellers is to no longer supply registrant information so their negligence in registering fraudulent domains is not seen.</p>

      <p>@TheGeezer &#8211; Your complaint is valid about phishing/malware domains allowed to remain alive for hours or days, especially those hosted on botnets, where there is no single hosting service that can shut down the website if the registrar fails to act.  I looked at domainpeople&#8217;s registration agreement and have some ideas, but it&#8217;s off topic here. You may wish to become a member at inboxrevenge.com and start a thread there if you are having trouble getting a particular domain shut down.</p>

      <p>The more I read about these money mules, the less I think they are free from culpability. There are enough red flags to make anyone realize that these are dodgy transactions, and yet they engage in them anyway. The woman quoted in the article said she had her &#8220;I knew it was too good to be true&#8221; moment after collecting her loot, but it&#8217;s hard to believe she didn&#8217;t have this realization much earlier in the process.</p>

      <p>The mules have plausible deniability.  There is also the matter of intent, and it would be extremely difficult to prove criminal intent on the part of these people.  Toss in the fact that the amounts are not large, whether it&#8217;s the money moved or the mule fee, and you are spending more money in the court and prison system than the impact on society.<br />
Since it&#8217;s tough to determine intent, you can&#8217;t distinguish a true criminal from a person looking for a few bucks.  With the ever increasing gap in the distribution of wealth, we will see more folks acting as mules in the future.  But the solution is not to imprison all mules, that just won&#8217;t make sense and will be too costly.  We need law enforcement, the banking industry, ISP&#8217;s, etc. to work together against the real perpetrators of this activity &#8211; the groups behind it.</p>

      <p>This is correct, I think. Put yourself in the shoes of a local prosecutor who has to convince a jury of the defendant&#8217;s peers, most of whom probably aren&#8217;t much brighter than these mules, that the mule knew what they were getting into. That&#8217;s probably a non-starter for even ambitious, junior prosecutors.</p>
<p>That said, what these mules are doing is probably not dissimilar legally from people who pass bad checks or cash fraudulent checks. Ignorance of the law is not a legal defense, but sadly it is often a sufficient one.</p>

      <p>Ignorance of the law is never a defense.  What is a defense, for many crimes, is ignorance of the true nature of the act the perpetrator is committing.  For example, if you are hired to sit in a booth an push a red button when a buzzer goes off, and it turns out that the button fires a gun that kills someone, then you are not guilty of murder because you had no idea you were firing a gun.  However, there are a number of crimes that by their definition do not require proof of knowledge of the act.  Most traffic laws do not require knowledge of the act; so not knowing you were speeding is no defense.  I imagine (but don&#8217;t know) that some of the bad check laws are written this way too.  All this to say, in order to make money mules liable without proving knowledge of the act they were committing (transferring stolen money) you would have to have new laws passed making it a crime to transfer stolen money even if the perpetrator didn&#8217;t know the money was stolen.</p>

      <p>@AndyfromTucson:  Quote: &#8220;Most traffic laws do not require knowledge of the act; so not knowing you were speeding is no defense.&#8221;  Traffic laws require the driver to know the speed at which the vehicle they are driving is moving, at all times, and to always know the speed limit for the span of the road on which they are currently driving.  So, if you didn&#8217;t know that the vehicle was exceeding the speed limit, then you have broken the first law, and if you didn&#8217;t know the speed limit, then you have broken the second law, and if you did know both the limit and the fact that the vehicle was moving above the limit, then you&#8217;ve broken another law instead.  You might avoid a fine and get a &#8220;fix it&#8221; ticket instead if you can convince the officer (or the judge) that the speedometer is dysfunctional or not operating, but that is not likely, IMHO.</p>

      <p>Brian, </p>
<p>Congratulations on your new venture, and I look forward to your continuing excellent work. </p>
<p>Apparently our cyber paths continue to cross in the cesspools of organized cybercrime. As an avid reader of your outstanding series on &#8220;Cyber Gangs Fleece Small Businesses&#8221;. I can&#8217;t help but note some of the similarities between the Clampi / Zeus / Zbot bank looting operations, and that of the multi million dollar annual card fraud laundering operation which has operated within the global financial system unfettered for over half a decade. </p>
<p>The published reports of the actual cash transfer drop instructions given to these mules, is what highlighted some of the similarities. In both cases, I believe that the named Western Union drops are also picked up by mules at the other end, and that it is one of several steps in the laundering process. It is my opinion that there is an organized Eastern European crminal version of a sort of &#8220;Hawala&#8221;, which specifically services cyber criminals and their ongoing global crimes, is untracable, and utilizes Western Union and Money Gram.</p>
<p>If you look at some of the published reports given to the mules in the small business bank account fleecing, such as:</p>
<p>================================================<br />
Dear (MY NAME), </p>

<p>Chisinau, Moldova repeatedly shows up as the origination point of hundreds of spam forum posts which were used to seed search engines by the organized crime syndicate card fraud laundering operation. The posts were used to create references and ranking for the fake business names used on Careerbuilder.com for recruiting cyber mules. Over 150 job adds for cyber mules were placed on Careerbuilder for the fake recruiting company Skydexsoft.com. (Warning: Skydex Soft was infected with iframe malware exploits). That was preceeded by numerous forum posts from supposed customers praising the company. Those postings originated from Chisnau Moldova, IP Address: 91.214.201.92 static-91-214-201-92.roxnet.md, and also from starnet.md in Chisinau. Those IPs were also the source of several hundreds of forum posts which used various card fraud laundering domain names with telephone numbers as their forum aliases. <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r19620593-Ebook-websites-fraud-charges-DevbillDigitalAgePluto?hifilter=Moldova" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r19620593-Ebook-websites-fraud-charges-DevbillDigitalAgePluto?hifilter=Moldova</a> The purpose of the latter was to demote search engine rankings of subsequent victim card fraud reports from the various fraud websites.</p>
<p>In one of your &#8220;Cyber Gangs Fleece Small Businesses&#8221; reports, you listed these mule instructions:</p>

<p>For three years the Ukraine has been the originating point of several similar Western Union transfers, which were sent to the US to cover the US Bank fees, Authorize.net merchant account setup fees, and LLC registration costs, for the card fraud laundering website facilities.   </p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to wish you a merry Christmas! </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get back to work now. I got a confirmation that the amount of money needed for the company registration was sent to you about an hour ago. You can get it via Western Union. Below you can find all the information you will need to receive this transfer : </p>
<p>SENDER : grigoriy gorvat<br />
CITY, COUNTRY : Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine<br />
MTCN : 41263XXXXX<br />
AMOUNT : $XXX</p>
<p>SENDER : vadim zagray<br />
CITY, COUNTRY : Kyiv, Ukraine<br />
MTCN : 19610XXXXX<br />
AMOUNT : $XXX</p>
<p>After receiving the Western Union transfer please send me an e-mail message to confirm the fact that you are in possession of the amount of money needed and you have started the company registration process. After that please read the following step-by-step instructions to set up your work. </p>
<p>o    Recommendations for company legalization via LegalZoom.com<br />
1.    It is highly recommended that the company name would include the word Solutions, Technologies and Design.<br />
2.    If it is required to indicate the scope of activity of the company, please indicate software sales / website development<br />
3.    Get a Tax ID*</p>
<p>*   There are two ways of getting a Tax ID</p>
<p>a.    You can find a special form in your Express Gold package, that will be delivered to you along with your new company documents. After filling out  this form and sending it to IRS, you will get your Tax ID for free in two weeks. </p>
<p>b.    LegalZoom.com gives you an opportunity to get a Tax ID while you are registering your company. You are going to need extra $49 to do so.</p>
<p>&#8230;.<br />

..                    </p>
<p>The moment when you sign the contract will be the start of your first working day.</p>

<p>Circa January 2008 another duped cyber-mule who was recruited by fellowsolutions.com, and was subsequently assigned a card fraud laundering website of IPD-TECHNOLOGIES.COM, was sent funds to cover the LLC, business bank account, and Authorize.net set up fees:</p>

=====================================</p>
<p>Just a few months ago, in an unexpected turn of events, the Ukraine once again showed up as the source of a $2,000 Western Union in bound transfer to the US, to support the organized crime syndicate&#8217;s card fraud laundering operation. In this case the unwitting cyber-mule who had set up an LLC and three FBNs to support three of the crime syndicate&#8217;s card fraud laundering websites, was tracked down and finally reached after about two months in operation. By that time the syndicate had processed around $100,000 in fraudulent charges to hijacked card data. At the time of initial contact the mule reported having made foreign wire transfers of some of the fraud proceeds a day earlier. After instructing the mule to lock out the authorize.net account and place it in test mode, they were then instructed to contact the bank the following morning and to try and revoke wire transfers made in the previous day or two. Around $80,000 of the fraud proceeds had already been sent out of the country.</p>
<p>In this case the inbound Western Union cash from the Ukraine was a surprise ending to a ruse which was created to stall the cyber criminals, while attempts were made to freeze the foreign bank account where the card fraud proceeds were going to. Though it is typical for the fraud proceeds to be withdrawn in cash upon receipt at the foreign bank accounts, numerous fraud entities would have been wiring funds there, so there may have been a chance to freeze fresh wires. Unfortunately the process of revocation was handled as a typical recall and not as a fraud event, so the criminals were alerted to the attempted revocation. In order to deflect the criminals attention, a ruse was created to explain what they were seeing from their end, and the Western Union surprise was the unexpected result. That scenario can best be seen from these edited communication transcripts:</p>
<p>After first phone call:</p>
<p>==========================<br />
Subject: Follow up to telephone conversation</p>
<p>Please forward me copies of the emails that worldcreativestudio.com<br />
sent you which contain instructions to wire the money.<br />
==========================<br />
==========================</p>
<p>Hi MGD,</p>
<p>Needless to say, I am speechless and in a complete state of shock. I went<br />
ahead and placed all 3 accounts on test mode and changed all the passwords.<br />
These people do not have access to the bank accounts. How long would you say<br />
it takes for the sales to stop going through once the accounts are in test<br />
mode?</p>
<p>==========================<br />
==========================<br />
Hi,</p>
<p>As soon as you place it in test mode then no more charges will be processed.<br />
The criminals may be still processing charges into the system, as it will<br />
take them a while to realize that the system once set to test mode will<br />
accept the entries, however, it will discard and not process them. For<br />
ethical and other reasons, you can now no longer contest the disputed<br />
charges from the card victims. Depending on the available current funds in<br />
the account it is best to issue credits to as many of the current pending<br />
disputes as possible.</p>
<p>Also, I need the wiring details ASAP, so I can try and have the Latvian bank<br />
account frozen. Based on the limited information that you gave me over the<br />
phone regarding the beneficiary name of &#8220;DIMEFIELD MANAGEMENT LTD.&#8221; in the<br />
British Virgin Islands, I have came up with this as a possible address:</p>
<p>PO Box 3469,<br />
Geneva Place,<br />
Waterfront Drive,<br />
Road Town,<br />
Tortola,<br />
British Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>The BVI is a known haven of offshore shell company registrations for Russian and<br />
other money laundering criminals.<br />

<p>From Cyber-Mule:</p>
<p>13 transfers totaling $87,592. I did the math earlier. Are you already in<br />

<p>Thanks for your help&#8230;<br />
==========================<br />

To Cyber-Mule:</p>
<p>Go to Wachovia ASAP and try and initiate a revocation on the last wire<br />
transfers that just left. Foreign transfers take a few days, and they may be<br />
able to recall it if it has not reached the account at the Latvian bank<br />

<p>The Cyber criminals are now aware of the Wachovia bank request to Aizkraukles Banka<br />
for the return of the funds. Normal procedures require that the recipient sign off and<br />
authorize the return of wires. Obviously even if the funds were still there that is not going to happen. In order to stall for time and for other events to take place the cyber mule initially responded to the crime syndicate&#8217;s inquiry on the authorize.net merchant processing account lockout as may being related to excessive chargebacks, and said they would find out what was going on.</p>

<p>Will we be able to start to sell on September 1st? Then we would limit<br />
our sales up to $40,000 for each account. And there will be always<br />
enough funds to cover all chargebacks. Or will we not be able to start to sell again?</p>

pay our other services already.</p>

To: cyber-mule </p>
<p>Excellent, got it.</p>
<p>I see they are asking about if they will be able to continue billing. I<br />
suggest you tell them this:</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;<br />
&#8220;Due to the growing number of charge backs the merchant account underwriter<br />
told me that they require me to give them an additional $2,000 to be held in<br />
reserve to cover any pending charge backs and the associated fees. This<br />
reserve is above and beyond any pending or actual receipts. They require<br />
this reserve to be on deposit before they will allow the accounts to be<br />
released for additional card processing. Since that $2,000 is above and<br />
beyond the funds that are in the bank account, I am not willing to fund this<br />
out of my pocket.</p>
<p>If you wish to continue processing sales then you need to wire this $2,000<br />
back to business bank account, or send it in some form. That is why I tried<br />
to recall the last transfer in order to cover this new requirement&#8221;. If you<br />
do not wish to cover this reserve requirement I will be unable to have the<br />
processing account released. The underwriter at Transfirst said that they<br />
are experiencing an increased amount of chargebacks in general from<br />
ecommerce, and are increasing the reserve requirements on certain designated<br />
accounts to protect themselves.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>They may be too smart and knowledgeable to believe this, however, it is<br />
close enough to reality that they may go for it. Especially if they think<br />
that they will be able to continue processing fraud charges. The amount is<br />
small enough that they might consider it worth the risk.<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Why can they no take this reserve from the hold funds on third<br />
website? They hold aprox. $7,000. So they can take all these money for<br />
all 3 websites for reserve.<br />
Or we can sell for each website for $2,000 and they take these funds<br />
for the reserve.</p>
<p>What you sent to us we spent all funds for advertising.</p>

<p>To Cyber-Mule:</p>
<p>LOL !!  &#8220;We spent it on advertising&#8221; the lying scum. That is right up there<br />
with &#8220;the dog ate my homework&#8221;</p>
<p>How ironic, not only do the criminals not spend even a penny advertising the sites,<br />
they block every one of the hundreds of them from even being found by search<br />
engines.</p>
<p>Take your time in answering, but we will put the ball back in their court by<br />
saying</p>
<p>&#8220;They told me that the $2,000 is the balance needed to meet the total<br />
required reserve. As I told you, I do not have that additional money, nor<br />
should I have to use my personal money to support the business. The merchant<br />
account underwriter&#8217;s risk department said that those additional funds will<br />
have to be on deposit before they will release the accounts for further<br />
processing. So it will be impossible to generate that balance from<br />
additional sales. Let me know what you wish to do, as I will need to look<br />
for other employment quickly if you are not going to continue the business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though over the years the millions in fraud proceeds have gone from various US banks to assorted foreign banks, inbound support funds have primarily come via Western Union from the Ukraine. More recently they have also used Russian PayPal accounts for set up costs. The connections at this stage between the two fraud operations may be anecdotal. You have reported that several of the lootings from business accounts were made via direct transfers to foreign bank accounts. Though none of those details have been published so far, It would be interesting to see if they have anything in common with the other multi year ongoing fraud operation. Organized cyber crime is way ahead of any efforts by the finanical system to impede their operations. As for Western Union and Money Gram, they are the holy grail of fraudulent money laundering. If cash transfers via those systems were halted for a week, it would have the same effect on cyber crime as the combined results of pulling the plug on Atrivo, McColo, and 3FN / Pricewert.</p>
