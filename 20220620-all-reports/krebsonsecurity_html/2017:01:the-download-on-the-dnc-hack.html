			<h2 class="post-title">The Download on the DNC Hack</h2>

			<div class="entry">
 				 
				<p>Over the past few days, several longtime readers have asked why I haven&#8217;t written about two stories that have consumed the news media of late: The alleged Russian hacking attacks against the U.S. <strong>Democratic National Committee</strong> (DNC) and, more recently, the discovery of malware on a laptop at a Vermont power utility that has been attributed to Russian hacker groups.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve avoided covering these stories mainly because I don&#8217;t have any original reporting to add to them, and because I generally avoid chasing the story of the day &#8212; preferring instead to focus on producing original journalism on cybercrime and computer security.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-37473" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dnc-580x355.png" alt="dnc" width="580" height="355" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dnc-580x355.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dnc-768x470.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dnc.png 922w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" />But there is another reason for my reticence: Both of these stories are so politically fraught that to write about them means signing up for gobs of vitriolic hate mail from readers who assume I have some political axe to grind no matter what I publish on the matter.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/something-about-this-russia-story-stinks-w458439" target="_blank">An article</a> in <em>Rolling Stone</em> over the weekend aptly captures my unease with reporting on both of these stories in the absence of new, useful information (the following quote refers specifically to the Obama administration&#8217;s sanctions against Russia related to the DNC incident).</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem with this story is that, like the Iraq-WMD mess, it takes place in the middle of a highly politicized environment during which the motives of all the relevant actors are suspect,&#8221; Rolling Stone political reporter <strong>Matt Taibbi</strong> wrote. &#8220;Absent independent verification, reporters will have to rely upon the secret assessments of intelligence agencies to cover the story at all. Many reporters I know are quietly freaking out about having to go through that again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alas, one can only nurse a New Year&#8217;s holiday vacation for so long. Here are some of the things I&#8217;ve been ruminating about over the past few days regarding each of these topics. Please be kind.</p>
<p>Gaining sufficient public support for a conclusion that other countries are responsible for hacking important U.S. assets can be difficult &#8211; even when the alleged aggressor is already despised and denounced by the entire civilized world.</p>
<p>The remarkable hacking of <strong>Sony Pictures Entertainment</strong> in late 2014 and the Obama administration&#8217;s quick fingering of hackers in North Korea as the culprits is a prime example: When the Obama administration released its findings that North Korean hackers were responsible for breaking into SPE, few security experts I spoke to about the incident were convinced by the intelligence data coming from the White House.</p>
<p>That seemed to change somewhat following the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/19/world/asia/nsa-tapped-into-north-korean-networks-before-sony-attack-officials-say.html?_r=0" target="_blank">leak of a National Security Agency document</a> which suggested the United States had planted malware capable of tracking the inner workings of the computers and networks used by the North&#8217;s hackers. Nevertheless, I&#8217;d wager that if we took a scientific poll among computer security experts today, a fair percentage of them probably still strongly doubt the administration&#8217;s conclusions.</p>
<p>If you were to ask those doubting experts to explain why they persist in their unbelief, my guess is you would find these folks break down largely into two camps: Those who believe the administration will never release any <em>really detailed</em> (and likely classified) information needed to draw a more definitive conclusion, and those who because of their political leanings tend to disbelieve virtually everything that comes out of the current administration.</p>
<p>Now, the American public is being asked to accept the White House&#8217;s technical assessment of another international hacking incident, only this time the apparent intention of said hacking is nothing less than to influence the outcome of a historically divisive presidential election in which the sitting party lost.</p>
<p>It probably doesn&#8217;t matter how many indicators of compromise and digital fingerprints the Obama administration releases on this incident: Chances are decent that if you asked a panel of security experts a year from now whether the march of time and additional data points released or leaked in the interim have influenced their opinion, you&#8217;ll find them just as evenly divided as they are today.</p>
<p>The mixed messages coming from the camp of President-elect Trump haven&#8217;t added any clarity to the matter, either. Trump has publicly mocked American intelligence assessments that Russia meddled with the U.S. election on his behalf, and said recently that he doubts the U.S. government can be certain it was hackers backed by the Russian government who hacked and leaked emails from the DNC.</p>
<p>However, one of Trump&#8217;s top advisers &#8212; former <strong>CIA Director</strong> <strong>James Woolsey</strong> &#8212; <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/02/politics/digital-fingerprints-russia-hacking/" target="_blank">now says</a> he believes the Russians (and possibly others) <em>were</em> in fact involved in the DNC hack.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the U.S. government has offered some additional perspective on why it is so confident in its conclusion that Russian military intelligence services were involved in the DNC hack. A <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/12/29/fact-sheet-actions-response-russian-malicious-cyber-activity-and" target="_blank">White House fact sheet</a> published alongside the <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf" target="_blank">FBI/DHS Joint Analysis Report</a> (PDF) says the report &#8220;includes information on computers around the world that Russian intelligence services have co-opted without the knowledge of their owners in order conduct their malicious activity in a way that makes it difficult to trace back to Russia. In some cases, the cybersecurity community was aware of this infrastructure, in other cases, this information is newly declassified by the U.S. government.&#8221;<span id="more-37410"></span></p>
<h4>BREADCRUMBS</h4>
<p>As I said in <a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/814574626768568320" target="_blank">a tweet a few days back</a>, the only remarkable thing about the hacking of the DNC is that the people responsible for protecting those systems somehow didn&#8217;t expect to be constantly targeted with email-based malware attacks. Lest anyone think perhaps the Republicans were better at anticipating such attacks, the FBI <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-illinois-republican-party-email-hack-met-1212-20161211-story.html" target="_blank">notified the Illinois Republican Party</a> in June 2016 that some of its email accounts may have been hacked by the same group. The New York Times has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/10/us/politics/trump-mocking-claim-that-russia-hacked-election-at-odds-with-gop.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that Russian hackers also broke into the DNC&#8217;s GOP counterpart &#8212; the <strong>Republican National Committee</strong> &#8212; but chose to release documents only on the Democrats.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say for certain if the Russian government was involved in directing or at least supporting attacks on U.S. political parties. But it seems to me they would be foolish not to have at least tried to get their least-hated candidate elected given how apparently easy it was to break in to the headquarters of both parties. Based on what I&#8217;ve learned over the past decade studying Russian language, culture and hacking communities, my sense is that if the Russians were responsible and wanted to hide that fact &#8212; they&#8217;d have left a trail leading back to some other country&#8217;s door.</p>
<p>That so many Russian hackers simply don&#8217;t bother to cover their tracks when attacking and plundering U.S. targets is a conclusion that many readers of this blog have challenged time and again, particularly with stories in my <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/breadcrumbs/" target="_blank">Breadcrumbs series</a>. It&#8217;s too convenient and pat to be true, these detractors frequently claim. In my experience, however, if Russian hackers profiled on this blog were exposed because they did a poor job hiding their tracks, it&#8217;s usually because they didn&#8217;t even try.</p>
<p>In my view, this has more to do with the reality that there is very little chance these hackers will ever be held accountable for their crimes as long as they remain in Russia (or at least in former Soviet states that remain loyal to Russia). Take the case of <strong>Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev</strong>, one of the hackers named in the U.S. government&#8217;s assessment of those responsible for the DNC attack.</p>
<div id="attachment_34554" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34554" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-34554" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bogachev-1-580x297.png" alt="Bogachev, the alleged Zeus Trojan author, in undated photos." width="580" height="297" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bogachev-1-580x297.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bogachev-1.png 669w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-34554" class="wp-caption-text">Bogachev, the alleged Zeus Trojan author, in undated photos.</p></div>
<p>A Russian hacker better known by his hacker alias &#8220;Slavik&#8221; and as the author of the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/zeus-trojan/" target="_blank">ZeuS Trojan</a> malware, Bogachev landed on the FBI&#8217;s 10-most-wanted list in 2014. The cybercriminal organization Bogchev allegedly ran was responsible for the theft of more than $100 million from banks and businesses worldwide that were infected with his ZeuS malware. That organization, dubbed the &#8220;Business Club,&#8221; had members spanning most of Russia&#8217;s 11 time zones.</p>
<p><strong>Fox-IT</strong>, a Dutch security firm that infiltrated the Business Club&#8217;s back-end operations, said that beginning in late fall 2013 — about the time that conflict between Ukraine and Russia was just beginning to heat up — Slavik retooled his cyberheist botnet to serve as purely a spying machine, and began scouring infected systems in Ukraine for specific keywords in emails and documents that would likely only be found in classified documents.</p>
<p>Likewise, the keyword searches that Slavik used to scour bot-infected systems in Turkey suggested the botmaster was searching for specific files from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Turkish KOM – a specialized police unit. Fox-IT said it was clear that Slavik was looking to intercept communications about the conflict in Syria on Turkey’s southern border — one that Russia has supported by reportedly shipping arms into the region.</p>
<p>To date, Bogachev appears to be a free man, despite <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/fbi-3m-bounty-for-zeus-trojan-author/" target="_blank">a $3 million bounty</a> placed on his head by the FBI. This is likely because he&#8217;s remained inside Russia or at least within its sphere of protective influence. According to the FBI, Bogachev is known to enjoy boating and may be hiding out on a vessel somewhere in the Black Sea.</p>
<h4>AN &#8216;INFRASTRUCTURE NEXUS&#8217;</h4>
<p>For the relatively few Russian hackers who do wind up in Russian prisons as a result of their cybercriminal activity, agreeing to hack another government might be the easiest way to get out of jail. The<em> New York Times</em> carried <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/world/europe/how-russia-recruited-elite-hackers-for-its-cyberwar.html" target="_blank">a story</a> last month about how how Russian hackers like Bogachev often get recruited or coerced by the Russian government to work on foreign intelligence-gathering operations.</p>
<p>The story noted that while &#8220;much about Russia’s cyberwarfare program is shrouded in secrecy, details of the government’s effort to recruit programmers in recent years — whether professionals like&#8230;college students, or even criminals — are shedding some light on the Kremlin’s plan to create elite teams of computer hackers.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Times reporter <strong>Andrew Kramer</strong>, a convicted hacker named <strong>Dmitry A. Artimovich</strong> was approached by Russian intelligence services while awaiting trial for building malware that was used in crippling online attacks. Artimovich told Kramer that in prison while awaiting trial he was approached by a cellmate who told Artimovich he could get out of jail if he agreed to work for the government.</p>
<p>Artimovich said he declined the offer. He was convicted of hacking and later spent a year in a Russian penal colony for his crimes. Artimovich also was a central figure in my book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spam-Nation-Organized-Cybercrime-Epidemic/dp/1492603236" target="_blank">Spam Nation: The Inside Story of Organized Cybercrime, from Global Epidemic to Your Front Door</a></em>. His exploits, and that of his brother Igor, are partially detailed in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=artimovich&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">various posts on this blog</a>, but the long and the short of them is that Artimovich created a botnet that was used mainly for spam.</p>
<p>That is, until a friend of his hired him to launch a cyberattack against a company that provided payment processing services to Aeroflot, an airline that is 51 percent owned by the Russian government.</p>
<p>For many years, Artimovich used his botnet, dubbed &#8220;Festi&#8221; by security researchers, to pump spam promoting male enhancement drugs for a rogue online pharmacy operations called <strong>Rx-Promotion</strong>. <strong>Pavel Vrublevsky, </strong>RX-Promotion&#8217;s founder and the man who hired Artimovich to launch the cyberattack &#8212; also was convicted in the same trial, and sentenced to two years in a penal colony. However, Vrublevsky was inexplicably released after less than a year in Russia&#8217;s hinterlands.</p>
<p>Vrublevsky&#8217;s company <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/chronopay/" target="_blank">ChronoPay</a> was indirectly featured in another <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/world/europe/russia-hacker-vladimir-fomenko-king-servers.html" target="_blank">story</a> about the hacking of the DNC. In September, The Times profiled <strong>Vladimir M. Fomenko</strong>, the 26-year-old manager of the web hosting firm <strong>King Servers</strong>, which was “used by hackers in an incursion on computerized election systems in Arizona and Illinois.&#8221; U.S. cybersecurity firm <strong>ThreatConnect</strong> identified the <a href="https://threatconnect.com/blog/state-board-election-rabbit-hole/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://threatconnect.com/blog/state-board-election-rabbit-hole/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1483817063079000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGrcQzTqripMwXkZkjeRV7GDuzuVw">infrastructure nexus</a> between those attacks and cyberattacks on democratic processes in several countries, including Germany, Turkey and Ukraine.  [Full disclosure: ThreatConnect has been an advertiser on this blog.]</p>

<p>To bring this full circle, on Sept. 15, 2016, Fomenko issued a statement about the ThreatConnect report. That statement, originally written in Russian, was translated from Russian into English by Vrublevsky, and <a href="https://chronopay.com/blog/2016/09/15/chronopay-pomogaet-king-servers-com/" target="_blank">reposted on ChronoPay&#8217;s Web site</a>.</p>
<p>“The analysis of the internal data allows King Servers to confidently refute any conclusions about the involvement of the Russian special services in this attack,” Fomenko said in his statement, which credits ChronoPay for the translation. &#8220;The company also reported that the attackers still owe the company $US290 for rental services and King Servers send an invoice for the payment to Donald Trump &amp; Vladimir Putin, as well as the company reserves the right to send it to any other person who will be accused by mass media of this attack.&#8221;</p>
<h4>FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE BOTNETS</h4>
<p>If indeed those who hacked the DNC were recruited from the ranks of the cybercriminal community focused mainly on financial crime, I would not be surprised in the least. The Russian source who first introduced me to much of the cyber underground told me exactly this when we first met some years ago. He had just left the Russian military for a job at a computer security firm in Russia, and his job was to build a presence on all of the Russian-language cybercrime forums and learn the real-life identities of the major power players in that space.</p>
<p>That source, who won&#8217;t be named here because it would compromise his current position and create legal problems for him, said he routinely saw Russian intelligence services recruiting hackers on cybercrime forums &#8212; particularly for research into potential vulnerabilities in the software and hardware that powers various national power grids and other energy infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;All these guys had interest in hacking government resources, including Russian [targets],&#8221; my source told me. &#8220;Several years ago I got to know one of these hackers who worked for Russian government, [and] he operated his [cybercrime] forum as a government honeypot for hiring hackers. They were hiring hackers to work in official government organizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, he said, the hackers targeted U.S. military installations and U.S. news media outlets, but eventually they turned their attention to collecting government and corporate secrets full-time. The source said the teams routinely used botnets for foreign intelligence gathering and counterintelligence, and frequently sought to infiltrate botnets that were suspected of being co-opted for the same purposes by other countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they started attacking foreign-only targets, and even started their own VPN (virtual private networking) service for English-speaking customers so they could capture corporate data,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;They also ran a service for checking stolen PDFs and other documents for [proprietary] data and classified information. If something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet" target="_blank">Stuxnet</a> destroys some power plant, I will think about these guys first. Now I use them as a source of information about foreign intelligence botnets, so I really don&#8217;t want them to be uncovered.&#8221;</p>
<h4>ARE WE NOT ENTERTAINED?</h4>
<p>Perhaps it shouldn&#8217;t be surprising if many people remain unconvinced by the Joint Analysis Report released by the Obama administration. Fresh from an especially rancorous election muddled by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/russian-propaganda-effort-helped-spread-fake-news-during-election-experts-say/2016/11/24/793903b6-8a40-4ca9-b712-716af66098fe_story.html?utm_term=.23d05d521f36" target="_blank">proliferation</a> of &#8220;fake news&#8221; websites, public trust in the news media on technology and politics has to be at a historic low.</p>
<p>Last Friday, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161231011622/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-hackers-penetrated-us-electricity-grid-through-a-utility-in-vermont/2016/12/30/8fc90cc4-ceec-11e6-b8a2-8c2a61b0436f_story.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that Russian hackers penetrated the U.S. electricity grid through a utility in Vermont. The Post later <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161231030608/https:/www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-hackers-penetrated-us-electricity-grid-through-a-utility-in-vermont/2016/12/30/8fc90cc4-ceec-11e6-b8a2-8c2a61b0436f_story.html" target="_blank">significantly revised</a> that story to clarify that malware tied to a Russian hacking group known to target companies in the energy sector had succeeded at infecting a single laptop at the utility, and that said laptop was never connected to the power grid.</p>
<p>To many already doubtful of the Obama administration&#8217;s claims about Russian hacking involvement in the election, The Post&#8217;s flub was yet another example of a left-leaning media establishment eager to capitalize on the Russian election-hacking narrative.</p>
<p>&#8220;From Russian hackers burrowed deep within the US electrical grid, ready to plunge the nation into darkness at the flip of a switch, an hour and a half later the story suddenly became that a single non-grid laptop had a piece of malware on it and that the laptop was not connected to the utility grid in any way,&#8221; <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2017/01/01/fake-news-and-how-the-washington-post-rewrote-its-story-on-russian-hacking-of-the-power-grid/#27b35ac8291e" target="_blank">wrote</a> in <em>Forbes</em>.</p>
<p>Not that the American public is the best arbiter of truth and fiction. As <em>Rolling Stone</em> notes, despite the fact that election officials found virtually no voter fraud in the 2016 election, an <a href="https://today.yougov.com/news/2016/12/27/belief-conspiracies-largely-depends-political-iden/" target="_blank">Economist/YouGov poll</a> conducted last month suggests that 50 percent of all Clinton voters believe the Russians hacked vote tallies. Not to be outdone, 62 percent of Trump voters said they believe <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/trump-illegal-voting-clinton-231860" target="_blank">Trump&#8217;s assertion</a> that &#8220;millions&#8221; of undocumented immigrants likely voted in the election.</p>
<p>The public might also be deeply suspicious of hacking claims from a government that practically invented the art of meddling in foreign elections. As <strong>Nina Agrawal</strong> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-us-intervention-foreign-elections-20161213-story.html" target="_blank">observes</a> in <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>, the &#8220;U.S. has a long history of attempting to influence presidential elections in other countries – it’s done so as many as 81 times between 1946 and 2000, according to a database amassed by political scientist Dov Levin of Carnegie Mellon University.&#8221; Also, when it comes to hacking power plants, the U.S. and Israel have probably done more damage than anyone else with their incredibly complex Stuxnet virus, which was created as a weapon designed to delay Iran&#8217;s nuclear ambitions and opened a virtual Pandora&#8217;s Box.</p>
<p>In response to the alleged hacks, the Obama administration <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/30/obama-response-to-russian-hacking-does-not-go-far-enough-say-experts.html" target="_blank">has expelled 35 Russian intelligence officials</a> and imposed <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20161229.aspx" target="_blank">a series of economic sanctions</a> on individuals and companies the administration says are connected to the DNC intrusions. The administration&#8217;s response has been criticized as lackluster and ineffectual, but it&#8217;s not entirely clear what else the White House could do publicly without risking retaliation in kind or worse.</p>
<p>However, the operative word there is &#8220;publicly.&#8221; Just as the administration almost certainly is not releasing all of the intelligence data that lead to its conclusion, I suspect that some of the U.S. response will materialize in ways that won&#8217;t be publicly acknowledged by this outgoing administration.</p>

      <p>The most scary part in this whole deal is the dissing of the government and intelligence services. Please remember that the last administration that came to power sowing distrust of government and disregard of intelligence was followed 9 months later by 9/11. Then after the intelligence community was politicized and started telling the administration what they wanted to hear, they produced the questionable WMD evidence that has the US still fighting that war.</p>

<p>Former CIA Dep. Dir. of Terrorism on Assange being a pedophile, now to be sued for slander by Wikileaks.</p>
<p>Maybe this is why no one believes the CIA even if they told the truth. For once.</p>

<p>Of course, it&#8217;s well known that</p>
<p>1. Russian hackers NEVER use Tor and<br />
2. The NSA has NEVER compromised Tor</p>
<p>There are none so creduluous as those who want to believe.</p>
<p>As it happens, US politics is already thoroughly corrupt far beyond anything the Russians could achieve in their wildest dreams. Things that are illegal in other democracies are normal in the US: politicians choosing their voters (gerrymandering); unlimited corporate expenditure on lobbying; and voting machines that can be and have been hacked (see <a href="http://www.blackboxvoting.org" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.blackboxvoting.org</a>).</p>
<p>It would be a pity if it took a nuclear war to change all that.</p>

      <p>The IP addresses are not the only data included in the STIX files. And the presence of TOR exit nodes is meaningless except to analyze whether the attack was performed via TOR.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that TOR has been de-anonymized under certain circumstances. We do not know what the NSA may or may not know about this traffic. Further, they have the power of FISA courts and subpoenas, so may know more about the other IP addresses than we outsiders.</p>
<p>But in any event, the case was never based on the IP addresses, but on common factors with other attacks, unmasking of the URL shortening service used in the CnC in the attack, and other factors.</p>
<p>The STIX file includes the hashes of the attack vector files that were identified.</p>
<p>One should not abandon skepticism, given the stakes, and the resources available to the players on this stage.</p>
<p>But there is far better evidence that the Russians were involved, than there is that they weren&#8217;t.</p>

      <p>Loved the article.  But really the comments are a great way to get a feel for the craziness of the whole country right now.  Most people that work in cyber that I have met and talked too disregard anything from the the three letter folks because they choose not to be manipulated by the conversation.  I love the way you can follow the craziness from the source to watching it regurgitated as fact in a comments section on any site.  We live in interesting times.  I hope we can survive this mess.</p>

      <p>I find it interesting how eagerly people embrace certainties (&#8220;there is no evidence&#8221; or &#8220;the Russians did it&#8221;).</p>

      <p>Very good and informative article. However it, like nearly every other article on the subject, ignores the most important piece of information in all this. Julian Assange &#8212; you know, the founder/head of Wikileaks, who actually released the &#8220;hacked&#8221; emails to the public &#8212; has assured us that he got the material from a DNC insider.</p>
<p>Should we trust Assange? Should we trust Clapper? Hmmm . . . Tough choice.</p>
<p>They could both be telling is &#8220;the truth&#8221;. There is abundant evidence that the Russians &#8212; or someone pretending to be Russians &#8212; penetrated both the DNC and the RNC. But should we believe that they were the only ones? Probably so did the British, the French, the Dutch, the Israelis, the Bangladeshis and a couple score of script kiddies working from their parents&#8217; basements.</p>
<p>It may be that Clapper is being truthful (for an arbitrary value of &#8220;truthful&#8221;), in telling us that the Russians (or someone pretending to be clumsy Russians) penterated those systems, but he simply cannot know who gave the goods to Wikileaks.</p>
<p>Occam&#8217;s Razor suggests that Assange is telling us the truth about that.</p>

      <p>Sorry, but the Russian hack theory has been debunked so many times by now that it isn&#8217;t even funny.</p>
<p>Here is what probably really happened:</p>
<p>Evidence – much better evidence than has been produced so far – is building that any hacks – as opposed to leaks – that were done to the DNC were likely done by Ukrainian hackers as a false flag to get Russia blamed for them.</p>
<p>Everyone should read these articles:</p>

<p>Russia Hacking the Election the Inside Story<br />
<a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/12/russia-hacking-election-inside-story-2.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/12/russia-hacking-election-inside-story-2.html</a></p>
<p>I had been suspicious of the Russian theory due to Jeffrey Carr’s articles on Medium (Google for them, they are vital to understanding the issues) which debunk most of the evidence. I wondered why it was that the equally logical<br />
possibility that Ukrainian hackers might have done the hacks as a false flag operation to frame Russian for them was being ignored completely.</p>
<p>I noted that the “evidence” that the compile times for the malware were allegedly during “Russian business hours.” If you look at the time zone maps, you’ll see Moscow is just one hour ahead of Kiev, Ukraine. So that “evidence”<br />
was meaningless.</p>
<p>Secondly, I read an article by WordFence, a company which does WordPress blog security, that the PHP malware used was provably Ukrainian and open source, i.e., available to anyone aware of it. There is nothing “Russian” about it.</p>
<p>Then I found the above articles which pretty clearly show connect the dots evidence that the head of CrowdStrike, the company that the FBI RELIED ON for the “evidence”, is run by an anti-Russian Russian ex-pat who has DIRECT<br />
connections to Ukrainian ultra-nationalists who are DIRECTLY connected to the Democratic National Committee and who themselves have DIRECT connections to apparently competent Ukrainian hackers. I<br />
mean these articles lay it out in chapter and verse based on publicly available data.</p>
<p>I now believe that it is entirely possible that the entire DNC “hack” accusation is a false flag operation organized by Ukrainian individuals, with or without Ukrainian state help, and with or without the knowledge of the Clinton campaign, for the purpose of further ruining US relations with Russia.</p>
<p>The DNC documents themselves were likely “leaked”, not “hacked”. But hacks were done solely for the purpose of getting Russia blamed for them.</p>
<p>This is potentially a HUGE story. If the head of CrowdStrike &#8211; and possibly members of the DNC itself or the Clinton campaign organization &#8211; were knowingly in league with Ukraine ultranationalists who in turn were in contact with competent Ukraine hackers in a false flag attempt to increase the bad relations between the US and Russia for their own political reasons, this would be a massive conspiracy which would put egg on the faces of everyone involved, including the entire US intelligence<br />
apparatus, the mainstream media and many other people. The entire Russia-bashing industry would be called into question.</p>
<p>I suspect that what happened is as follows:</p>
<p>1) The DNC and the Clinton campaign decided to tar Trump with the &#8220;Russian agent&#8221; meme.</p>
<p>2) At some point the DNC and the Clinton campaign became aware that there were one or more serious leaks of information from the DNC &#8211; leaks, not hacks.</p>
<p>3) At this point the DNC and the Clinton campaign decided to fake a Russian hacking effort in order to 1) cover the leaks, and 2) use it to continue to tar Trump as a &#8220;Russian agent.&#8221;</p>
<p>4) In order to make a believable case, they contacted some ultranationalist Ukrainians who were involved in the election and who had contact with some reasonable competent anti-Russian Ukrainian hacker collectives. These<br />
collectives faked a Russian hack of the DNC.</p>
<p>5) They then called in CrowdStrike, which was already on the DNC/Clinton payroll, a company headed by an anti-Putin Russian ex-pat who would be ready to &#8220;validate&#8221; the &#8220;Russian hack&#8221; by accepting flimsy circumstantial and spoofable &#8220;evidence&#8221; as sufficient for attribution.</p>
<p>Evidence which I remind you have been totally debunked by Jeffrey Carr and others.</p>
<p>By the way, all the evidence supposedly connecting the variously named &#8220;APT&#8221; groups to Russian intelligence are similarly based on flimsy, circumstantial and easily spoofable &#8220;evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>6) Then they refused to allow the FBI to use their own infosec forensic experts to inspect the evidence, relying on CrowdStrike officer Shawn Henry&#8217;s background as a former FBI Assistant Director to deflect the FBI into accepting CrowdStrike&#8217;s &#8220;investigation&#8221; as adequate.</p>
<p>The latter fact pretty clearly proves that the DNC and the Clinton campaign were complicit in this attempt to interfere in a Federal investigation into what was an attempt by foreign nationals to influence the US election.</p>
<p>This may all sound like &#8220;conspiracy theory&#8221;. There is of course no proof to date of any of this. But the ircumstances are just as likely as the theory that Russia decided to &#8220;influence the election&#8221; by hacking the DNC using the<br />
most incompetent hackers and poorest OPSEC they could produce, leaving a trail pointing directly at them.</p>
<p>The one thing we can know is that in intelligence and hacking operations, Occam&#8217;s Razor &#8211; the notion that the simplest solution is usually correct &#8211; does not apply. There is too much obfuscation, misdirection and manipulation<br />
involved in such operations.</p>
<p>The theory that someone has conducted a false flag operation to frame Russia for hacks is at least as credible as the idea that Russia would attempt to influence the election by randomly hacking the DNC. The latter really makes no<br />
sense, given the probability that whatever hacks Russia could do would be less influential on the election than the actions of the candidates themselves &#8211; which the Russians would know. And the Russians would also know that if caught, there could be serious repercussions in relations with the US &#8211; which means not using incompetent third-party hacker groups who leave trails and use outdated<br />
malware.</p>
<p>Some investigative journalists need to follow up on the articles cited above and see where they lead. If this theory is proven, it will be Pulitzer Prize for someone &#8211; and major egg for the US intelligence community, the mainstream<br />

      <p>It strikes me as odd that one well-known security researcher, who rejects the combined word of the FBI and NSA, has zero problem accepting the ramblings of an anonymous Internet poster who asserts the Sony Pictures incident was an inside job.</p>

      <p>The FBI and NSA (along with the CIA) are known for submitting reports to the President and other cabinet members without any substantiating evidence.  So why should anyone take their word over a rambling anonymous internet poster, who in all likelihood has reported accurately on incidents in the past?  In the intelligence field HUMINT resources are classified by both their reliability (A-D) in previous reports and in the probability of this report (1-5) being true based upon other evidence, not necessarily published, that is available to the reporting agency or person.  So yes, it may strike individuals as odd, but in the real world you have to consider the source and governments lie more than people do.</p>

      <p>The bottom line, regardless of who the target/victim is, breaking into systems connected to the internet is almost trivial. Anyone who has even a modicum of computer knowledge can discover huge amounts of data, insecure systems, weak passwords, improperly configured systems, unprotected databases, etc. with little more effort than entering a search term in Google or Shodan or Censys. Security through obscurity (ob-security) is the mindset that many companies &amp; organizations seem to follow. As long as there is human control and direct interaction with systems, this will continue to be the case.</p>
