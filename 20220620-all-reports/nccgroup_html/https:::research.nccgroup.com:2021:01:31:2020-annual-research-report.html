<h2 id="ExecutiveSummary">Executive Summary: Research at NCC Group (2020)</h2>



<p>In 2020, NCC Group delivered into the thousands of dedicated research days, pursuing research spanning a number of areas, including hardware &amp; embedded systems security, applied cryptography, programming languages, machine learning, mobile privacy, cloud &amp; container security, exploit development, industrial control systems/OT security, threat intelligence, and beyond. We delivered <strong>96</strong> research papers, whitepapers, and technical blog posts, as well as at least <strong>47</strong> conference presentations, in venues including Black Hat USA, Shmoocon, OWASP Global Appsec, KubeCon + CloudNativeCon, Chaos Communication Congress (CCC), Infosec World, Black Hat Asia, RSAC, and DEF CON. We released at least <strong>18</strong> new open source tools, as well as our first-ever open dataset, and released 121 blog posts on research.nccgroup.com, attracting 193,000 visitors.<br><br>We also published a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/08/21/immortalising-20-years-of-epic-research/" target="_blank">20 year retrospective on research at NCC Group</a>, highlighting some of our favourite projects from the past two decades, from over 200 whitepapers and conference presentations which included key outputs from previous cyber security acquisitions including NGS Software (2008), iSEC Partners Inc. (2010), Matasano Security (2012), Intrepidus Group (2012), FortConsult A/S (2014), Fox-IT (2015), Payment Software Company Inc (2016), and VSR Inc. (2016).<br><br>We continue our research partnerships with a variety of institutions including the University College London Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Intensive Science, and our membership within the UK Academic Centers of Excellence in Cyber Security Research via the UK CyberInvest scheme. From a standardization perspective, we continue our long-running active contributions to security-related proposals within the C standards committee, as well as contribute to the development of the Center for Internet Security’s CIS Benchmarks for Kubernetes. We have also been active within the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process, where members of our Cryptography Services practice have proposed a post-quantum lattice-based signature scheme that was announced by NIST in July 2020 to be a round 3 finalist. We were founding members of the Open Source Security Foundation, a group within the Linux Foundation which “brings together the industry’s most important open source security initiatives and the individuals and companies that support them” to help secure the open source ecosystem. We also co-authored with the UK’s National Cyber Security Center an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) draft. <br><br>NCC Group supported academia extensively. We ran the Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research (ACE-CSR) virtual conference (June 2020) and the NCSC PhD Winter School Event (December 2020) in partnership with the UK’s National Cyber Security Center. NCC Group also sat on the research funding review board for the UK’s PETRAS National Centre of Excellence for IoT Systems Cybersecurity.<br><br>We also served on a number of advisory boards including the Industrial Advisory Board at King&#8217;s College London, the Governing Board and Technical Advisory Council of the Open Source Security Foundation, the Executive Steering Board for Internet of Things Security Foundation (IoTSF), the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) Research Advisory Panel, among others. Several NCC Group Researchers (Edward Torkington, Phillip Langlois, and Dirk-Jan Mollema) were recognized among the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)’s Most Valuable Security Researchers in 2020. <br><br>Researchers across NCC Group served as leaders, mentors, and peer reviewers across the information security community. This year, we were invited to serve on the program committees and review boards of a number of high-profile computer security research venues including: USENIX Enigma, IEEE Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS), Black Hat USA, DEF CON Wall of Sheep/Packet Hacking Village, USENIX Workshop On Offensive Technologies (WOOT), and many others, and performed outreach, mentorship, and gave invited technical talks within high schools, colleges, universities and Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions in North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and around the world.<br></p>



<h2 id="MessageFromJenniferFernick">Message from the Global Head of Research: <br>Security Research in 2020, 2021, and beyond</h2>



<p>It has been a year that forced our priorities into sharp focus. In a world stripped of much of the ornament and distraction of daily life, we have been able to see with a rare sharpness the way that informational asymmetries, algorithmic platform-driven influence, and the privilege to manage one’s exposure to risk radically change the outcomes of individual human lives and of entire nations. </p>



<p>Into 2021, we will need to take a hard look at the socio-technical decisions we’ve made in a time when our lives changed more in a week than they might ever have in a lifetime. These questions are bigger than remote work &#8211; they are about the entrenched, rapidly-deployed systems (and their accumulating security debt) rolled out at the beginning of the pandemic, which silently and often radically changed the internals of organizations around the globe. </p>



<p>Does remote work change enterprises’ exposure to security risk? Certainly somewhat, although this doesn’t feel like the security revolution it often seemed reported to be. Few things actually change in this scenario if you had already begun with the fair assumption that most networks are hostile. <br><br>We’re rapidly approaching a point when companies will no longer be able to patch and insure their way out of security problems &#8211; and it is for this reason and the reasons below that I suggest that we work to both to get better at reducing vulnerabilities at scale, while simultaneously seeking to deeply understand where (and why) even the world’s best tooling fails to find many of the high-impact vulnerabilities in complex codebases. </p>



<p><strong>What do I see on the horizon for 2021?</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Attacking and defending full-stack artificial intelligence systems in production environments, because after several hundred academic papers and arguably not a single real-world proof of concept, it is time to partner with data-driven companies to literally run the risk before powerful adversaries do so instead. </strong></li><li><strong>As an industry, a movement toward designing for usable security and no longer pushing the burden of security down onto our users only to judge them on their inevitable failures of our own design. </strong></li><li><strong>After rapidly shifting all aspects of our lives online, reclaiming what we can of online privacy through the development &amp; mainstream popularization of privacy-enhancing technologies and their underlying cryptographic protocols. </strong></li><li><strong>A groundswell of policy interest in platform governance and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and the potentially rapid need for related tooling and novel digital forensics capabilities, including in authenticating the origins of images to combat deepfakes and better understand the origins of misinformation efforts.</strong></li><li><strong>The triviality and ubiquity of vulnerabilities in most IoT devices becoming a reason for security practitioners to pay <em>more</em> attention to IoT, particularly in the domain of things that can improve these products at scale, specifically: standards, regulation, security engineering, and law. A strive toward increased rigor to the research in our industry, where we would see more of: controlled experiments, well-designed testbeds, increased use of meaningful data science, and adoption of methods from the natural sciences to test hypotheses about the effectiveness of security tooling and risk-remediation efforts. </strong></li><li><strong>A deeper commitment to reducing vulnerabilities at scale, through increased investment in research and tooling, and multi-stakeholder investments in securing core infrastructure to make high-impact reductions in dependency risks downstream where possible. </strong></li><li><strong>As a society, beginning to take seriously the real risk of harm in cyber-physical systems, and people outside of our field more readily understanding that security is a <em>prerequisite</em> to safety, because we cannot make assurances about the safety (and while we’re at it: the ethics and privacy) of systems that we do not control. </strong></li></ul>



<h2 id="AppliedCryptography">Applied Cryptography</h2>



<ul><li>At the beginning of the year, Thomas Pornin published parameters for a new elliptic curve for use in Elliptic Curve Cryptography, called Curve9767, in a paper titled <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/009" target="_blank">Efficient Elliptic Curve Operations On Microcontrollers With Finite Field Extensions</a>. In this work, he described a new and efficient elliptic curve with 128-bit security (Curve9767), and released a fully constant-time <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pornin/curve9767" target="_blank">open source implementation of Curve9767</a> as well as a later paper describing an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/454" target="_blank">optimization of Schnorr signature verification</a>. Curve9767 is particularly useful for constrained devices, and works well on small microcontrollers of the ARM Cortex-M0+ class. A summary of this work is available in his blog post, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/04/28/curve9767-and-fast-signature-verification/" target="_blank">Curve9767 and Fast Signature Verification</a>.</li><li>In January 2020, Jennifer Fernick discussed with BankInfoSecurity <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/windows-vulnerability-researchers-demonstrate-exploits-a-13614?highlight=true" target="_blank">vulnerabilities in the Windows CryptoAPI (CVE-2020-0601) recently-disclosed by the U.S. National Security Agency</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>In February 2020, Balazs Bucsay wrote about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/02/04/properly-signed-certificates-on-cpe-devices/" target="_blank">properly signed certificates on CPE devices</a>. This work was inspired by the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/nstarke/a611a19aab433555e91c656fe1f030a9" target="_blank">recent finding by two security researchers</a> that a publicly available Netgear firmware image contains two properly signed and valid TLS certificates that contained private keys, trivially enabling Man-In-The-Middle attacks. Since the vendor’s published advisory lacked remediation advice, this blog post suggested multiple potential low-cost mitigation recommendations, described their tradeoffs while noting that they are nevertheless better than the common practice of using self-signed, hard-coded, or no certificates for items of Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), such as consumer routers.&nbsp;</li><li>Also that month, Eric Schorn published his whitepaper, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/02/17/whitepaper-a-tour-of-curve-25519-in-erlang/" target="_blank">A Tour of Curve 25519 in Erlang</a>, which offered an introduction to elliptic curve cryptography theory alongside a practical implementation in Erlang. The implementation code associated with this paper was also published.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>In March 2020, Aleksandar Kircanski and Gerald Doussot published, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/03/24/smart-contracts-inside-sgx-enclaves-common-security-bug-patterns/" target="_blank">Smart Contracts Inside SGX Enclaves: Common Security Bug Patterns</a>. In this work, they discussed nuances to using Intel SGX in practice for the purpose of Ethereum smart contracts, and outlined 9 classes of security issues that we have observed in real-world smart contract implementations. These issues included: rogue smart contract code injection on TEE nodes; leakage of contract state ciphertext changes; smart contracts using non-constant time cryptographic implementations; the inherent non-constant nature of a smart contract’s virtual machine; input, state and output length leaks; data store, operating system file system and database process query processing access pattern side channels; cross-contract calls; potential for inadequate tamper-resistance; and the range of side channel attacks possible against TEEs in general. They concluded that for the purpose of running confidential smart contracts, using a trusted execution environment (TEE) presents a considerable attack surface to malicious parties with a presence on the host executing the contract and, to a lesser extent, to passive network observers. This was due to factors such as the existence of side channels in smart contract execution, the existence of side channels in data stores running outside of SGX, as well as ciphertext/plaintext length leaks.</li><li>Eric Schorn published his <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/02/24/reviewing-verifiable-random-functions/" target="_blank">two-part blog series on Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs)</a>, popularized due to their usefulness in blockchain applications. In <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/02/24/reviewing-verifiable-random-functions/">Part 1</a> of this series he introduced VRFs in the context of other well-known cryptographic primitives, described their use cases, and highlighted over two dozen topics to consider during a cryptographic implementation review of VRFs, including questions regarding ciphersuite configuration, cryptographic key lifecycle, rigor of cryptographic implementation in source code, and code completeness. In <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/04/03/exploring-verifiable-random-functions-in-code/" target="_blank">Part 2</a>, he published a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/nccgroup/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-06" target="_blank">fully self-contained Python3 reference implementation</a> matching the ECVRF-EDWARDS25519-SHA512-Elligator2 ciphersuite configuration found in the latest <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf/06/" target="_blank">IETF CRFG VRF Internet Draft</a>.</li><li>In March 2020, Aleksandar Kircanski and Terence Tarvis published their whitepaper, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/03/26/whitepaper-coinbugs-enumerating-common-blockchain-implementation-level-vulnerabilities/" target="_blank">Coinbugs: Enumerating Common Blockchain Implementation-Level Vulnerabilities</a>. To begin, the authors identified a gap in literature regarding implementation-level security bugs that commonly occur in basic proof-of-work blockchain node implementations, and wrote this paper to systematize the bugs discovered by themselves and across the research community during the first decade of Bitcoin’s existence. This paper outlines ten broad vulnerability categories and known real-world examples of their existence and exploitation, ultimately tracing Bitcoin’s introduction of several novel bug classes which are of interest to security researchers, and setting a baseline set of vulnerability types for which proof-of-work blockchain implementations should be tested.&nbsp;</li><li>In April 2020, Paul Bottinelli published a blog post about the cryptographic mechanisms underlying COVID-19 contract-tracing apps, ultimately discussing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/04/17/how-cryptography-is-used-to-monitor-the-spread-of-covid-19/" target="_blank">how cryptography is used to monitor the spread of COVID-19</a>. In this work, he showcased how Apple and Google’s proposal for contact-tracing uses cryptographic constructions to trace individuals without sacrificing privacy. For example, he highlighted both that:<ul><li>1. It should be computationally infeasible, without knowledge of the Daily Tracing Key, to link the Rolling Proximity Identifiers together</li><li>2. It should be computationally infeasible to obtain the Tracing Key of a user given a set of their Daily Tracing Keys, as may be disclosed if the user has tested positive</li></ul></li><li>&#8230;And that these aspects rely on the security of the underlying cryptographic primitives namely: <strong><em>HKDF </em></strong>(a specific Key Derivation Function that ensures that the keys obtained are cryptographically strong, provided that the underlying hash function is secure) and <strong><em>HMAC</em></strong> (a Message Authentication Code with SHA-256 as the underlying hash function) and on the security of the hash function they use, ultimately enabling us to understand privacy guarantees to individuals through familiar and well-studied cryptographic primitives and their computational (in)feasibility.&nbsp; </li></ul>

<ul><li>In June 2020, Paul Bottinelli published on the <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/24/security-considerations-of-zk-snark-parameter-multi-party-computation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Security Considerations of zk-SNARK Parameter Multi-Party Computation</a>. Since secure generation of parameters for zk-SNARKs is a crucial step in the trustworthiness of the resulting proof system, this work highlighted some potential pitfalls and important security considerations of the implementation of zk-SNARKs. Beyond typical cryptographic considerations, for example, security audits for zk-SNARKs must include: (1) Secure deletion of the parameters (since the security of the multi-party computation ceremony relies entirely on the fact that at least one participant needs to securely delete their contribution for the resulting parameters to be generated honestly); (2) Adequate randomness (the use of standardized cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) seeded with enough entropy to support the security needs of the parameters); (3) A rigorous, well-defined process for the trusted setup ceremony (including verifying all the transactions and validate all the parameters generated); and (4) Security and correctness of the source code implementing the trusted setup ceremony.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<h2 id="PublicReports">Public Reporting on Open Source Security Audits</h2>



<p>NCC Group has a long history of publicly-reported security audits of critical components of open source software as well as select proprietary systems. Of these reports, those labelled “Public Report” were developed as a part of a paid engagement with an NCC Group client for NCC Group to conduct and publish the findings of a security audit on in-scope components, whereas those labelled “Research Report” were internally funded and pursued by researchers at NCC Group. In 2020, NCC Group delivered 7 Public Reports and 1 Research Report, across a range of technologies including cryptographic implementations for high-value cryptocurrencies and the security of a popular open-source real-time operating system (RTOS), as well as of the Google Pixel 4/4XL and Pixel 4a smartphones as a part of NCC Group’s role as an <a href="https://www.iotevolutionworld.com/iot/articles/445890-ioxt-alliance-adds-four-authorized-labs-certification-program.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ioXt Authorized Lab</a>.<br><br>Our 2020 Public Reports and public Research Reports include:&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>In May 2020, Jeremy Boone and Ilya Zhuravlev published a <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/05/26/research-report-zephyr-and-mcuboot-security-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research Report on their security assessment of the Zephyr open source real-time operating system (RTOS) and the MCUboot bootloader</a>, uncovering 25 vulnerabilities affecting the Zephyr RTOS and <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/11/technical-advisory-arm-mbedos-usb-mass-driver-storage-memory-corruption/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1 vulnerability affecting MCUboot</a>. Many of these 26 vulnerabilities were also <a href="https://www.embedded-computing.com/guest-blogs/another-iot-security-uh-oh-26-flaws-in-open-source-zephyr-and-mcuboot-stacks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed in depth by Jennifer Fernick with Embedded Computing Design</a>. These findings include both locally and remotely exploitable memory corruption vulnerabilities, multiple paths that allow a compromised user application to escalate privilege to kernel mode, as well as multiple weaknesses in the design of certain exploit mitigation systems that exist within the kernel. The scope of this project included the robustness of the secure boot implementation, the kernel mode execution protection, and the kernel driver review. Our major findings included a number of both remote attack vectors and locally exploitable weaknesses, and a number of places in which insufficient argument validation in system call interfaces led to exploitable weaknesses, where in one example, a compromised userspace application was able to reveal the contents of restricted kernel memory. Furthermore, while Zephyr implemented a range of kernel hardening measures, many of them were found to contain weaknesses, and further countermeasures and mitigations are necessary to limit the impact of memory safety violations and reduce the likelihood that a single memory corruption vulnerability can result in a complete system compromise. The Governing Board Chair of the Zephyr Project <a href="https://www.zephyrproject.org/zephyrs-security-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded positively</a> to our research and coordinated disclosure. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/iot/26-iot-flaws-enable-denial-of-service-attacks-privilege-escalation/d/d-id/1337967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This work was also discussed in Dark Reading</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>In July 2020, Jon Szymaniak released a tool, <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/07/22/depthcharge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Depthcharge</a>, which is an extensible Python 3 toolkit designed to aid security researchers when analyzing a customized, product-specific build of the U-Boot bootloader. He also published a proof-of-concept attack about a Sonos Symfonisk speaker, which leveraged NXP’s High Assurance Boot (HAB), despite being one the lower-cost offerings within the Sonos product line. Unfortunately, the bootloader included “out-of-the box” contained a type of vulnerability that we’ve previously observed in other embedded platforms – a functionality-reduced console contains an unauthenticated command that can be abused as an arbitrary memory read-write operation,leading to bypass of secure boot on the device. Through this, he demonstrated that all it takes is one extraneous enabled feature in a U-Boot configuration to undermine all the hard work involved in properly extending a hardware-backed root of trust, thus emphasizing the importance of configuring and auditing the security properties of open source security tools to meet the needs of one’s individual product and threat model. This work was also presented in a webinar hosted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTKMi3Is5x8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hardwear.io</a>, and discussed in a contributed piece to Electronic Products on <a href="https://www.electronicproducts.com/eliminating-security-flaws-in-open-source-software-for-embedded-systems/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eliminating security flaws in open-source software for embedded systems</a>, as well as in a <a href="https://www.tfir.io/how-to-secure-embedded-iot-devices-with-open-source-jon-szymaniak-ncc-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video interview with TFIR</a>.<br></li></ul>

He explained how early in the product development cycle of embedded systems, threat modelling can help identify key security requirements for a system that are difficult, costly, or impossible to introduce into an embedded system at a later time. He gave specific questions to ask of your component vendors when selecting the platform, processor, bootloaders and operating system of your target system, and offered other considerations in vendor selection around patch lifecycles and manufacturing and supply chain risks.&nbsp;</li><li>In October 2020, Rob Wood gave a presentation about <a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/nccgroup/events/webinar-building-secure-devices-in-untrusted-factories-hosted-by-alberta-iot-96579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">building secure devices in untrusted factories</a>. In this presentation, he outlined that since with very few exceptions, no electronics manufacturer actually designs and manufactures every single component of a device in their own factory, hardware and manufacturing supply chains introduce considerable risk that threat actors could gain an opportunity to defraud, steal, counterfeit, or otherwise undermine the security of the produced electronic devices.</li><li>In October 2020, Ilya Zhuravlev and Jeremy Boone published “<a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/10/15/theres-a-hole-in-your-soc-glitching-the-mediatek-bootrom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There’s A Hole In Your SoC: Glitching The MediaTek BootROM</a>. This blog post describes NCC Group’s methodology for characterizing the boot process of the MediaTek MT8163V system-on-chip (64-bit ARM Cortex-A), as well as the design of an apparatus that is capable of reliably producing a fault injection attack against the SoC. Ultimately, our results show that the MediaTek BootROM is susceptible to glitching, allowing an &nbsp;adversary to bypass signature verification of the preloader. This circumvents all secure boot functionality and enables the execution of unsigned preloader images, completely undermining the hardware root of trust. This work was cited in a paper by the Microsoft Azure Sphere team on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2020/11/Seven-Properties-of-Highly-Secured-Devices-2nd-Edition-R1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Seven Properties of Highly Secured Devices</a>, in their discussion of how highly-secured devices have a hardware root of trust.

This vulnerability pertained to containerd, a container runtime underpinning Docker and common Kubernetes configurations, which handles abstractions related to containerization and provides APIs to manage container lifecycles. He found that the containerd shim API is exposed over an abstract namespace Unix domain socket that is accessible from the root network namespace, resulting in non-user namespaced containers with host networking being able to access this API and cause containerd-shim to perform dangerous actions and spin up arbitrarily privileged containers, enabling container escapes and escalation to full root privileges on the host. <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cloud/common-container-manager-%20is-vulnerable-to-dangerous-exploit/d/d-id/1339607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An article in Dark Reading discussed these findings on how a common container manager Is vulnerable to a dangerous exploit</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>He elaborated on this work in his blog post, <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/12/10/abstract-shimmer-cve-2020-15257-host-networking-is-root-equivalent-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ABSTRACT SHIMMER (CVE-2020-15257): Host Networking is root-Equivalent, Again</a>, a technical discussion of the underlying vulnerability of CVE-2020-15257, and how it can be exploited, going deeper into the process that led to finding the issue, the practicalities of exploiting the vulnerability itself, various complications around fixing the issue, and concluding that abstract namespace Unix domain sockets can be extremely dangerous when applied to containerized contexts (especially because containers will often share network namespaces with each other). He mused that it is unclear how the risks of abstract namespace sockets was not taken into account by the core infrastructure responsible for running the majority of the world’s containers. It is also unclear how this behavior went unnoticed for so long. If anything, it suggests that containerd has not undergone a proper security assessment.<br></li></ul>

<h2 id="AI">Data Science, Machine Learning, &amp; A.I.</h2>



<p>Throughout 2020, we continued our ongoing research into circumventing real-world A.I.-driven systems through adversarial examples, and have built and trained a number of models and developed demos of high-efficacy adversarial examples. Into 2021 we have renewed our commitment and increased our support for research into offensive security against A.I. systems and how to consequently defend (and formalize the limits to defenses of) real-world systems against an increasingly diverse set of attack types. Beyond the field of adversarial A.I., we have also been studying many aspects of machine learning, not only as an attack target but also to enhance the efficacy of both offensive and defensive security techniques.</p>



<ul><li>In April 2020, Liam Stevenson of NCC Group’s Managed Detection and Response group authored a blog post on <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/04/29/practical-machine-learning-for-random-filename-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">practical machine learning for random filename detection</a>, which explored the efficacy of using specific machine learning algorithms to analyze the so-called random filenames generated by malware or implants when creating files on a disk to avoid traditional Indicator of Compromise signatures. In this work, he looked at the use of N-gram scoring of filenames, to calculate the probability of seeing various trigrams, and using the unlikeliness of trigrams in recently-observed filenames as an indicator of “how random” the randomness of a given malware filename generated actually is, and giving advice on parameter tuning and other intervention measures which can be used to increase of decrease the rate of false positives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>In May/June 2020, we published the <a href="https://newsroom.nccgroup.com/documents/a-report-on-the-cyber-security-implications-of-deepfakes-by-university-college-london-96562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whitepaper</a> and associated blog post, <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/01/exploring-deepfake-capabilities-mitigation-strategies-with-university-college-london/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exploring DeepFake Capabilities &amp; Mitigation Strategies with University College London</a>, which was the result of a collaborative research partnership between NCC Group and the University College London (UCL) Center for Doctoral Training in Data-Intensive Science. This paper discusses the cybersecurity implications of deepfakes, including the difficulty and efficacy of creating deepfaked content using extant open source methods., ultimately concluding that open source frameworks offer technically impressive deepfakes, which however are not as convincing as would be possible through the use of present-day GPU clusters. The paper covered deepfake production workflows, limitations of deepfake technology, and methods for detection. This research included a proof-of-concept in which the students deepfaked NCC Group’s Matt Lewis into a clip of Daniel Craig in the 2006 film, Casino Royale (pictured below), on consumer hardware and analyzed visual artifacts indicative of its’ synthetic origin.

The difficult consequence of this is that it is likely for the deepfake detection problem to only become asymptotically harder over time, and counterproposing that we instead focus on cryptographically robust authentication mechanisms for audio and video streams to become better, as a society, at being confident when a video clip or audio file has <em>not</em> been synthetically generated.&nbsp;</li><li>Clinton Carpene and Peter Hannay gave a presentation titled &#8220;Let&#8217;s Play(AI) Super Metroid!&#8221; where they demonstrated the use of machine learning to automate the SNES classic Super Metroid.</li><li>In, <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/09/02/machine-learning-from-idea-to-reality-a-powershell-case-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Machine learning from idea to reality: A Powershell case study</a> Joost Jansen discussed detecting both ‘offensive’ and obfuscated PowerShell scripts in Splunk using Windows Event Log 4104, leading to detection models that can be used in a real-time environment.&nbsp;</li><li>During summer 2020, we also added two full-time data scientists to our team, who work on both internal- and external-facing research related to both offensive and defensive uses of machine learning, with research publications set throughout 2021.&nbsp;</li><li>We have also renewed our commitment to collaborative research with the University College London’s Center for Doctoral Training in Data Intensive Science for the 2020-2021 academic year, in which we will mentor students on a new project related to machine learning-driven enhancements to the detection of malicious software binaries.&nbsp;</li><li>In October 2020, Gene Meltser presented on the <a href="https://media.conncoll.edu/channel/Enterprise%2BSystems%2BEvents/187660593" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Disinformation on Social Media</a> at Connecticut College, and in our 2021 fiscal year we committed to a fully-funded, dedicated research program understanding and combating technology-mediated disinformation campaigns.</li></ul>

<h2 id="MobilePrivacy">Mobile Privacy&nbsp;</h2>



<ul><li>In August 2020, Neil Bergman published a whitepaper <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/08/24/whitepaper-exploring-the-security-of-kaios-mobile-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exploring the Security of KaiOS Mobile Applications</a>. KaiOS is a mobile operating system forked from the discontinued Firefox OS, in which all the mobile applications running on a KaiOS-based mobile device are built using web technologies, such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. In this paper, he scrutinized pre-installed mobile applications on four different phones running KaiOS, resulting in both a collection of remediated vulnerabilities, as well as constructive product security recommendations for the next generation of KaiOS operating system and its applications. He discussed his findings of remote, and local, HTML injection attacks, which when combined with bypasses in the Content Security Policy can result in the abuse of privileged JavaScript APIs resulting in remote file disclosure or local privilege escalation, as well as explored the security implications of both documented and undocumented JavaScript APIs in the platform and general security risks of the mobile platform.</li><li>At <a href="https://www.rightscon.org/">R</a><a href="https://www.rightscon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ightscon</a> 2020, the “world&#8217;s leading summit on human rights in the digital age,” NCC Group researcher Dan Hastings presented <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90385795/im-a-security-expert-and-this-is-how-robocall-blocking-apps-violate-your-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his work on the privacy-violating behavior of robocall-blocking mobile apps</a>, titled, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/09/many-robocall-blocking-apps-send-your-private-data-without-permission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ironically, iOS robocall-blocking apps are violating your privacy</em></a><em>. </em>This project, an extension of <a href="https://cryptovillage.org/dc27/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his work presented at DEF CON 27</a>, looked at mobile privacy through a human rights and targeted population’s perspective, seeking to illuminate the methods through which technologists can perform deep privacy analysis of mobile applications in use, and demonstrating several new findings of apps promoted to be privacy-promoting that were in fact the exact opposite. Dan also showed that in many cases, mobile apps are not conforming with their data and privacy practices as stated in End User License Agreements, meaning that a deep technical analysis is often <em>required </em>for users to truly understand the privacy impacts of the apps on their phones.&nbsp;</li><li>Inspired by his findings from the robocall-blocking apps project, in the final days of 2020, Dan Hastings presented his new privacy analysis tool at <a href="https://events.ccc.de/about-ccc-events-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chaos Communication Congress</a>. This tool, <a href="https://github.com/nccgroup/solitude" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/nccgroup/solitude" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solitude, is an open source privacy analysis tool that enables anyone to conduct their own privacy investigations on iOS and Android applications</a>. Oftentimes the only way for the end user to figure out where their private data goes once they enter it into a web application or mobile device is through the app’s privacy policy. Privacy policies not only have a notorious history of being difficult to understand but don’t always tell the truth about an application’s data collection practices. Solitude was built to make proxying one’s web and mobile traffic easier, and to thus make the process of conducting privacy investigations of one’s favourite apps more streamlined and straightforward. Solitude can be configured to look for any data input into a mobile or web application, and reveal where that data is going. Whether a curious novice or a more advanced researcher, Solitude makes the process of evaluating an app’s privacy accessible for everyone.</li></ul>

<h2 id="IoT">Securing Connected Environments</h2>



<p>A great deal of work within cybersecurity research presently involves securing connected environments. On one hand, it is easy as researchers to dismiss pursuing further research into compromising internet-of-things (IoT) devices because it is so often trivial to do. On the other hand, we must acknowledge that technologies are not simply abandoned because they are too easy to hack &#8211; rather, we must understand the world in which we live and what it is becoming, and endeavour to secure it as well as possible, perhaps even <em>especially</em> in cases where the devices are ubiquitous, the market is rapidly growing, the impacts can affect human safety, and the vulnerabilities are readily found and exploits are often relatively simple to construct.<br><br>Fortunately, in 2020 we finally began to see some positive developments toward meaningful improvement of IoT security, likely driven in no small part by countless examples of security research illustrating the overall inadequate state of security across a range of consumer and industrial IoT devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Progress toward improved IoT security in 2020 perhaps was most notably observed in the passing of the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act in the United States, which directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop standards and guidelines on how federal government agencies should appropriately use and manage IoT devices connected to information systems. We also saw numerous global examples of additional progress in this space, including Singapore’s announced intention for Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme for IoT devices, he UK’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) announcing new legislation making manufacturers accountable for building robust security standards in early, from the very design stage of their products, the European ETSI Technical Committee on Cybersecurity releasing a globally applicable standard for IoT security, and the introduction of IoT security laws and frameworks in Australia, California, and Oregon.</p>



<h3 id="SecureThings">The Internet of (Secure) Things&nbsp;</h3>



<p>From an <strong>industry</strong> perspective, in 2020, NCC Group was one of the early members of ioXt, which aims to build confidence in IoT products through international, harmonised, and standardised security and privacy requirements, product compliance programs, and public transparency of those requirements and programs. NCC Group is an <a href="https://www.ioxtalliance.org/authorized-labs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IoXT Authorized Lab</a> (discussed further <a href="https://securitybrief.eu/story/ncc-group-chosen-to-help-improve-iot-security-standards-for-all-sectors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>), providing third-party validation and testing of relevant products for the Alliance’s Certification Program. One of the most notable aspects of IoXT is their security pledge:</p>

<p>From a <strong>government and policy</strong> perspective, we contributed to some of the discourse around government procurement of IoT devices, the generally woeful state of IoT device security, and the need for higher cybersecurity standards in IoT devices around the world:</p>



<ul><li>NCC Group’s Peter Hannay co-authored a <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/cyber-security-network-things-nots-military-systems-muhammad-imran-malik-ian-noel-mcateer-peter-hannay-ahmed-ibrahim-zubair-baig-guanglou-zheng/e/10.1201/9781003010463-14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book chapter on the security of IoT devices in military networks</a>, together with Ph.D student Imran Malik. In this publication, they discuss networked devices (“Network of Things,” or “NoTs”), and how the security of NoT has not kept pace with the rapid advances in innovation and deployment of NoT devices, thus creating significant risks to all associated information assets. They argue that this security risk is prevalent in government networks due to pressures toward speed and cost-effectiveness of technology deployment, thus risking reliability and efficacy of military operations. The paper stresses the need for improving security posture when NoTs are employed within military systems and proposes measures to address the ever-evolving cyber security challenges in NoTs.</li><li>In December 2020, Rob Wood was interviewed in an <a href="https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/feature/Understand-the-IoT-Cybersecurity-Improvement-Act-now-law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article about the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act</a>, which was signed into law in the United States on December 4 2020, and seeks to ensure that the U.S. government only buys secure devices and remediates known vulnerabilities in existing devices. In this interview, he advocated for meaningful and advanced technical standards for IoT security to be put forward by NIST, beyond those that were introduced as a result of the existing, consumer-oriented California SB-327 and Oregon HB2395 laws, which only implemented baseline controls, primarily in response to the Mirai botnet.</li></ul>



<p>From a <strong>consumer</strong> perspective, we published a number of technical findings across a range of consumer IoT devices including IP cameras, smart doorbells, and personal IoT gateways, as well as offered several technical presentations.</p>



<ul><li>In February 2020, Jason Kielpinski published <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/02/10/interfaces-d-to-rce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Interfaces.d to RCE</a>, in which he discusses some research into the Mozilla WebThings IoT gateway, which is a gateway essentially allows a user to host their own IoT cloud from a device (such as a Raspberry Pi) on their local network, creating a tunnel to a personal subdomain of mozilla-iot.org for managing a user’s devices from the internet. In this post, he discussed his general excitement about users being able to self-manage their IoT devices, but also revealed input validation issues on the device which led to not only data injection, but code injection too! He noted that by inserting one of these event hooks into the file, it’s possible to get command execution, and that since these scripts must run as root in order to be able to manipulate the network settings, this leads to a complete compromise of the affected gateway. Fortunately, when we reported the vulnerability to Mozilla, they implemented a fix and automatically applied it to all affected devices the very next day.</li><li>In July 2020, Dale Pavey published <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/07/31/lights-camera-hacked-an-insight-into-the-world-of-popular-ip-cameras/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lights, Camera, HACKED!

In this paper, we outlined the current state of the Connected Health landscape, discussed a range of key themes, outlined existing standards and regulation for connected health, and offered future-thinking research directions related to the security implications of the inevitable convergence between connected health and both artificial intelligence and ambient computing.<br><br>This year, our interest in connected health evolved to include building substantial research testbeds and exploring a number of protocols and standards within health informatics.</p>



<ul><li>This year, Stuart Kurutac built out the first phase of our internal Connected Medical Research Labs, which will ultimately facilitate critical research and testing in a complex, clinically-inspired environment that eliminates the risk of patient harm. The implementations within the labs include HL7 v2 (clinical messaging standard) interfaces, an EMR (Electronic Medical Record &#8211; patient data) with an associated database, 2 DICOM (medical imaging) servers and an integration engine, with a continually growing set of additional integrated components. He has also focussed on generating test data and the development and/or integration of multiple security testing tools for connected health environments, and has been developing broad testing capabilities across these environments.&nbsp;</li><li>Stuart also led a project that resulted in a number of vulnerabilities in open source medical applications being discovered and reported.</li><li>In May 2020, we also discussed supply chain security in healthcare environments with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.darkreading.com/security-monitoring.asp" target="_blank">Dark Reading</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>In September 2020, Stuart Kurutac presented some of his connected health research with CENSIS (Scotland&#8217;s Innovation Centre for sensing, imaging and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies), at their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://censis.org.uk/2020/08/13/iot-cyber-challenge-programme-olaunch/" target="_blank">IoT Cyber Challenge Program Launch</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>We have been seeking to more closely demonstrate <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/nccgroup/news/the-link-between-patient-safety-and-cyber-security-405009" target="_blank">the link between patient safety and cybersecurity</a>, discussed in this introductory blog post.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>In December 2020, Stuart Kurutac published, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newsroom.nccgroup.com/documents/ncc-group-the-patient-safety-impact-of-network-infrastructure-vulnerabilities-whitepaper-101887" target="_blank">The patient safety impact of network infrastructure vulnerabilities</a>,” in partnership with external collaborators from The AbedGraham Group. This high-level whitepaper, written for healthcare IT decision-makers, discusses the use of IoT systems in healthcare settings, and explores some specific potential use cases. In this work, they advocate for hospital IT leaders to pay greater attention to clinical network infrastructure &#8211; particular for mission-critical communications and services, emphasizing that patient safety risk is no longer primarily the domain of connected medical devices.</li></ul>

<ul><li>In June 2020, Andy Davis published a research paper titled,”<a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/03/cyber-security-of-new-space-paper/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyber Security of New Space</a>” in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10207-020-00503-w.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Journal of Information Security</a> with collaborators from the <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/surrey-centre-cyber-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Surrey Center for Cyber Security</a> and <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/surrey-space-centre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Surrey Space Center</a>. This paper analysed past satellite security threats and incidents to assess the motivations and characteristics of adversarial threats to satellites, finding that ground and radio frequency communications were the most favoured targets, but that the boom of satellite constellations in the upcoming years may shift this focus towards the space segment whose security must be addressed by future work in research and in the industry. They also discussed emerging security challenges and key technologies which are advancing and innovating the space and satellite industry, offering a roadmap toward securing the satellite industry.<br></li></ul>

<h3 id="ICS">SCADA, ICS, and the Industrial Internet&nbsp;</h3>



<ul><li>For the purposes of experimentation, we created a “Nuclear Reactor on a Bench” research platform, to simulate critical connected systems within nuclear facilities to create a safe hardware testbed in which to explore cybersecurity risks in connected energy environments. This work, conducted by Barden Winkle, involved building an initial SCADA research platform using a number of different PLC manufacturers based on a real world application including HMIs. The main component manufacturers include Siemens, Schneider Electric, OMRON, Allen-Bradley, ABB and Mitsubishi (drive controller), and the platform makes use of standard industrial protocols for further research (i.e. ProfiNet, MODBUS, EtherNet/IP, etc), and provides a platform to write detailed testing methodologies.</li></ul>

<h2 id="ReducingVulnerabilities">Reducing Vulnerabilities at Scale</h2>



<p>We recognize that our industry requires scalable methods to prevent, detect, and mitigate vulnerabilities. Our research this year has included a multidisciplinary approach to this problem, including work into integrating security into devops workflows and creating tooling to support agile delivery of more-secure production software, alongside programming languages research and standards development to prevent specific bug classes, the study and experimentation of new tooling and program analysis techniques, as well as considerable effort to create a more comprehensive threat model for the open source ecosystem, and identify scalable opportunities to offer indicators of security risk, help prioritize high-value pieces of internet infrastructure upon which there are a high number of transitive dependencies, and continued experimentation and development of tooling to identify vulnerabilities in source code and software binaries.&nbsp;</p>

Below, we discuss a number of publications by RIFT, including on pandemic-related threat intelligence, our dissection and early reporting of the WastedLocker ransomware, the noted exploitation of Citrix’s ADC vulnerabilities, and our in-the-wild observations about the remote code execution vulnerability in the F5 Big-IP administrative interface (CVE-2020-5902, disclosed July 2020), among other things including a profile of the threat actor commonly known as TA505.</p>



<ul><li>In the third week of March 2020, we published a piece on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/03/19/threat-actors-exploiting-the-pandemic/" target="_blank">our observation of global cyber-threat actors’ early attempts to attempting to capitalize on current events and global anxiety related to the escalating pandemic.</a> Ultimately, we found that there was not an increase of threat actors, the tactics of threat actors were changing, with many campaigns starting to leverage user interest in COVID-19 information as a means to distribute malware.&nbsp;</li><li>In April 2020, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/04/04/ieft_draft_indicators_of_compromise/" target="_blank">we blogged about our recent IETF draft</a> (co-written with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/" target="_blank">UK National Cyber Security Center</a>), titled “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-paine-smart-indicators-of-compromise/?include_text=1" target="_blank">Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and Their Role in Attack Defence</a>”. This article provides a draft that will help converge on the formalization as well as the definition, role, and value of indicators of compromise (IoCs), and “outlines the different types of IoC, their associated benefits and limitations, and discusses their effective use. It also contextualises the role of IoCs in defending against attacks through describing a recent case study.”</li><li>In early June 2020, we wrote an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/02/in-depth-analysis-of-the-new-team9-malware-family/" target="_blank">in-depth analysis of the new Team9 malware family</a>. Team9 is a new piece of malware that is being developed by the same group that created Trickbot. Researchers have already evaluated two main components of the malware thus far, the loader and the backdoor, and discuss details in the associated blog post.</li><li>In June 2020, Nikolaos Pantazopoulos, Stefano Antenucci, and Michael Sandee &#8211; in close collaboration with NCC’s RIFT &#8211; published <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/23/wastedlocker-a-new-ransomware-variant-developed-by-the-evil-corp-group/" target="_blank">WastedLocker: A New Ransomware Variant Developed By The Evil Corp Group</a>. This post discusses a new ransomware variant called “WastedLocker” which begun popping up in May of 2020. It is believed to have been created by the Evil Corp Group, perhaps best previously known due to their association with <em>Dridex</em> malware and <em>BitPaymer</em> ransomware. The ransomware is distributed via the SocGholish fake update framework, and it is used to distribute a custom Cobalt Strike loader. WastedLocker is a sophisticated piece of malware protected by a custom crypter referred to as CryptOne and will perform self-checks to ensure that the ransomware will run properly. In this post, we discuss the known history of Evil Corp, and offer technical analysis of WastedLocker, as well as some IoCs for research purposes, alongside an explanation about why IoCs for targeted ransomware have limited utility in defense, due to the bespoke nature of the build configurations per victim.

This vulnerability went from disclosure to active, in-the-wild exploitation within less than 4 days, the timeline of which is enumerated in our post, which served as a summary of what the RIFT team knew as the situation unfolded. These consequences resulted from the July 7th disclosure by Citrix of a number of vulnerabilities in the application delivery controller (CVE-2020-8193, CVE-2020-8195, CVE-2020-8196). As of July 10th, RIFT has confirmed that the vulnerability reported and exploited by Donny Maasland on July 8th can be used to extract valid VPN sessions from a vulnerable instance.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<ul><li>On July 5th 2020, we published some of <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/07/05/rift-f5-networks-k52145254-tmui-rce-vulnerability-cve-2020-5902-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our initial analysis of the F5 Networks K52145254: TMUI RCE vulnerability (CVE-2020-5902)</a>. CVE-2020-5902 was disclosed on July 1st, 2020 by F5 Networks in K52145254 as a CVSS 10.0 remote code execution vulnerability in the Big-IP administrative interface, ultimately allowing arbitrary, active interception of any traffic traversing an internet-exposed, unpatched Big-IP node. By July 3rd, 2020 NCC Group observed active exploitation. NCC Group’s RIFT observed that the REST API was being used to execute code. On July 14th, 2020 we noticed that the threat actors were starting to deploy more complex payloads and miners. As time went on threat actors started using staged exploitation, web shells, and were able to bypass mitigation attempts. The exploitation of this vulnerability provided the opportunity for threat actors to gain credentials, license keys, and private keys to any SSL/TLS certificates on these load balancing devices. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/f5-big-ip-networking-vulnerability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired initially reported on this research in their July 6th article, Hackers Are Exploiting a 5-Alarm Bug in Networking Equipment</a>. In this piece, they discussed the spike in RCE attempts we noticed against our honeypots exposing these vulnerabilities on the Sunday of the July 4th weekend, as well as into Monday. This further supports US CISA director Chris Krebs’ July 5th tweet, “If you didn’t patch by this morning, assume compromised”.

In this data, we observed that the threat actors exploited the vulnerable devices and did things like password dumps, the creation of multiple backdoors, the collection of various sensitive files, and deployment of bitcoin miners and botnet loaders, and emphasized the particular time-sensitivity of patching the F5 vulnerability to resist adversarial compromise of affected devices.</li><li>In November 2020, we published <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/11/18/ta505-a-brief-history-of-their-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a profile on the cyber-threat actor known as TA505</a>, a sophisticated, self-subsisting, threat actor who has engaged in multiple targets across multiple sectors for financial gain. TA505’s simple but effective attack strategy is to&nbsp; “encrypt a corporate network with ransomware, more specifically the Clop ransomware strain, and demand a ransom in Bitcoin to obtain the decryption key.” The group was able to succeed by utilizing a GetandGo-SDBbot campaign, consisting of a simple loader that gathered system information, beaconing, and command execution. We discuss how TA505 was able to stay under the radar for long periods of time, as well as qualities observed related to their working hours and other signatures of their attack methods.<br></li></ul>

<h2 id="EDG">Exploit Development Group</h2>



<p>NCC Group’s Exploit Development Group (EDG) is a small team of full-time exploit developers who write custom exploits exclusively for the purpose of helping our clients test their own infrastructure and systems against real-world attacks of contemporary vulnerabilities and exploits in the wild, to better understand their risk and resilience. This team reports into Group CTO, Ollie Whitehouse. Sometimes, this team presents some of their research externally, and occasionally will speak publicly about consensual, proof-of-concept exploitation of vulnerabilities on our clients’ infrastructure, such as in our recent discussion of <a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/nccgroup/news/running-the-risk-how-we-unleased-our-version-of-notpetya-on-global-commodities-trading-firm-trafigura-392069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how in 2017, we unleashed our version of NotPetya on global commodities trading firm, Trafigura</a>.</p>

This work looks at some of the communication and encryption internals of Cobalt Strike between Beacons and the Team Server in the 3.5 family, then exploring the subsequent exploitation of a vulnerability in Cobalt Strike 3.5 from 2016 to achieve remote unauthenticated code execution on the Team Server. We chose this type of archaeological bug hunting to illustrate to blue teams the encryption fundamentals underpinning Cobalt Strike, as well as to give some insight into detection engineering. For red teams, the exploitation of this vulnerability emphasizes the importance of hardening command and control infrastructure.&nbsp;</li><li>Throughout the year, EDG published a series of blog posts on CVE-2018-8611 Exploiting Windows KTM. This five-post series <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/04/27/cve-2018-8611-exploiting-windows-ktm-part-1-5-introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced CVE-2018-8611</a> and provided background information about the Windows Kernel Transaction Manager (KTM), performed <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/05/04/cve-2018-8611-exploiting-windows-ktm-part-2-5-patch-analysis-and-basic-triggering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch analysis and basic triggering</a> of the vulnerability with an assisted race condition, <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/05/11/cve-2018-8611-exploiting-windows-ktm-part-3-5-triggering-the-race-condition-and-debugging-tricks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed triggering the race condition, and outlined some debugging tricks</a>, and <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/05/18/cve-2018-8611-exploiting-windows-ktm-part-4-5-from-race-win-to-kernel-read-and-write-primitive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outlined how to then build an arbitrary read/write primitive that leads us to privilege escalation</a> and presented a demo showing exploitation on an unpatched Windows 10 1809 x64 from approximately October 2018.
