This mandatory policy has become one of the most important mechanisms in the iOS security ecosystem to ensure the privacy and security of iOS users. But we recently identified an app that demonstrated new ways of successfully evading Apple\u2019s code review. This post discusses our findings and potential security risks to iOS device users.\n\nThe app we identified is named \u201c\u5f00\u5fc3\u65e5\u5e38\u82f1\u8bed (Happy Daily English),\u201d and it has since been removed by Apple from the App Store. This app was a complex, fully functional third party App Store client for iOS users in mainland China. We also discovered enterprise signed versions of this application elsewhere in the wild. We had not identified any malicious functionality in this app, and as such we classified it as Riskware and have named it ZergHelper.\n\nFigure 1: \"Happy Daily English\" available in the App Store\nZergHelper presents several security risks, include the following:\n\n\tIt provides installation of modified versions of iOS apps whose security can\u2019t be ensured..\n\tIt abuses enterprises certificate and personal certificates to sign and distribute apps, which may include code that hasn\u2019t been reviewed, or abuse private APIs.\n\tIt asks user to input an Apple ID while it also shares some Apple IDs to users. It will log in to an Apple server using these IDs to perform many operations in background.\n\tIts author is trying to extend its capabilities via dynamic updating of its code, which could further bypass iOS security restrictions.\n\tIt uses some novel techniques that are sensitive and risky \u2013 techniques that could be used by other malware to attack the iOS ecosystem.\n\nZergHelper appears to have gotten by Apple\u2019s app review process by performing different behaviors for users from different physical locations on earth. For users outside of China, it would act as what it claimed: an English studying app. However, when accessing the app from China, its real features would appear.\n\nThe app was made available in the App Store on October 30, 2015. However, nobody appeared to have noticed ZergHelper\u2019s hidden functionality until February 19, 2016, when a user created a post in V2EX (a Chinese developer forum) to discuss it. We shared our findings with Apple on February 19, and Apple removed the app from the App Store later that day.\n\nZergHelper\u2019s main functionality appeared to be to provide another App Store that includes pirated and cracked iOS apps and games. The app was developed by a company in China that named its main product \u201cXY Helper\u201d. ZergHelper was the non-jailbroken and \u201cofficial App Store\u201d version of this product.\n\nIn addition to its abuse of enterprise certificates, this riskware used some new and novel approaches to install apps on non-jailbroken devices. It re-implemented a tiny version of Apple\u2019s iTunes client for Windows to login, purchase and download apps. It also implemented some functionalities of Apple\u2019s Xcode IDE to automatically generate free personal development certificates from Apple\u2019s server to sign apps in the iOS devices \u2013 which means the attacker has analyzed Apple\u2019s proprietary protocols and abused the new developer program introduced eight months ago. ZergHelper also shares some valid Apple IDs with users so that they don\u2019t need to use their own IDs.\n\nZergHelper\u2019s code is complex and it\u2019s still unclear whether it would steal account information and send it back to server or not. The app did send some device information automatically to a server for statistic tracking. The authors appeared to be trying to use the programming language Lua to make the app more extensible. Specifically, ZergHelper\u2019s use of the framework means its code could be remotely updated without Apple\u2019s further review.\n\nWe also identified over 50 ZergHelper apps that are signed by enterprise certificates. These apps were spread by authors in different channels.\nZergHelper\u2019s Spreading and Functionality\nZergHelper was designed to be installed in this way: if an iOS user accessed XY Helper\u2019s official website from China, the top advertisement banner would prompt a page saying that you could go to App Store to install their product \u201cXY Apple Helper\u201d (left of Figure 2). By clicking the button, the official App Store is automatically opened and the \u201cHappy Daily English\u201d app\u2019s page is shown (right of Figure 2).\n\nThe original \u201cHappy Daily English\u201d app is open-sourced and hosted on OSChina as a project named \u201cHappyEnglishSentences8k\u201d. ZergHelper authors compiled it and embedded their own risky code. There appear to have been at least three people jointly developing it using the usernames of \u201cxi\u201d, \u201czhang\u201d and \u201czhangzq\u201d. The project\u2019s internal name was XYFactory and the app\u2019s internal name was \u201cAppStore_4.0.1\u201d.\n\nFigure 2: Official website guides user to download ZergHelper from App Store\nIf you were to browse the app using the desktop browser or by iTunes client on any platform, the app\u2019s name would be shown as \u201c\u5f00\u5fc3\u65e5\u5e38\u82f1\u8bed (Happy Daily English)\u201d. However, once it was installed on an iPhone or iPad, the name became \u201cXY\u52a9\u624b (XY Helper)\u201d with the same logo, just like the value of CFBundleDisplayName in the app\u2019s Info.plist file (Figure 3). Our analysis suggests the authors inputted a different name when submitting the app to Apple through web form and Apple\u2019s review process didn\u2019t identify that inconsistency.\n\nFigure 3: The app's name is inconsistent with iTunes page\nWhen the app launched, it would connect to the URL interface[.]xyzs.com immediately, and take different reactions based on result of the HTTP request (Figure 4). The webpage was configured to return a 404-not-found error if the access comes from an IP address outside of mainland China. In this situation, the app would only display an English study interface (left of Figure 5) \u2013 no other functionality was provided to users in these regions.\n\nFigure 4: The app provices different functionality based on HTTP request result\n\nFigure 5: Different interfaces will be showed for users from different locations\nWe don\u2019t know where the App Store reviewers are located. If they are not located in mainland China, this method could trick them into seeing a legitimate app. Even if they\u2019re in China, the author could just shut down that webpage during the review period so that reviewer could not see the actual functionality through an analysis of its behavior.\n\nFor users in China, the different user interfaces would appear (right of Figure 5). Then the app will guide to install two configuration profiles that it claims are for \u201cresolving stability issues\u201d but will actually install a device enrollment challenge and a web clip (Figure 6). These profiles were signed with a certificate of \u201cxyzs.com\u201d which was issued by Go Daddy Secure Certificate Authority on December 2, 2015. Note that the device enrollment challenge is used to enroll the device to related MDM (Mobile Device Management) system.\n\nFigure 6: The app asks to install two profiles signed by certificate issued by GoDaddy\nThe app provided functionality of directly installing plenty of iOS apps and games to the device. It has pages for hot apps, hot games, top grossing apps, etc., just like the official App Store (Figure 7). The only difference is, all apps or games provided by ZergHelper are free, which means, they are likely pirated versions of the legitimate apps.\n\nFigure 7: Main user interfaces\nIn the settings tab, for devices using pre-9.0 versions of iOS, a user could also input an Apple ID and password. The password would be remembered by the app. There\u2019s another button used for \u201cI don\u2019t have an Apple ID. I would like to receive one for free\u201d (Figure 8). We have not identified where these Apple IDs came from.\n\nFigure 8: \u201cI don\u2019t have an Apple ID. I would like to receive one for free\u201d\n\nNovel Approach to Act as 3rd-party App Store on Non-jailbroken Devices\nZergHelper used unique ways to build a third-party App Store for non-jailbroken iOS devices. Each of them could be used to spread pirated or cracked iOS apps. Two of them are new methods of getting past App Store review that we haven\u2019t previously observed.\nFake as Tiny iTunes Client\nZergHelper implemented the protocols between the iTunes client for PC and Apple\u2019s App Store servers. To be more specific, these functionalities have been implemented in the app:\n\n\tLog into the App Store, cache authentication data, and log out of the account\n\tClick the term of service\n\tGet an app\u2019s information\n\tPurchase an app (Figure 9)\n\tDownload the purchased app\n\nWhen communicating with Apple\u2019s server, ZergHelper used a User Agent like this:\n\n\tiTunes\/12.0.1 (Windows; Microsoft Windows 7 x64 Business Edition iTunes\/12.0.1 (Windows; Microsoft Windows 7 x64 Business Edition\n\nHence the app is trying to act as an iTunes 12.0.1 client running on Windows 7 system.\n\nFigure 9: Code to purchase an app by simulating the iTunes protocol\nWe\u2019re still not very clear in which ways ZergHelper used these functionalities. It\u2019s possible that they were used for the Apple ID given by users, or by the \u201cfree\u201d Apple ID provided by the app itself.\nSimulate Xcode to Apply Personal Development Certificate\nThe most surprising approach to installing apps on non-jailbroken devices is how ZergHelper abused free personal development certificates.\n\nPreviously, Apple only offered iOS development certificates for registered developers who paid an annual fee. This kind of certificate is necessary for anyone to sign an app and then run it on a physical device. From June 2015, Apple began to provide a new program that allows anyone with an Apple ID to receive a certificate for free. The functionality is embedded into Xcode since its 7.0 version and so far Xcode is the only official way to use this feature.\n\nHowever, ZergHelper could have acted as Xcode to receive a valid personal development certificate from Apple's authentication servers, too. Apple doesn\u2019t disclose how this process works and how Xcode is implemented. Therefore, we think someone has reverse-engineered Xcode in detail to analyze this part of code so that they can implement exactly the same behaviors with Xcode \u2013 in effect, successfully cheating Apple's server.\n\nFigure 10: Login to Apple's server\n\nFigure 11: Fetch development certificate\nUsing the development certificate, ZergHelper could sign other iOS apps on iOS devices and then install them. There are limits on the number of iOS devices that can be authorized to use each certificate. Previously, people worried about whether the free certificates would be abused by someone to install pirated apps, but this technique shows abuse in a wide-ranging and automated way.\n\nIn the same week that we were analyzing ZergHelper, we observed someone selling source code that:\n\n\tAutomatically registers for Apple IDs by reversing protocols in phone and in PC\n\tOffers app DRM authentication from PC for \u201chelper utilities\u201d\n\tAutomatically generates a personal development certificate by an Apple ID\n\nThe information was posted on a famous security forum in China in February 19, and was then deleted on February 20.\n\nFigure 12: The deleted post of selling related source code (screenshot)\n\nAuthorize Pirated Apps from PC\nFor some pirated apps downloaded from ZergHelper\u2019s server, the app asks the user to connect the iPhone or iPad to a PC for \u201cauthentication\u201d with the help of the XY Helper\u2019s Windows version. We have not reverse-engineered the Windows client. As far as we know, the purpose behind this is to implement the Windows client like an iTunes and to trick the iOS device into believing an iOS app has been authorized through the PC. (This attack technique has been in use with some tools for years.)\nAbusing Enterprise Certificates\nZergHelper also abused enterprise certificates in a manner similar to other previously identified iOS malware, including WireLurker, YiSpecter and TinyV. In the app, these kinds of apps are tagged with \u201cinstall in a second.\u201d ZergHelper used the itms-service protocol for these apps\u2019 installation. Compared with previous malware, the main difference in ZergHelper is that it would not only download itms-service plist file from C2 server, but it could also open a local port to install some apps onsite. This feature may have been designed for apps signed by personal certificates.\n\nFigure 13: Enterprise signed apps's PLIST files were hosted either on remote server or the local device\n\nMore ZergHelper Samples in the Wild\nApple\u2019s App Store was just one \u201cchannel\u201d through which ZergHelper was distributed. The authors also developed other versions that are all signed by different enterprise certificates. These versions were distributed through different channels and could be installed to non-jailbroken devices. For example, when you access XY Helper\u2019s website, you could choose to install it from the App Store or directly from their server.\n\nWe found over 50 ZergHelper samples signed by nine different enterprise certificates. In their \u201cxyChannelId.plist\u201d files, the author specified 32 different channel IDs and 33 different channel names.\n\nFigure 14: One of enterprise certificates being used to sign ZergHelper\n\nPotential Security Risks\nApple\u2019s Code Review\nPreviously there have been some malware (e.g., FindAndCall) or Proof-of-Concept apps (e.g., Jekyll) that successfully made it into the official App Store. The most recent cases are XcodeGhost and InstaAgent. Compared with those, ZergHelper has more user interfaces and more significantly suspicious code characteristics. Apple typically doesn\u2019t disclose any technical details regarding how its reviewers check apps to confirm they are not malicious. But ZergHelper demonstrates new techniques that can evade Apple reviewer scrutiny.\nEnterprise Certificate\nSince WireLurker, there have been more malware or evasive applications installed on iOS by abusing enterprise certificate. The biggest risk around this issue is the combination of enterprise certificate and private APIs. YiSpecter and Youmi have abused private APIs to collect private information on iOS. ZergHelper took another step to automatically generate development certificates for free. This is of concern because the abuse of these certificates may be the first step toward future attacks.\nApple ID\nIn the underground market for iOS tools, Apple IDs have become more and more important. In recent months, we\u2019ve seen malware designed to steal Apple IDs (e.g., KeyRaider), take money from them (e.g., AppBuyer) and share them (e.g., YiSpecter). Some attackers ransom the stolen Apple IDs or phish for them. ZergHelper\u2019s functionality also relied on valid Apple IDs. We\u2019re still not certain whether ZergHelper could send stolen Apple IDs back to its server or not. Note that ZergHelper would provide free Apple IDs to its users, and we do not know from where these IDs originated. Use of Apple IDs only continues to grow, especially when we consider the amount of private data stored in iCloud and on iPhones and iPads.\nCode Dynamic Loading\nApple requires every single update to an app in the App Store to be reviewed again before publishing. For ZergHelper, re-review increases the possibility of exposure. The authors appear to have tried to resolve this problem by using a scripting language.\n\nZergHelper used an open source project called wax, \u201ca framework that lets you write native iPhone apps in Lua.\u201d In the app, there\u2019s a XYLib.lua file that only contains two functions so far. This Lua plugin will be loaded and executed when the app first launches. Through the wax library, this script could invoke many methods in the Objective-C runtime.\nFigure 15: Lua plugin in ZergHelper\nApple disallows iOS app from dynamically loading new code or dynamically updating themselves. This is an important and useful security mechanism to mitigate the risk of some kinds of vulnerabilities and some malware. However, frameworks or SDKs like wax provide another way to bypass the restriction.\n\nDynamic code loading is a classic method used by malware to hide an author\u2019s true intentions. In the last few years popular iOS SDKs that provide JavaScript, Lua or other script languages\u2019 interface to Objective-C runtime have emerged. Considering how easy it is to write code in these languages, and how hard it is to analyze or to detect them, we think this approach may be adopted by more malware or PUAs in every popular platform (for example, the Android Trojan Xbot we recently revealed used JavaScript to implement part of its core functionality.)\nMitigation\nWe reported the issue to Apple on February 19 and Apple removed the app from the App Store on February 20.\n\nFor iOS users that have installed \u201c\u5f00\u5fc3\u65e5\u5e38\u82f1\u8bed\u201d from App Store, or found \u201cXY\u52a9\u624b\u201d in your devices, we suggest you uninstall it. We also suggest that users check profiles in their iOS devices (by Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Profiles &amp; Device Management).

This mandatory policy has become one of the most important mechanisms in the iOS security ecosystem to ensure the privacy and security of iOS users. But we recently identified an app that demonstrated new ways of successfully evading Apple’s code review. This post discusses our findings and potential security risks to iOS device users.</p>
<p>The app we identified is named “开心日常英语 (Happy Daily English),” and it has since been removed by Apple from the App Store. This app was a complex, fully functional third party App Store client for iOS users in mainland China. We also discovered enterprise signed versions of this application elsewhere in the wild. We had not identified any malicious functionality in this app, and as such we classified it as Riskware and have named it ZergHelper.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12304" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig1-500x383.png" alt="Fig1" width="500" height="383" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 1: &#8220;Happy Daily English&#8221; available in the App Store</em></p>
<p>ZergHelper presents several security risks, include the following:<span id="more-12289"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>It provides installation of modified versions of iOS apps whose security can’t be ensured..</li>
<li>It abuses enterprises certificate and personal certificates to sign and distribute apps, which may include code that hasn’t been reviewed, or abuse private APIs.</li>
<li>It asks user to input an Apple ID while it also shares some Apple IDs to users. It will log in to an Apple server using these IDs to perform many operations in background.</li>
<li>Its author is trying to extend its capabilities via dynamic updating of its code, which could further bypass iOS security restrictions.</li>
<li>It uses some novel techniques that are sensitive and risky – techniques that could be used by other malware to attack the iOS ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>ZergHelper appears to have gotten by Apple’s app review process by performing different behaviors for users from different physical locations on earth. For users outside of China, it would act as what it claimed: an English studying app. However, when accessing the app from China, its real features would appear.</p>
<p>The app was made available in the App Store on October 30, 2015. However, nobody appeared to have noticed ZergHelper’s hidden functionality until February 19, 2016, when a user <a href="http://v2ex.com/t/257767">created a post in V2EX</a> (a Chinese developer forum) to discuss it. We shared our findings with Apple on February 19, and Apple removed the app from the App Store later that day.</p>
<p>ZergHelper’s main functionality appeared to be to provide another App Store that includes pirated and cracked iOS apps and games. The app was developed by a company in China that named its main product “XY Helper”. ZergHelper was the non-jailbroken and “official App Store” version of this product.</p>
<p>In addition to its abuse of enterprise certificates, this riskware used some new and novel approaches to install apps on non-jailbroken devices. It re-implemented a tiny version of Apple’s iTunes client for Windows to login, purchase and download apps. It also implemented some functionalities of Apple’s Xcode IDE to automatically generate free personal development certificates from Apple’s server to sign apps in the iOS devices – which means the attacker has analyzed Apple’s proprietary protocols and abused the new developer program introduced eight months ago. ZergHelper also shares some valid Apple IDs with users so that they don’t need to use their own IDs.</p>
<p>ZergHelper’s code is complex and it’s still unclear whether it would steal account information and send it back to server or not. The app did send some device information automatically to a server for statistic tracking. The authors appeared to be trying to use the programming language Lua to make the app more extensible. Specifically, ZergHelper’s use of the framework means its code could be remotely updated without Apple’s further review.</p>
<p>We also identified over 50 ZergHelper apps that are signed by enterprise certificates. These apps were spread by authors in different channels.</p>
<h1>ZergHelper’s Spreading and Functionality</h1>
<p>ZergHelper was designed to be installed in this way: if an iOS user accessed XY Helper’s official website from China, the top advertisement banner would prompt a page saying that you could go to App Store to install their product “XY Apple Helper” (left of Figure 2). By clicking the button, the official App Store is automatically opened and the “Happy Daily English” app’s page is shown (right of Figure 2).</p>
<p>The original “Happy Daily English” app is open-sourced and hosted on <a href="http://git.oschina.net/BlockCheng/HappyEnglishSentences8k">OSChina</a> as a project named “HappyEnglishSentences8k”. ZergHelper authors compiled it and embedded their own risky code. There appear to have been at least three people jointly developing it using the usernames of “xi”, “zhang” and “zhangzq”. The project’s internal name was XYFactory and the app’s internal name was “AppStore_4.0.1”.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12303" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig2-500x431.png" alt="Fig2" width="500" height="431" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 2: Official website guides user to download ZergHelper from App Store</em></p>
<p>If you were to browse the app using the desktop browser or by iTunes client on any platform, the app’s name would be shown as “开心日常英语 (Happy Daily English)”. However, once it was installed on an iPhone or iPad, the name became “XY助手 (XY Helper)” with the same logo, just like the value of CFBundleDisplayName in the app’s Info.plist file (Figure 3). Our analysis suggests the authors inputted a different name when submitting the app to Apple through web form and Apple’s review process didn’t identify that inconsistency.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12302" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig3-500x86.png" alt="Fig3" width="500" height="86" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 3: The app&#8217;s name is inconsistent with iTunes page</em></p>
<p>When the app launched, it would connect to the URL interface[.]xyzs.com immediately, and take different reactions based on result of the HTTP request (Figure 4). The webpage was configured to return a 404-not-found error if the access comes from an IP address outside of mainland China. In this situation, the app would only display an English study interface (left of Figure 5) – no other functionality was provided to users in these regions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12301" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig4-500x244.png" alt="Fig4" width="500" height="244" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 4: The app provices different functionality based on HTTP request result</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12300" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig5-500x434.png" alt="Fig5" width="500" height="434" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 5: Different interfaces will be showed for users from different locations</em></p>
<p>We don’t know where the App Store reviewers are located. If they are not located in mainland China, this method could trick them into seeing a legitimate app. Even if they’re in China, the author could just shut down that webpage during the review period so that reviewer could not see the actual functionality through an analysis of its behavior.</p>
<p>For users in China, the different user interfaces would appear (right of Figure 5). Then the app will guide to install two configuration profiles that it claims are for “resolving stability issues” but will actually install a device enrollment challenge and a web clip (Figure 6). These profiles were signed with a certificate of “xyzs.com” which was issued by Go Daddy Secure Certificate Authority on December 2, 2015. Note that the device enrollment challenge is used to enroll the device to related MDM (Mobile Device Management) system.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12299" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig6-500x182.png" alt="Fig6" width="500" height="182" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 6: The app asks to install two profiles signed by certificate issued by GoDaddy</em></p>
<p>The app provided functionality of directly installing plenty of iOS apps and games to the device. It has pages for hot apps, hot games, top grossing apps, etc., just like the official App Store (Figure 7). The only difference is, all apps or games provided by ZergHelper are free, which means, they are likely pirated versions of the legitimate apps.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12298" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig7-500x432.png" alt="Fig7" width="500" height="432" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 7: Main user interfaces</em></p>
<p>In the settings tab, for devices using pre-9.0 versions of iOS, a user could also input an Apple ID and password. The password would be remembered by the app. There’s another button used for “I don’t have an Apple ID. I would like to receive one for free” (Figure 8). We have not identified where these Apple IDs came from.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12297" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig8.png" alt="Fig8" width="487" height="507" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig8.png 487w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig8-288x300.png 288w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig8-370x385.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 8: “I don’t have an Apple ID. I would like to receive one for free”</em></p>
<h1>Novel Approach to Act as 3<sup>rd</sup>-party App Store on Non-jailbroken Devices</h1>
<p>ZergHelper used unique ways to build a third-party App Store for non-jailbroken iOS devices. Each of them could be used to spread pirated or cracked iOS apps. Two of them are new methods of getting past App Store review that we haven’t previously observed.</p>
<h2>Fake as Tiny iTunes Client</h2>
<p>ZergHelper implemented the protocols between the iTunes client for PC and Apple’s App Store servers. To be more specific, these functionalities have been implemented in the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log into the App Store, cache authentication data, and log out of the account</li>
<li>Click the term of service</li>
<li>Get an app’s information</li>
<li>Purchase an app (Figure 9)</li>
<li>Download the purchased app</li>
</ul>
<p>When communicating with Apple’s server, ZergHelper used a User Agent like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>iTunes/12.0.1 (Windows; Microsoft Windows 7 x64 Business Edition iTunes/12.0.1 (Windows; Microsoft Windows 7 x64 Business Edition</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence the app is trying to act as an iTunes 12.0.1 client running on Windows 7 system.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12296" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig9-500x154.png" alt="Fig9" width="500" height="154" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 9: Code to purchase an app by simulating the iTunes protocol</em></p>
<p>We’re still not very clear in which ways ZergHelper used these functionalities. It’s possible that they were used for the Apple ID given by users, or by the “free” Apple ID provided by the app itself.</p>
<h2>Simulate Xcode to Apply Personal Development Certificate</h2>
<p>The most surprising approach to installing apps on non-jailbroken devices is how ZergHelper abused free personal development certificates.</p>
<p>Previously, Apple only offered iOS development certificates for registered developers who paid an annual fee. This kind of certificate is necessary for anyone to sign an app and then run it on a physical device. From June 2015, <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/06/10/xcode-7-allows-anyone-to-download-build-and-sideload-ios-apps-for-free/">Apple began to provide a new program</a> that allows anyone with an Apple ID to receive a certificate for free. The functionality is embedded into Xcode since its 7.0 version and so far Xcode is the only official way to use this feature.</p>
<p>However, ZergHelper could have acted as Xcode to receive a valid personal development certificate from Apple&#8217;s authentication servers, too. Apple doesn’t disclose how this process works and how Xcode is implemented. Therefore, we think someone has reverse-engineered Xcode in detail to analyze this part of code so that they can implement exactly the same behaviors with Xcode – in effect, successfully cheating Apple&#8217;s server.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12295" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig10-500x152.png" alt="Fig10" width="500" height="152" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 10: Login to Apple&#8217;s server</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12294" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig11-500x118.png" alt="Fig11" width="500" height="118" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 11: Fetch development certificate</em></p>
<p>Using the development certificate, ZergHelper could sign other iOS apps on iOS devices and then install them. There are limits on the number of iOS devices that can be authorized to use each certificate. Previously, people worried about whether the free certificates would be abused by someone to install pirated apps, but this technique shows abuse in a wide-ranging and automated way.</p>
<p>In the same week that we were analyzing ZergHelper, we observed someone selling source code that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically registers for Apple IDs by reversing protocols in phone and in PC</li>
<li>Offers app DRM authentication from PC for “helper utilities”</li>
<li>Automatically generates a personal development certificate by an Apple ID</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://bbs.pediy.com/showthread.php?p=1416073">The information was posted</a> on a famous security forum in China in February 19, and was then deleted on February 20.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12293" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig12-500x133.png" alt="Fig12" width="500" height="133" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 12: The deleted post of selling related source code (screenshot)</em></p>
<h2>Authorize Pirated Apps from PC</h2>
<p>For some pirated apps downloaded from ZergHelper’s server, the app asks the user to connect the iPhone or iPad to a PC for “authentication” with the help of the XY Helper’s Windows version. We have not reverse-engineered the Windows client. As far as we know, the purpose behind this is to implement the Windows client like an iTunes and to trick the iOS device into believing an iOS app has been authorized through the PC. (This attack technique has been in use with some tools for years.)</p>
<h2>Abusing Enterprise Certificates</h2>
<p>ZergHelper also abused enterprise certificates in a manner similar to other previously identified iOS malware, including WireLurker, YiSpecter and TinyV. In the app, these kinds of apps are tagged with “install in a second.” ZergHelper used the itms-service protocol for these apps’ installation. Compared with previous malware, the main difference in ZergHelper is that it would not only download itms-service plist file from C2 server, but it could also open a local port to install some apps onsite. This feature may have been designed for apps signed by personal certificates.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12292" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig13-500x185.png" alt="Fig13" width="500" height="185" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 13: Enterprise signed apps&#8217;s PLIST files were hosted either on remote server or the local device</em></p>
<h1>More ZergHelper Samples in the Wild</h1>
<p>Apple’s App Store was just one “channel” through which ZergHelper was distributed. The authors also developed other versions that are all signed by different enterprise certificates. These versions were distributed through different channels and could be installed to non-jailbroken devices. For example, when you access XY Helper’s website, you could choose to install it from the App Store or directly from their server.</p>
<p>We found over 50 ZergHelper samples signed by nine different enterprise certificates. In their “xyChannelId.plist” files, the author specified 32 different channel IDs and 33 different channel names.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12291" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig14.png" alt="Fig14" width="486" height="376" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig14.png 486w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig14-300x232.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig14-370x286.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 14: One of enterprise certificates being used to sign ZergHelper</em></p>
<h1>Potential Security Risks</h1>
<h2>Apple’s Code Review</h2>
<p>Previously there have been some malware (e.g., <a href="https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/33544/find-and-call-leak-and-spam-57/">FindAndCall</a>) or Proof-of-Concept apps (e.g., <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity13/technical-sessions/presentation/wang_tielei">Jekyll</a>) that successfully made it into the official App Store. The most recent cases are <a href="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/09/novel-malware-xcodeghost-modifies-xcode-infects-apple-ios-apps-and-hits-app-store/">XcodeGhost</a> and <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2015/11/10/malicious-instaagent-instagram-app/">InstaAgent</a>. Compared with those, ZergHelper has more user interfaces and more significantly suspicious code characteristics. Apple typically doesn’t disclose any technical details regarding <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/">how its reviewers check apps</a> to confirm they are not malicious. But ZergHelper demonstrates new techniques that can evade Apple reviewer scrutiny.</p>
<h2>Enterprise Certificate</h2>
<p>Since <a href="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/11/wirelurker-new-era-os-x-ios-malware/">WireLurker</a>, there have been more malware or evasive applications installed on iOS by abusing enterprise certificate. The biggest risk around this issue is the combination of enterprise certificate and private APIs. <a href="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/10/yispecter-first-ios-malware-attacks-non-jailbroken-ios-devices-by-abusing-private-apis/">YiSpecter</a> and <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2015/10/19/apple-to-remove-hundreds-apps-youmi-sdk/">Youmi</a> have abused private APIs to collect private information on iOS. ZergHelper took another step to automatically generate development certificates for free. This is of concern because the abuse of these certificates may be the first step toward future attacks.</p>
<h2>Apple ID</h2>
<p>In the underground market for iOS tools, Apple IDs have become more and more important. In recent months, we’ve seen malware designed to steal Apple IDs (e.g., <a href="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/08/keyraider-ios-malware-steals-over-225000-apple-accounts-to-create-free-app-utopia/">KeyRaider</a>), take money from them (e.g., <a href="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/09/appbuyer-new-ios-malware-steals-apple-id-password-buy-apps/">AppBuyer</a>) and share them (e.g., <a href="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/10/yispecter-first-ios-malware-attacks-non-jailbroken-ios-devices-by-abusing-private-apis/">YiSpecter</a>). Some attackers ransom the stolen Apple IDs or phish for them. ZergHelper’s functionality also relied on valid Apple IDs. We’re still not certain whether ZergHelper could send stolen Apple IDs back to its server or not. Note that ZergHelper would provide free Apple IDs to its users, and we do not know from where these IDs originated. Use of Apple IDs only continues to grow, especially when we consider the amount of private data stored in iCloud and on iPhones and iPads.</p>
<h2>Code Dynamic Loading</h2>
<p>Apple requires every single update to an app in the App Store to be reviewed again before publishing. For ZergHelper, re-review increases the possibility of exposure. The authors appear to have tried to resolve this problem by using a scripting language.</p>
<p>ZergHelper used an open source project called <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/wax">wax</a>, “a framework that lets you write native iPhone apps in Lua.” In the app, there’s a XYLib.lua file that only contains two functions so far. This Lua plugin will be loaded and executed when the app first launches. Through the wax library, this script could invoke many methods in the Objective-C runtime.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12290" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fig15-500x174.png" alt="Fig15" width="500" height="174" /><em>Figure 15: Lua plugin in ZergHelper</em></p>
<p>Apple disallows iOS app from dynamically loading new code or dynamically updating themselves. This is an important and useful security mechanism to mitigate the risk of some kinds of vulnerabilities and some malware. However, frameworks or SDKs like wax provide another way to bypass the restriction.</p>
<p>Dynamic code loading is a classic method used by malware to hide an author’s true intentions. In the last few years popular iOS SDKs that provide JavaScript, Lua or other script languages’ interface to Objective-C runtime have emerged. Considering how easy it is to write code in these languages, and how hard it is to analyze or to detect them, we think this approach may be adopted by more malware or PUAs in every popular platform (for example, the <a href="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/02/new-android-trojan-xbot-phishes-credit-cards-and-bank-accounts-encrypts-devices-for-ransom/">Android Trojan Xbot</a> we recently revealed used JavaScript to implement part of its core functionality.)</p>
<h1>Mitigation</h1>
<p>We reported the issue to Apple on February 19 and Apple removed the app from the App Store on February 20.</p>
<p>For iOS users that have installed “开心日常英语” from App Store, or found “XY助手” in your devices, we suggest you uninstall it. We also suggest that users check profiles in their iOS devices (by Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Profiles &amp; Device Management). If there’s any profile from “xyzs.com”, you should delete it immediately.</p>
