		<h2 class="entry">New Directions in Chemical Warfare</h2>
		<p>From <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18524823.800"><i>New Scientist</i></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Pentagon considered developing a host of non-lethal chemical weapons that would disrupt discipline and morale among enemy troops, newly declassified documents reveal.</p>
<p>Most bizarre among the plans was one for the development of an &#8220;aphrodisiac&#8221; chemical weapon that would make enemy soldiers sexually irresistible to each other. Provoking widespread homosexual behaviour among troops would cause a &#8220;distasteful but completely non-lethal&#8221; blow to morale, the proposal says.</p>
<p>Other ideas included chemical weapons that attract swarms of enraged wasps or angry rats to troop positions, making them uninhabitable. Another was to develop a chemical that caused &#8220;severe and lasting halitosis&#8221;, making it easy to identify guerrillas trying to blend in with civilians. There was also the idea of making troops&#8217; skin unbearably sensitive to sunlight.</p></blockquote>
<p>Technology always gets better; it never gets worse.  There will be a time, probably in our lifetimes, when weapons like these will be real.</p>

				<p>Your closing comment drips with ironic reversal: Technology does not always get better, in many ways it does get worse.  Engineers/Chemists or their superiors can choose the ideas they wish to research and develop.  Can weapons development every be considered the moral path?</p>

				<p>This is cool. Anything to reduce the death toll is great. If I were involved in a war, I would certainly prefer having bad breath, insect infestations, or sexual dysfunction to being blown to bits.</p>

				<p>This is strange:</p>
<p>&#8220;Most bizarre among the plans was one for the development of an &#8220;aphrodisiac&#8221; chemical weapon that would make enemy soldiers sexually irresistible to each other. Provoking widespread homosexual behaviour among troops would cause a &#8220;distasteful but completely non-lethal&#8221; blow to morale, the proposal says.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, homosexuality is not present in a majority of the population.  So are they claiming that there are chemicals that will convert enemy heterosexuals into homosexuals?  Because otherwise I fail to see how it will make the behavior &#8220;wide-spread&#8221;.</p>

				<p>One of the most forgotten and unknown methods in the second world war was that the german army openend Chlorine valves along some major borders. The enemy walked into these Chlorine clouds, so they put on gasmasks. Well, then the germans army did something quite inventive: they mixed the Chlorine with a chemical causes someone to vommit. And thereby has to take of his gasmask.</p>

<p>Sexual behavior under duress may be different from one&#8217;s actual inclinations&#8230; &#8216;homosexual&#8217; behavior in prison occurs in many people not at all inclined that way in the outside world.</p>

				<p>Just read up on Alexander Shulgin&#8217;s work and the history of some of the chemicals he&#8217;s worked with. I&#8217;m sure one of the mystical, outlawed chemicals could cause havoc to an army. It&#8217;s only a question of deployment.</p>

				<p>Stanislaw Lem&#8217;s <em>The Futurological Congress</em> predicted aphrodisiac and psychedelic weapons.  I think it was written in the 30s or 40s.  Quite a mind-bending read.</p>

				<p>Or maybe we can try working on society so attacks become fewer instead of just improving defenses. Isn&#8217;t that what M.A.D. in the Cold War was all about &#8211; the perfect defense?</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m sure these are interesting chemical researches, but has anyone stopped to consider what would happen should these become available to terrorists?</p>
<p>Can you imagine a cloud of that &#8220;aphrodisiac&#8221; drifting over, say, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?  The horror, the horror&#8230;</p>
<p>Or how about the wasp-attractant dispersed in Manhattan?  Or worse, the rodent attractant: every mouse or rat hiding in a wall, cellar, or sewer would suddenly vault into broad daylight and throw itself at the nearest human.  The city would be uninhabitable.</p>
<p>The mind reels at the possibilities.  Stop the madness before it starts.</p>

				<p>Any chemical with aphrodisiacal properties will be a hormone or hormone analog, and hormonal responsiveness is strictly dependent upon dosage. In combat, there will be no way to reliably deliver dosages within the target range &#8212; enough to make the desired effect dominate behavior yet not enough for lethality.</p>
<p>Nonlethal gases have never worked well in actual warfare. Tear gas and pepper spray are nearly innocuous when used in the heat of battle.</p>
<p>Remember the disaster that happened when a fentanyl aerosol was tried in rescuing Russian children?</p>
<p>This is really a silly idea and should be scrapped immediately.</p>
<p>The drug companies who want government funds to develop it, and eventually fail, will, however, no doubt get what they want.</p>

				<p>I remember that this story made the rounds of Web logs when it came out a year or so ago, and I was rather disappointed at the time because most people commenting on it went off into lengthy analysis of the ethical and other implications of having a weapon that could cause enemy soldiers to start engaging in homosexual behaviour, without sanity-checking the underlying concept.  That&#8217;s like having a big argument about the implications of a DRM technology that really works.  It ain&#8217;t gonna happen, so it doesn&#8217;t matter much whether it would be morally acceptable.</p>
<p>It sounds like this time around, most people commenting are asking the right question (&#8220;Could such a weapon plausibly exist at all?&#8221;) &#8211; but then, it may be that readers here are a little smarter than the average Web log&#8217;s readers.</p>

				<p>And will the same folks telling us we need a Constitutional Amendment to protect marriage from the insidious scourge of creeping gayness find the use of this &#8216;gay gas&#8217; morally questionable, as it imposes the circumstance from without? How about the morality of killing people who aren&#8217;t carrying a weapon? (Or is this a fundamentalist two-fer, smack the infidel and punish homosexuals?)</p>
<p>Overall, I think somebody&#8217;s been reading too much spam about ultra-pheromones.</p>
<p>The common interspecies responses are fight, flight, posture, and submit. (It&#8217;s only fight/flight between different species.) Even if this theoretical gas would make a priest shuck his cassock and get it on, why is it assumed that enemy soldiers would not be able to perceive a threat and respond to the survival imperative?</p>

				<p>Locke comments that he&#8217;d rather end up with sexual dysfunction than getting blown to bits.  However, the average infantryman thinks differently:</p>
<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-mine" rel="nofollow ugc">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-mine</a></p>
<p>It was during the Allied actions in Europe that the S-mine gained its cynical nickname Bouncing Betty from American infantrymen. The S-mine had a great psychological effect on Allied forces, because of its tendency to seriously maim infantrymen&#8217;s limbs or genitalia rather than killing them. In his book Mine Warfare on Land, Lt. Col. Sloan described the S-mine as &#8220;probably the most feared device encountered by Allied troops in the war.&#8221;</p>

				<p>@ Jungsonn:</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most forgotten and unknown methods in the second world war was that the german army openend Chlorine valves along some major borders. The enemy walked into these Chlorine clouds, so they put on gasmasks. Well, then the germans army did something quite inventive: they mixed the Chlorine with a chemical causes someone to vommit. And thereby has to take of his gasmask.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you mean the FIRST world war? I didn&#8217;t know chemical weapons were used on the battlefield in WWII. Some say the otherwise less scrupulous Adolf H. did not want to use them because of his WWI experiences.</p>

				<p>Anonymous says: &#8220;This isn&#8217;t something I want in the hands of a bunch of lonely, stressed twenty-something males, even if they are obscenely well disciplined.&#8221;</p>
<p>and that&#8217;s actually the core of why it&#8217;s impossible.  There are and have been a whole lot of people (many of them stressed 20-something males) who would <em>really</em> like to have a chemical capable of causing humans to compulsively have sex with any convenient person, overriding sexual orientation or military discipline or even just ordinary social inhibitions.  Humans have been searching for a drug like that for millennia, and trying to approximate it with a whole lot of extremely ineffective and dangerous compromises (e.g. alcohol, &#8220;Spanish Fly&#8221;, etc.), and we&#8217;ve never found anything remotely close.</p>
<p>If it were possible for a simple drug to have that effect, I think it&#8217;s pretty much certain that it would have already been discovered by now.  The fact that it hasn&#8217;t, I&#8217;d take as strong evidence that the human brain just is not constructed in such a way that a drug can have that effect.  Just because a military think tank came up with the &#8220;what if&#8221; concept in a brainstorming session doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re any closer to developing it than we&#8217;ve ever been.</p>

				<p>Energy based and 4G warfare I&#8217;ve heard of, but non-lethal warfare&#8230; that could actually be an improvement.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s maddening is that the science behind producing these weapons can be used for good, like minimizing human interference with habitats or something, but no, since the science is done in the military sector, all the rest of us hear is no soup for you!</p>

				<p>Next on the battlefield, heavy rock music being blared 24/7 for psychological effect is replaced with Barry White.<br />
I think this stuff is fantastic. Even acid (the happy drug) was looked at being used in war. I don&#8217;t look at fighting a war in reducing casualities (even though it would be nice), but in remaining alive. I believe Winston Churchill said war doesn&#8217;t decide wrong or right, but who&#8217;s left.</p>

				<p>Homophobia is rampant in certain populations, but even if a man isn&#8217;t a homophobe he&#8217;s not going to be comfortable when the soldier sitting next to him in a tank or laying next to him in a trench starts sporting an obvious woody.  He&#8217;s going to feel even worse when, in the midst of his discomfort and unable to get questions out of his mind, he starts sporting one too.  Chemicals don&#8217;t have leave them jumping each other to break morale.</p>

				<p>Non-lethal weapons cannot be used in warfare, the whole purpose of war is to &#8220;take the ground and hold it&#8221;.<br />
They aren&#8217;t too bad for separating the goats from the sheep though. The military have always held to the doctrine that you can&#8217;t make omelettes without breaking eggs. This kind of research is aimed at only lightly damaging the rest of the crate.</p>

				<p>I must confess I&#8217;m rather taken aback at some of the optimistic comments on this topic.  I don&#8217;t think any of the weapons mentioned would cause entire armies to surrender, but rather would function to disrupt the orderly functioning of enemy military forces at numerous levels.  This, in turn, serves only to open a window of opportunity in which the standard, lethal weaponry an be deployed much more efficaciously.  So this really isn&#8217;t a choice between unwanted urges toward your trench-mate and a mortar round to the chest.  You get the mortar round either way.  If lives are saved, they are almost certain to be on the side that deploys such weapons, which are adjuncts, not alternatives.  Of course, that&#8217;s assuming that they work&#8230;</p>

				<p>Seems to be a good candidate for a movie plot terrorist attack. Image a terrorist managing to release this stuff into a  televised session of the legislature, say the US Congress or UK House of Commons.</p>
<p>Might just revive the average voter&#8217;s interest in politics.</p>

				<p>I think there has always been a way of putting down morale at the enemies side.</p>
<p>The one which i most like it the Mahatma Ghandi way of fighting a whole army, by not fighting at all. Imagine the morale of soldiers who faces an enemy that just won&#8217;t fight you.</p>
<p>It takes two to tango.</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s odd that we got so many Wikipedia links, without any links to the Wikipedia article about this &#8220;weapon&#8221;:<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_bomb" rel="nofollow ugc">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_bomb</a><br />
The 1994 report which gave rise to this was the response to a request for some totally off-the-wall speculation about possible nonlethal weapons, and out of three pages of wacky ideas, just one sentence was about the supposed homosexual aphrodisiac. Needless to say, this &#8220;gay bomb&#8221; was a three day wonder with the world&#8217;s press (in January 2005) &#8212; which ignored all the other notions, which were just as wacky but not as salacious.</p>
<p>Later in the same 3 page report, they acknowledged that the idea itself is pure sci-fi; no such materials are actually known. (Since then, bremelanotide has been identified as probably the first real aphrodisiac, but it isn&#8217;t even in the ball park of being effective enough to cause people to lose control of themselves, even if administered directly, and has no effect on sexual orientation.)</p>
<p>So if this little saga tells us anything, it is what a bunch of careless sleazes some journalists are.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there has been serious experimentation with psychotropic nonlethal chemical weapons. BZ was already mentioned above. BZ, which was originally studied in the late 40s and 50s, does actually seem to be close to ideal for a nonlethal weapon. It has a very high therapeutic index (~2,000), making the risk of overdose very low; the effects wear off within a couple of days; and the main effects are confusion, listlessness and automatic behaviours, rendering the afflicted largely harmless with a minimum of distress. (Unfortunately a major side effect is heat stress, which can be serious in hot weather.) It is almost a pity that it is listed on schedule 2 of the CWC; it seems far more humane than conventional weapons.</p>

<p>If your comment was serious:</p>
<p>If I were a soldier and ran across enemy soldiers that wouldn&#8217;t fight &#8212; they would be shot.  And it it would hurt my morale at all.</p>
<p>You might note &#8212; the 1st Gulf War the Iraqis hardly fought but surrendered in  droves. Again not hurting the morale of the U.S. troops.</p>

				<p>Well, you would not have a chance of morale, if their is no war. When the other party decides NOT to fight.</p>
<p>It would put down my morale if i hate someone, and that person says to me: I love you, even if you hate me. Bigggg put down 🙂</p>
<p>If only one party decides not to play, then there is no game.</p>

<p>Me thinks you don&#8217;t understand that in the real world there are people that will kill you despite how much you love them; and won&#8217;t feel put down at all when you tell them you love them; they will laugh in your face as they throw you into the gas chambers.</p>
<p>For instance, take Hitler. He invades Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland &#8212; all the while England says we are  not going to fight&#8230;after Poland England wakes up to the real world and realizes that if they don&#8217;t fight&#8230;they are dead. And because they did not fight earlier far more people had to die.</p>
<p>Appeasement never works. Not with your children and not with other nations.</p>

				<p>Non-lethal weapons make for fun articles from time to time in the media but they&#8217;re hardly new.</p>
<p>Apart from the fact they&#8217;re so outrageous which always provokes debate, it is interesting to note that hardly any of them actually get to be used or produced in significant proportion.</p>
<p>They seem to reflect a desire for politically correct wars where no one would be hurt. This appeals obviously to some politicians and starry-eyed pacifists so these programs get funding but basically as someone else said they&#8217;re just not suited to waging war.</p>
<p>War is waged by killing and wounding people, nothing is so effective in subduing people as this, it&#8217;s a simple fact of life.</p>
<p>The military know that but the politicians don&#8217;t and the military are always eager to please the politicians (especially if it means getting funding).<br />
Non-lethal might in the future work but they still will not be cost effective.</p>

				<p>@AG:<br />
I think your point was probably that they are made to be used against civilians. If so, I disagree. Many weapons have been used against civilians, and a few &#8212; fortunately, a very few &#8212; have even been designed to do so. But the great majority have not. Your list, even though selective, demonstrates this:<br />
* V2: one of the few indeed designed specifically for use against civilians; but<br />
* Firebombs: originally designed for use against fortifications, used against both armed forces and civilians;<br />
* Nuclear bombs: while obviously intended to shock the Japanese into surrender with their immense destructive power, there was long debate over targeting, and purely military targets were only reluctantly and ultimately rejected on the grounds that delivery could not be guaranteed to be sufficiently accurate. In the end, both bombs were targeted at military installations inside cities of considerable military significance. During the Cold War, the overwhelming majority of nuclear weapons were targeted at military installations.<br />
* Chemical weapons: so far to date, the overwhelming majority of victims have been soldiers.</p>
<p>A less selective list makes it clearer: high explosive artillery shells, machine guns, tanks, flamethrowers, bounding fragmentation mines, armour piercing bullets, etc etc. All designed for military use.</p>
<p>Partly this is because civilised society abhors the targeting of civilians in war &#8212; with certain exceptions such as arms factories, government offices, etc. But also, there is little need to design new weapons to target civilians; the old ones still work (consider the Interahamwe machetes in Rwanda.)</p>

				<p>&#8216;The Pentagon considered developing a host of non-lethal chemical weapons that would disrupt discipline and morale among enemy troops, newly declassified documents reveal.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Most bizarre among the plans was one for the development of an &#8220;aphrodisiac&#8221; chemical weapon that would make enemy soldiers sexually irresistible to each other. Provoking widespread homosexual behaviour among troops would cause a &#8220;distasteful but completely non-lethal&#8221; blow to morale, the proposal says.&#8217;</p>
<p>And what did they call this super-weapon?  Beer.  😉</p>

				<p>In response to &#8220;Am I the only one who imagines a blue-on-blue incident which turns a whole battalion of Marines into gays? ;-)&#8221;</p>
<p>You might consider that numerous studies already show a vastly higher proportion of homosexual behavior in the armed services as compared to the general pop. (Marines being the highest). Most soldiers are able to separate when it is time to fight and when it is time to have sex. The variety of sex seems irrelevant compared to the timing.</p>
<p>This plan has all the merit of saying &#8220;we&#8217;ll drop inflatable female sex dolls over enemy troops and all the straight guys will drop their guns to hump the balloon women&#8221;.</p>
<p>If technology improves and this gas comes to pass, it would most likely become a recreational drug or a joke to pull at the company party.</p>

				<p>In some ways it woudl be good to have non-lethal chemical weapons- if they didn&#8217;t have too serious side effects, they would be really good for hostage situations and so on.</p>
<p>Problem is they can never seem to get it to work-last time anyone tried it was in Moscow, in which more hostages died than bad guys (then again, the government, for whatever reason, didn&#8217;t say what it was, so it couldn&#8217;t be treated). Something like BZ would be good- release it onto the bad guys, doesn&#8217;t kill anyone, then you move in and arrest the whole lot of &#8217;em.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;d need for good gureilla warfare would be something that caused skin discolouration (perhaps a spray gun with dye would be good) so we could stop &#8217;em blending in with people.</p>
<p>And if that ahprodisiac was ever made, I can see a few other uses for it&#8230;</p>

I've been writing about security issues on my <a href="/">blog</a> since 2004, and in my monthly <a href="/crypto-gram/">newsletter</a> since 1998. I'm a fellow and lecturer at Harvard's <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/bruce-schneier">Kennedy School</a>, a board member of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and the Chief of Security Architecture at <a href="https://inrupt.com/">Inrupt, Inc.</a> This personal website expresses the opinions of none of those organizations.</p>
