<p>In every case, the last thing staff reportedly remember is the thief leaning over and saying: &#8220;Look into my eyes&#8221;, before finding the till empty.</p></blockquote>

				<p>No induction (the usual patter that accompanies hypnosis)? This sounds like comic-book hypnosis &#8211; the villain uses their mind-controlling powers on the hapless civilian. And the Jedi Mind Trick only works on weak-minded fools.</p>
<p>Nobody noticed a customer talking to a teller in this manner, or the teller emptying their drawer?</p>
<p>I doubt this very much.</p>

				<p>My guess is that this was a series of inside jobs, with hypnotism being the cover.</p>
<p>I would have thought it was too silly to work, but I&#8217;ve read about this in several places and apparently nobody else is thinking &#8220;inside job,&#8221; so maybe the thieves really did throw the authorities off the scent with this silly cover story.</p>
<p>I hope the tellers negotiated the lion&#8217;s share of the take, because they&#8217;re the ones who are easy to find once it dawns on the cops what went down.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately the BBC  has  a long history of printing silly stories without doing any fact-checking.

				<p>I live in Italy and I&#8217;ve already heard this story. A few years ago a shop&#8217;s owner gave a man several banknotes after the man allegedly hypnotized him by repeating the sentence &#8220;give me&#8230; give me&#8230; give me&#8230;&#8221;.<br />
I am curious to know whether this is a hoax or not.</p>

				<p>An inside job would most likely fake an usual robbery. They wouldn&#8217;t have chosen hypnotism as a cover because it is so weird and unbelievable that authorities would suspect an inside job.<br />
Of course this could be what they want us to think, so it could be as well an inside job 😉</p>

				<p>There are a lot of people on the Net who want to make money by selling high-priced &#8220;how to hypnotize people&#8221; e-books &#8211; more often with the implicit application being rape instead of robbery, but the usual advertised claim is that the reader can use the techniques to get anything they want, from anyone they encounter.  If I were in the business of selling those e-books, then I would want to make sure that stories like this one got a lot of distribution.</p>

				<p>There was an interesting show on television here in the U.S. this past fall but I can&#8217;t remember the name of the show or the network. It was about a British man who was able to get people to do very strange things just with words and body language. Sometimes he explained it and sometimes he didn&#8217;t but he always insisted that it was nothing supernatural, just simple psychology and other techniques. On one show he was able to purchase things with blank pieces of paper, although he did show some times when it failed. He also was able to get people to give him their wallets while asking for change. It wasn&#8217;t hypnosis but it was bizarre and rather frightening to see how easily people could be tricked. I wonder if this is the same sort of thing with the thief simply giving it the pretense of hypnosis.</p>

				<p>I live in Italy and this story is not unusual.<br />
It is reported on the newspaper sometimes.<br />
I don&#8217;t think this is an hoax, simply someone is able to confound the victim (this usually happen to a single person), and often they work with another person.</p>
<p>This last episode was recorded from the security cam, so it is difficult to think this is an &#8220;inside job&#8221;.</p>
<p>My explanation is that the people at the cash is not the smarter and they have a job very repetitive. So they are more susceptible to be distracted or confused when they go on &#8220;autopilot&#8221;.</p>

				<p>Is it conceivable that the thief&#8217;s request for them to look into his eye was a way to coax them close enough for him to spray them with some sort of drug?</p>

				<p>Rapid induction hypnosis only works on a small percentage of highly-susceptible people, but it can work.  I can&#8217;t view the footage (it wants windows media player and/or Real Player which my computer doesn&#8217;t have and I&#8217;m glad) but hypnosis is real and for certain people it can be a state that is freakishly easy to manifest.</p>
<p>If the hypnotic induction fails to work, the would-be thief can simply comment on the intended victim&#8217;s beautiful eyes and go on his merry way.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sold that it&#8217;s real, but I&#8217;m not quick to call it a hoax, either.</p>

				<p>I think the show I was referring to was &#8220;Mind Control with Derren Brown&#8221; shown on the SciFi channel. There&#8217;s a wikipedia entry on him: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derren_Brown" rel="nofollow ugc">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derren_Brown</a> and his own web page: <a href="http://www.derrenbrown.co.uk/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.derrenbrown.co.uk/</a></p>

				<p>I&#8217;d bet on them being trivked or duped, then when faced with the aftermath and repercussions, they had to choose between &#8220;I&#8217;m stupid&#8221; and &#8220;He hypnotized me&#8221; as their defense.</p>
<p>Determining the truth is an exercise left to the reader. 🙂</p>

				<p>I agree that this looks very much like collusion between cashier and &#8220;hypnotist&#8221;. Hypnosis has some prooven capabilities, like allowing people to tolerate pain at the dentist&#8217;s (personally I can do that pretty well without, but fortunately have not needed to for quite some time), but it is not an immediate knockout tool, as, for instance, GHB.</p>

				<p>Don&#8217;t be so quick to dismiss this as a hoax. I&#8217;ve heard of at least two similar incidents.</p>
<p>In one incident that happened many years ago, a businessman allegedly was hypnotized into writing a check to a stranger, who visited him to solicit &#8220;donations&#8221;. The alleged victim had no memory of ever writing the check. Reportedly, the victim had lit a cigarette but had no recollection of ever smoking it. The next thing he remembered was noticing that the cigarette had burnt all the way to the filter, suggesting that a certain amount of time had passed, although he had no memory of what had happened.</p>
<p>Another incident happened to someone I know. As the story was related to me, two strangers approached the victim in a public place and started a seemingly innocent conversation. The victim felt strangely compelled to comply with the verbal commands of the stranger as if under a spell, although no weapons or threats were used to effect the coercion. The victim was instructed to withdraw all money from the victim&#8217;s account and hand it over to the perps, who gave the victim a ride to the bank. The victim reported understanding the situation but was strangely unable to disobey the instructions given, even when talking to the bank teller alone in the absence of the perps. The victim is embarrassed to talk about the experience. People close to the victim but who have not heard the story directly pretend not to have heard about it, to spare the feeling of the victim.</p>
<p>I have no reason to doubt the veracity of this story.</p>

				<p>Maybe they used scopolamine? It&#8217;s a drug that makes you totally pliant, without free will, yet still conscious, and conveniently wipes your memory after a while. Deliverable to the victim as a whiff of powder.</p>
<p>Problem is, the fatal dosage is very very small.</p>
<p>Just a guess.</p>

				<p>Hypnosis is BS.  It does not and can not happen the way the individuals in this story claim it did.  The cashiers were obviously in collusion with the thieves, and hypnosis, as it is difficult to disprove, was used as the cover story.  That there were &#8220;similar incidents&#8221; doesn&#8217;t lend credence to the story, it merely suggests that other thieves use the same cover story with their inside confidantes.</p>
<p>And &#8220;look deep into my eyes&#8221;?  Give me a break.</p>
<p>Some of you need to go back to the first Cryptogram ever and re-read all of them, because you are still WAY too credulous.</p>

				<p>Credulous? Not with remarks like &#8220;Comic-book hypnosis&#8221; and &#8220;Jedi Mind Trick&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m seeing more people trying to figure out how this would be possible, debunking ideas like previous encounters and administering substances like scopolamine. (I&#8217;m actually checking with an acquaintance who is a bit more familiar with hypnosis.)</p>
<p>But to me, it sounds like a story that occurred back in the 70&#8217;s, IIRC &#8211; a government employee was caught shoplifting and related a tale of an unidentified Asian woman blowing some kind of perfume or dust in her face that smelled like jasmine, and then &#8230; oh, dear, how did those stolen items wind up in my purse?</p>
<p>Here, fishy fishy fishy &#8230;</p>

				<p>Normally hypnotism won&#8217;t make the hypnotised subject do anything that they really don&#8217;t want to.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s an inside job.</p>
<p>There is some wiggle room though; particularly if the hypnotist had met the cashier before he could have inserted a pre-hypnotic suggestion and built trust, and then later got the cashier to hand him the money, (which he would do because he trusted him) and then the hypnotist could abuse the trust by leaving. But in most cases the hypnotised subject would wake up at that point and give chase.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t count on it. Even if that purported &#8220;fact&#8221; is true, a hypnotist can still make the subject follow his directions by re-framing the setting to make the subject believe that they are not doing anything inappropriate under the circumstances.</p>

				<p>&#8220;When NLP is outlawed, only outlaws will have NLP.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like typical &#8220;NLP&#8221; hypnosis at all. Much faster, for starters.</p>
<p>&#8221; Even if that purported &#8220;fact&#8221; is true, a hypnotist can still make the subject follow his directions by re-framing the setting to make the subject believe that they are not doing anything inappropriate under the circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>1) It&#8217;s true, numerous studies confirmed that. So, as you said, hypnosis is much like social engineering in regard to inducing people to do something illicit, &#8211; perpetuator creates a situation where what she suggests <em>seems</em> to be legit. something like &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s end of your shift and I&#8217;m your manager&#8221;&#8230; Only you can&#8217;t do anything so complex quickly&#8230;</p>

				<p>This kind of stories is very common in Italy since long time. It was reported to usually happen to money changers, which have a lot of cash, and need to compute how much money to give for the money they get. It happened to a colleague of a friend of mine, some years ago: she didn&#8217;t tell that she was hypnotized, she told that somebody started &#8220;speaking slowly and strangely&#8221; and she was then convinced to give him the money he was asking for, in exchange of very little money. This is usually summarized as &#8220;being hypnotized&#8221;, so maybe she was just confounded as much as needed to accept the wrong exchange rate. In that case it wasn&#8217;t an &#8220;inside job&#8221;, since she had to refund the shop for the money she lost. Note also that no &#8220;physical&#8221; tricks with money were used.</p>

				<p>Although involuntarily hypnosis is obviously impossible, this case shows how unbelievably easy it is to fool people into believing any rubbish they hear! If it were that easy to hypnotise people against their will, do you think this individual would be wasting his time stealing from supermarket cashiers, considering what he could be doing? Hypnosis can work wonders in curing addictions and phobias, but think about it, if it was this easy for some people to hypnotise people AGAINST THEIR WILL, phobias and addictions would have been wiped off the face of the Earth! As for that story about the strangers who hypnotised that man into withdrawing his funds, I found it interesting that I had never heard this potential front-page story before and that you were unable to give a location or any other details. The robberies in Italy were obviously inside jobs, and the hypnosis and handing over of the money was a stage-show for the cameras so that the police would believe the story. Sorry to burst your bubbles, guys, but eventually we all have to come back to the real world!</p>

				<p>I think its interesting how people who know absolutely nothing about a subject , are the first ones to proclaim that its impossible and cannot happen. Even more interesting is the need to impose their belief system upon others, as if their reality will shatter if their world view is not followed.</p>

				<p>i think this is fake..this could be inside job.. i myself know hypnosis.. the way it works is the person is confused and at taht state you can make him do thigns. so the person could be confused cause of fear.. or sleep or daze.. the person is not alert that is the real reason..but the way he did with eyes..there could have been a immediate response by the cashier.. now the othe rpart..i know such people who are very famous in india who..do these stuffs in banks..etc..<br />
they even did manage to get my cousin sister give her gold chain to  give it to them.. can have the full explanations..<br />
regarding derick brown he is fooling people.. cause what he does he tells he usses some hypnosis but usually it is.. 90% of cases he has his own guys planted..remaining 10% case he might do real experiments..but how will the audience know ..which one is real&#8230; which one is fake.. urgi geller another fake.. proven beyond doubt..<br />

				<p>I have been spending a lot of time knowing hypnosis.. the goverment should ban it if it proven unrela..now this has to be insidejob..or  a sort of paralysis.very hard to figure out since sometimes the volunteer he himself volunteers to give the mind in the control of hypnotist ..so &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. a fix.<br />
so it is no ta  inside job..but could be th eperson is shocked that she gave in thi guys control..but this shock which he tried&#8230;was easy to come out with..still tryin gto figure out ..what happens or the other explanation is inside job..and people dont read all those instant hypnosis books and waste time.. no hypnosis is actually possible against the will of a person..even if a person is hypnotised..he does thigns cause he enjoys.. the moemnt u tell him to do things which he doesnt want to he wakes.up..</p>

				<p>Hypnotized to turn over my mother&#8217;s money?</p>
<p>Hi All, I was informed by my mother that her ATM was gone and withdraw all her money.  I am shock when my mother asked me if I took it from her locked drawer.  I answer her “why should I” and “how”, I don’t even know her PIN no…  then I start think of it&#8230; until my mother told me that I was in the ATM  with video and it was  recorded withdrawing her money for several times&#8230;  I really don’t know I did that stupid thing…. Come to think of it that I have good work and earn enough money to sustain my kid’s needs.. The question is “where is the money?” I don’t even know how much it is…</p>
<p>I am really depressed because it’s my mother’s pension… she told me that there is evidence it was me… I think I need help from the police and investigate me… its really sounds weird…</p>

				<p>My wife, who runs her own hair salon by herself, was just robbed by a female<br />
con-artist using hypnosis.  Thief came in to her shop for a shampoo, after shampoo<br />
thief asked her to go with her to get a massage.  My wife said: are you nuts? I<br />
have to work, keep the shop open.  Next day, thief comes back, gets shampoo,<br />
asks again, and grabs my wife&#8217;s hand this time.  Thief tells my wife to put her<br />
valuables in her purse, she obeys, and they go to the massage shop.  Along the<br />
way the thief instructs my wife NOT to talk to the many people she knows around<br />
her shop, which she normally does, even too much so, she obeys again!<br />
Thief also instructs her to tell the employees of massage shop that thief is<br />
her sister, which she then obeys yet again.  At massage shop, thief tells my<br />
wife that she will watch her purse while she showers AND to take her jewelery<br />
off and put it in the purse!  She EVEN OBEYS this outrageous command!!!<br />
 After about 1-2 minutes in the shower she comes out of trance and goes outside,<br />
too late, thief is gone with ALL her  valuables!  This just happened,<br />
June 7, 2011</p>
<p>This crook hypnotist put my wife under a spell really fast and COMPLETELY,<br />
had her under complete control AGAINST HER WILL and WITHOUT HER</p>
<h2>KNOWLEDGE!!!   Robbed her of all her valuables.</h2>
<p>Reg,   My wife was put into an unwilling state of compliance in the earliest<br />
phase of the encounter, fully before anything happened that could produce<br />
an emotionally charged situation.  Her sister runs the shop right next to hers<br />
and people she knew from other nearby shops were outside.  She could<br />
not utter a single plea for help from friends or family that were within arms<br />
reach as the criminal hypnotist con-artist walked her to the massage shop<br />
down the road, telling her NOT to talk to anyone she knows.  Also, from<br />
research I did after this happened, I learned about the Pattern Interrupt Handshake<br />
to put a victim quickly into hypnotic trance.  This is what happened on the crooks<br />
second visit, the crook grabbed my wife&#8217;s hand and held it, the same as I saw</p>
<h2>demonstrated in videos.</h2>
<p>Oh, I didn&#8217;t mean to suggest that hypnotism is a bad thing or that only bad people use it.  In your burglar scenario, the crime would be the same to courts, but it would<br />
 greatly benefit the neighbors to know that break-ins were occurring on 2nd floor<br />
windows by ladder or hover boots so that they could secure their windows.  Hypnotizing<br />
someone to make them fully helpless and even HELP the crook against their will<br />
is scary.  After it was over, my wife felt she was to blame because she didn&#8217;t do<br />
anything to stop it, she couldn&#8217;t.  She calmly walked with the crook, didn&#8217;t even balk at taking her gold jewelery off.  Now she feels violated, like the crook<br />
raped her mind or something of that sort.  She can&#8217;t understand how she couldn&#8217;t<br />
defend herself, from seemingly nothing, some words and a hand grab in under a<br />
minute.</p>
<p>But my point is that crooks that use hypnotism should be publicized more, to<br />
let the public know, and hopefully learn how to protect against it.  I think a large<br />
amount of victims don&#8217;t report it because they, like my wife, feel it was their fault<br />
for &#8220;being stupid&#8221; when they were really helpless.  While telling her friends about<br />
this, she found one that was also robbed the same way.  Her friend cashed a<br />
Western Union check for a fairly large chunk of cash, the crook approached her<br />
as she left the WU office, hand grab again, then commands her to walk to a less<br />
crowded area and commands her to give crook all the cash, which she helplessly<br />
did.<br />
So now I search for a defense against this sort of attack that is most sinister to<br />
people since it can happen in broad daylight right in front of friends and family<br />
making you feel unsafe even in your own shop/neighborhood.  I read that if you<br />
learn to do hypnosis, a crook can no longer do it to you.  Is this true?  If so, you<br />
know a good book to learn it from?     H</p>
