		<h2 class="entry">Third Annual Movie-Plot Threat Contest</h2>
		<p>I can&#8217;t believe I let April 1 come and go without posting the rules to the Third Annual Movie-Plot Threat Contest.  Well, better late than never.</p>
<p>For this contest, the goal is to create fear.  Not just any fear, but a fear that you can alleviate through the sale of your new product idea.  There are lots of risks out there, some of them serious, some of them so unlikely that we shouldn&#8217;t worry about them, and some of them completely made up.  And there are lots of products out there that provide security against those risks.</p>
<p>Your job is to invent one.  First, find a risk or create one.  It can be a terrorism risk, a criminal risk, a natural-disaster risk, a common household risk &#8212; whatever.  The weirder the better.  Then, create a product that everyone simply <i>has to</i> buy to protect him- or herself from that risk.  And finally, write a catalog ad for that product.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example, pulled from page 25 of the Late Spring 2008 Skymall catalog I&#8217;m reading on my airplane right now:</p>
<blockquote><p> A Turtle is Safe in Water, A Child is Not!</p>
<p>Even with the most vigilant supervision a child can disappear in seconds and not be missed until it&#8217;s too late.  Our new wireless pool safety alarm system is a must for pool owners and parents of young children.  The Turtle Wristband locks on the child&#8217;s wrist (a special key is required to remove it) and instantly detects immersion in water and sounds a shrill alarm at the Base Station located in the house or within 100 feet of the pool, spa, or backyard pond.  Keep extra wristbands on hand for guests or to protect the family dog.</p></blockquote>
<p>Entries are limited to 150 words &#8212; the example above had 97 words &#8212; because fear doesn&#8217;t require a whole lot of explaining.  Tell us why we should be afraid, and why we should buy your product.</p>
<p>Entries will be judged on creativity, originality, persuasiveness, and plausibility.  It&#8217;s okay if the product you invent doesn&#8217;t actually exist, but this isn&#8217;t a science fiction contest.</p>
<p>Portable salmonella detectors for salad bars.  Acoustical devices that estimate tiger proximity based on roar strength.  GPS-enabled wallets for use when you&#8217;ve been pickpocketed.  Wrist cuffs that emit fake DNA to fool DNA detectors.  The <a href="http://www.qsleeper.com/">Quantum Sleeper</a>.  Fear offers endless business opportunities.  Good luck.</p>
<p>Entries due by May 1.</p>
<p>The First Movie-Plot Threat Contest <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/04/announcing_movi.html">rules</a> and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/06/movieplot_threa_1.html">winner</a>.

				<p>Playgrounds, homes, shopping malls, automobiles, (and basically any location on Earth) are serious hazards for any child.  There are sharp corners to bump heads, gravel and concrete to skin knees, rocks to trip over, other yard apes to push them down or hit them, and numerous other physical hazards that are just waiting to injure your snowflake and possibly inject biological hazards through torn skin.  Your child needs the new Nerf Suit!  This cushioned, climate controlled suit of soft, microbial resistant Nerf, the same material used in such products as Nerf Darts and Nerf balls, is 100% guaranteed to nerf the world and make it safe for your treasured rug rats to move about the planet with intact skin and bones.  An external layer of Kevlar prevents bullets, knives, or other sharp objects from penetrating the suit to injure your child.  Don’t let your child be unsafe!  Order Today!</p>

				<p>My favorite Sky Mall product they no longer sell.  It was an orange plastic hood with a little breathing cylinder on it.  You were supposed to wear it in case of fire to prevent smoke inhalation. All I could think of viewing it was &#8220;shrink wrap&#8221;.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ll tell you right now I&#8217;m reserving movie rights.</p>
<p>The Waves Are Coming. Rise Above Them.</p>
<p>Global Climate Change is even now melting the terrestrial ice in Greenland and Antartica. Every so often&#8230; whoosh! Melted ice will fall into the ocean, raising sea level a tiny bit and creating global tidal waves!<br />
Be prepared with the EscapeZorb. This convenient inflatable sphere will surround a child or adult of any size with safety and comfort, and is inexpensive enough to buy one for the car, one for the house, and one for the office! Tsunamis can arrive at any time in coastal areas. Whether or not you pop up safely like a cork is up to you!</p>

				<p>Could your neighbour be a criminal?</p>
<p>More than 1% of Americans are in prison. When they are released, they blend into communities just like yours, and keep their pasts a secret.  Is it really safe to let your children play at your neighbour&#8217;s house?  Is it safe to let your neighbour know when you&#8217;re on holiday?</p>
<p>We have the answer!  Using data from the Department of Justice and hundreds of databases such as social security, electoral registration lists and credit reports, we can track convicts from their release, and know where they are, wherever in the country they live.  We make this information to you on a subscription basis, updated daily and available online as an easy-to-read digital map, showing the locations of all ex-convicts in your area.  Now you can have peace of mind, knowing who in your neighbourhood to trust and who to avoid.</p>

				<p>It gives rise to wonderful blossoms. But it will burn out your eye!</p>

The Acid Rain Invisible Deflector goggles we keep you and your children safe and healthy.</p>

				<p>Don&#8217;t be an Identity Theft Victim!<br />
Modern passports come equipped with radio frequency identification tags that can be used by identity thieves to steal YOUR identity.  The US Government says that these tags can only be read using special devices BUT HACKERS HAVE PROVED OTHERWISE.  Ingenious hackers are using specially built remote sensing devices that can read YOUR PASSPORT IDENTITY from up to 30 FEET AWAY!<br />
The Happy Traveler broadcasts fake identity information THAT YOU CAN MAKE UP YOURSELF!  The Happy Traveler sends out your fake identity with more power than your passport so identity thieves can&#8217;t read the real information!<br />
Can also be used to protect yourself from prying eyes of private detectives trying to follow you by sensing your passport.  BIG BROTHER IS HERE NOW so protect yourself from all the latest RFID fraud.<br />
Only $29.99! Also include an additional 4.99 for shipping and handling.</p>

				<p>Bugs are everywhere!  Do you know where they go when you are sleep?  Where they lay their eggs?  Where they feed?</p>
<p>It has been reported in some magazines and TV programs that bugs enter the ears and mouth of people who are sleeping almost every day. Bugs are always looking for a dark place to lay their eggs and nurture their young.  Are you safe from their gnawing mandibles?  The ear or sinus cavity are a perfect place for a voracious bug to lay their eggs.  For $49.95 you can buy &#8220;Bug Shield&#8221;. Blocks out flesh eating insects while you sleep.</p>

				<p>(Comment, not threat) Drowning in swimming pools is actually not a movie-plot threat, it&#8217;s actually pretty high up on the frequency chart for a cause of death in young children. You may thing this countermeasure is silly but I&#8217;m not sure the threat is a good example.</p>

				<p>&#8220;The Economy sucks, but you can diversify your assets by buying gold.  Yes, starting at $1,000 USD you can have real, physical gold shipped right to your house&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sad to say, I&#8217;m not making that one up.  I&#8217;m paraphrasing a real radio ad that I hear at least once a day on KYW 1060 in Philly.  🙁</p>

				<p>A recent study at the University of Wisconsin shows that 75% of minor children with iPods listen to inappropriate music. What&#8217;s on your child&#8217;s iPod? Think you know? Think again. Teens can easily alter the names of the songs on their iPod. Now thanks to a revolutionary new product, Snoop Poddy Pod, you can know exactly what kinds of messages your child is subjected to. Our Snoop Pod database analyzes the digital signature of thousands of offensive songs, updated daily, and checks to see which of those are synched to your child&#8217;s iTunes. Snoop Pod parents are sent a weekly confidential email with the real scoop. Take back control with Snoop Poddy Pod.</p>

				<p>Identity theft doesn&#8217;t just target your money!</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s dangerous world, government surveillance is meant to deter wrongdoers. However, rather than risk discovery, they can simply commit crimes while &#8216;wearing&#8217; your identity &#8211; digitally!  How can you ensure your innocence is protected?  Using the ALIBUY(tm) system!  Our cryptographically encoded transceivers can be simply inserted underneath your skin in a painless outpatient operation, where they handshake with a Verified Base Station in your home whenever you are there.  That way, law enforcement personnel can quickly and easily check on your whereabouts for any past period using our bonded, protected tracking database in the event your identity is suspected! Each set comes with four transponders.  As a bonus, qualified parents or guardians can use our web portal to ensure their children return home safely.  (Ask about our optional PetGuard transponders as well!)</p>

				<p>Fear: Think of the movie &#8216;The Enitity&#8217; that can get you through the internet/over the phone lines/etc.  Cool.<br />
More pragmatic fear: Think of the USA becoming a third world country essentially run by a dictatoship that runs in into the ground.<br />
One of these Fears is now, the other, well, fiction, but still related to the other one.<br />
That is FEAR.<br />
Yeah go team go!</p>

				<p>In a cave in the mountains of Pakistan a new form of terrorism is being perfected.  This terrible weapon has but one purpose, murder all of the children of the United States.  What is this new ingenious weapon of terror?  Hairspray.  According to sources high up in the Pentagon Osama bin Laden is  developing a super hairspray designed to release tons of CFC’s/L into the atmosphere to rob us of our most precious children.  But there is hope.  Mo Berg and Ron Stanly have teamed up to save America’s children.  Introducing the Mo-Ron FaceShield ®. The Mo-Ron FaceShield® is a completely enclosed plastic vessel that seals at the base of the neck.  This complete isolation creates a protective, impenetrable, bubble of air and ensures that no dangerous CFCs poison your children.  After a few short minutes wearing a Mo-Ron FaceShield® your children will no longer have anything  to fear.</p>

				<p>The Year: 2015</p>
<p>The Fear: Unauthorized CLONING. Do you know how many of YOU there are out there? Or what THEY are doing in YOUR name?</p>
<p>The Pitch: Yes, it&#8217;s now so commonplace you COULD buy insurance against. But wouldn&#8217;t it be better if you could PREVENT UNWANTED CLONING of YOUR DNA in the first place? That&#8217;s right. Now you can, with our new SecureDNA oral recombinant DNA renewal medication. Just take one pill a day, and your entire cellular DNA has one base-pair added randomly to a non-functional sequence, thus expiring your old DNA. Every day, you&#8217;re a NEW YOU! Imagine, no more pesky clones biometrically cleaning out your bank account. This alone will save you thousands of Rupees (the international currency in 2015).</p>
<p>The Fine Print: Consult your doctor before taking SecureDNA. Side effects include: mild psychotic reactions&#8230;.</p>
<p>Without SecureDNA, you could be your own next victim.</p>

				<p>Have you been exposed to dihydrogen monoxide (DHMO)?  Do you even know the symptoms?  Across the USA alone, millions of people consume DHMO before they even start work!  Dangerous consumption of DHMO can reduce the body&#8217;s pH levels fatality (scientists call this acidosis)!  Before you put yourself or your family at risk, purchase our patented DHMO tester, the h2-NO! for your house, your car, and your piece of mind!  Made of space-age materials, the h2-NO! can detect DHMO particles down to parts per million.  Its sensitivity becomes your protection.  Wear the h2-NO! while jogging, walking the dog, or working in the garden.  Children love wearing them while at school!  Purchase 3 h2-NO! before March 22, 2009, and receive 2 for free!  Don&#8217;t expose your family to the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide and act now!</p>

				<p>Your Chair is Trying To Kill You!</p>
<p>The number of white collar jobs is increasing. Secretaries, Accountants, IT Workers and so on&#8230; and what are these workers doing? They are sitting at desks in chairs. Menacing&#8230; Dangerous&#8230; Chairs.</p>
<p>Picture this&#8230; You at Your Desk. Your Chair: Wheels – Single Support – Seat.</p>
<p>Suddenly that support breaks and you crash straight down, your jaw is smashed into your desk with amazing force, breaking it and shattering your teeth. Your rear-end impacts with the floor and your spine is jolted as you crash forward, your body’s weight decapitating you against the edge of the desk. With more obese Americans every day, this is a workplace reality.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Chair Protector 2000&#8221; can save you. This device wedges between the wheels and seat; creating a solid base (picture a lazy-boy on wheels) saving you from the realistic threat of decapitation. Buy it today for only $49.95</p>

				<p>Many Americans were shocked to hear the results of the research trials regarding heavy metals and toothpaste conducted by the New England Journal of Medicine, which FDA is only now attempting to confirm.  This latest scare comes after hundreds of deaths were linked to toothpaste contaminated with diethylene glycol, a potentially dangerous chemical used in antifreeze.</p>
<p>In light of this continuing health risk, Hamilton Health Labs is proud to announce Tommy Tester Toothpaste Strips!  Just apply a dab of toothpaste from a fresh tube onto the strip and let it rest for 3 minutes.  It’s just that easy!   If the strip turns blue, rest assured that your entire tube of toothpaste is safe.  However, if the strip turns pink, dispose of the toothpaste immediately and call the FDA health emergency number at 301-443-1240.</p>
<p>Do not let your family become a statistic when the solution is only $2.95!</p>
<p>=============</p>
<p>Editorial note:  150 words on the dot!  Do I get bonus points for being able to sell more product every time the TSA confiscates a tube?  🙂</p>

				<p>Fear and anxiety shortens your life, but lack of fear kills you.  In this complicated world, it&#8217;s hard to know what&#8217;s the right amount of anxiety to have.

What&#8217;s more, each Terror Watch uses wireless technology to communicate with other Terror Watches in your vicinity, and uses advanced AI to compare lifesigns to determine if there&#8217;s a real threat nearby.  Terror Watch Rx (prescription only) can also regulate the supply of medication to your bloodstream.  Available in black, silver, and gold.</p>

Never mind the fact that&#8217;s not the part of the phone that radiates microwaves, never mind the fact that the phone would adjust its signal strength to compensate for the attenuation anyway, never mind the fact the risk was probably illusory, never mind the attenuation being negligible.</p>
<p>Then again, Belkin&#8217;s still one of the companies selling surge protectors for almost everything. If they thought they could get away with surge protectors for surge protectors they would.</p>

				<p>Afraid that bad breath is holding back your career, alienating potential friends and damaging your love life? You gargle mouthwash every morning, but will that last all day? Is that enough? How can you tell?</p>
<p>The solution: our new mobile phone with integrated particulates analyzer. Every time you speak into the microphone you also exhale across a sophisticated sensor array that tests your breath&#8217;s aroma for stength and palatability. If your breath is bad it gives a discreet vibrating alert once the call is over.</p>

				<p>&#8220;The price of freedom is constant vigilance,&#8221; said Thomas Jefferson. And in our modern era our security is bought via the watchfulness of fear. Whether its the fear of terrorist attacks and child molestation or greenhouse gasses and the collapse of the economy, your fears keep you safe. But a chain is only as strong as its weakest link; is everyone around you doing their part?</p>
<p>Now you can know for certain with the new Alertness Alert!™ This small device remotely monitors the heartbeat of whomever you point it at and gives you a quick digital readout of a subject&#8217;s pulse rate within 30 feet (10 metres) of you. 180 beats per minute? They must be hyperventilating about terror attacks&#8230; great! 45 bpm? Anyone that calm has likely consigned their soul to Allah and needs to be reported to DHS ASAP!</p>
<p>The Alertness Alert!™: You can rest easy&#8230; because no one else is!</p>

<p>You need the Bani-Web. Custom-contoured to your staircase, this Kevlar mesh, reinforced with a patented titanium alloy, attaches to the banister supports and prevents innocent young heads from poking through.</p>

				<p>[Beaten to the line on the CCTV angle by EJK4, but here&#8217;s mine anyway]</p>
<p>Recent crime studies show that CCTV cameras only move crime away from<br />
the cameras &#8211; and that could be directly towards you!</p>
<p>With our revolutionary CCTV-Me(TM) wearable unit, a head-mounted CCTV<br />
camera monitors the area around you, wherever you are, and forwards<br />
images to our Central Control Unit. You become your own personal crime<br />
prevention area! The headgear is highly visible to deter attackers,<br />
yet stylish enough to suit your outfit. (Available in white, glossy<br />
pink or leopardskin finish.)</p>
<p>The camera can be rotated through 360 degrees using a handheld remote<br />
&#8211; or in vulnerable situations, activate the &#8220;AutoRadar&#8221; continuous<br />
rotation mode for all-round protection.</p>
<p>NB: AutoRadar may cause dizziness in some users.</p>

				<p>My husband and I are expecting our first child in two months. Having spent more time than I would like in baby stores, looking at baby products catalogs and being bombarded with direct mail, I can attest that whatever new products contestants can dream up that are aimed at creating fear in new parents, they probably will not be able to top the ones already on the market.</p>

				<p>Felix,</p>
<p>Add cellular DHS threat level monitoring and an automatic transdermal adrenaline application feature and you&#8217;ve sold me as a customer.  I can&#8217;t risk waiting for my own body to become anxious in case of an emergency.  I&#8217;d rather have the adrenaline put into my bloodstream for me based on the anxiety of those around me and how afraid the government is telling me to be.  Also, there&#8217;d better be an option to disable that soothing music.</p>

				<p>Is That Security Camera Working?</p>
<p>A security camera only makes you safer if it&#8217;s turned on!  Many cities these days are installing cameras to make people feel safer&#8211;but like &#8220;placebo buttons&#8221; at cross-walks, they might not even turn them on!  Make sure you&#8217;re safe!  Just point the Camera Checker at the camera and press the button.  A green light tells you the camera is on and transmitting.  Works on both wireless and CCTV cameras.   Not for use with personal CCTV systems.</p>

				<p>PAEDO-SAFE<br />
Would you know if organised gangs of paedophiles were targeting YOUR child, right now? Members of Internet Paedophile Rings choose their unsuspecting victims by sharing photos of innocent children in public places. In the park, they lurk to photograph the moment in which her skirt is caught by the wind&#8230; or his smiling face matches their own perverted desires. They swap their photo trophies in private &#8211; then, they return&#8230; their favoured victim is abducted&#8230; or worse&#8230;</p>
<p>PAEDO-SAFE wristbands detect camera activity (flash/infra-red focus light) and sound an audible alarm. Make sure sick prowlers aren&#8217;t snooping round your family! Extra option: High-powered flash will ruin any photograph taken and safeguard their innocence!</p>

				<p>Bully Protection<br />
Is your child is bullied at school?  How would you know if they didn&#8217;t tell you and you didn&#8217;t see any physical signs?  If left unchecked, bullying can result in:<br />
* suicide<br />
* murderous rampage (ala Columbine)<br />
* inability to establish &#8216;healthy&#8217; relationships later in life.</p>
<p>Fighting, even if in self defense, results in suspension/expulsion.</p>
<p>We have a solution: Watch&#8217;em &amp; Protect&#8217;em.</p>
<p>It is a system of surveillance cameras, strategically placed where your child can be monitored (school, bus, playground, etc.).  Your child wears a small transmitter that allows our cameras to follow them.  For young children, we recommend sub-dermal implants.</p>
<p>We have a crack legal team to force school districts to comply and sue the bully&#8217;s family and charge the bully with assault.</p>
<p>Should the bully&#8217;s family lack assets, we call our persuasion team members who are former Special Forces soldiers.  The bully and parent(s) WILL capitulate.</p>

<p>What if you lost ALL your digital and analog data and all your electronic devices in one event.  Furthermore, your car and phones have died.  You are lost and cut-off from the rest of the world.  How could this happen?  EM Pulses.</p>
<p>You are exposed to the threat of lightning strikes, catastrophic transformer failures, atmospheric atomic blasts, terrorist attacks, industrial sabotage.</p>
<h1>Solutions</h1>
<p>1: A Faraday cage for your office, including isolated power for your computer equipment.  This solution also provides you protection from industrial spying.</p>
<p>2: Metallic mesh wall/ceiling/floor/window treatment.  This creates a Faraday cage for your entire person space.</p>
<p>3: Faraday cage for your automobile&#8217;s vulnerable electronics.  This is a popular option for armored vehicles.</p>
<ol>
<li>Off-site backups are usually converted into non-vulnerable media.  Non-converted media are stored in EM-protected enclosures (extra cost option).</li>
</ol>

				<p>RAPE HURTS.</p>
<p>Even as a law-abiding citizen, you can end up in jail faster than you can say &#8220;Ouch&#8221;. A single wrong word at the TSA checkpoint, an envious neighbor reporting you as a terrorist, or a false positive on one of 57 government databases, and you could find yourself in a cell with 3 strong, 250 lbs heavy violent inmates that have not seen a woman in the last 6 months and want to rape you. Would you really want spend the whole night being raped, just because you were too greedy to invest just $99 and get the new ButtBlade? ButtBlade is implanted by our trained surgeon and will provide anyone who wants to rape you with a very unpleasant and deterring experience. ButtBlade &#8211; Saves your ass.</p>

				<p>Flu, Pneumonia, SARS, Encephalitis, Ebola</p>
<p>The next outbreak is waiting for you at your local restaurant or shopping mall. Not in the food, but in the bathroom. You are careful to wash your hands, but how do you leave without contaminating your hands, and then yourself? The handle of the washroom is the dirtiest item in the room, and you are going to grasp it.</p>
<p>ProTectUWipes are large, sturdy, dry tissues with an approved anti-virus and anti-microbial agent that protects you in this vulnerable situation. Take one out to dry your hands, turn off the water, and exit the room, safe from the &#8220;last 10 feet&#8221; of contamination.</p>
<p>ProTectUWipes are fresh smelling and bio-degradable. They are ideal toilet seat protectors, and are flushable. You will be calm to know that you are protected, and that the anti-viral agent that remains on the handle also reduces the risk for others.</p>

				<p>Picture this: You&#8217;re sitting at the dinner table, eating a juicy t-bone steak.  Before you can remove the fork from your mouth, a friend or family member stumbles and falls behind you, knocking your head forward onto the table, driving the fork tines into the soft tissues of your mouth, causing injury, disfigurement, maybe even death.</p>
<p>Why let this happen to you?  Using the latest nano-age technology Break-Fast Forks detect when they&#8217;re moving fast enough to cause injury, and dissolve instantly into a harmless liquid.  Available in grape, orange, and strawberry-kiwi flavor.</p>

				<p>Drink to Your Success!</p>
<p>You&#8217;re successful, and it shows, from your confident stride to your well-cut Italian suit. But success breeds resentment and envy in little people &#8211; the same little people you count on to serve you!  How can YOU be sure that your Tom Collins or Gin Rickey hasn&#8217;t been spat in&#8230; or worse?</p>
<p>Now you CAN be sure &#8211; with the DNA Adulteratometer, you can instantly assess whether your servers have added spit, hair, mucus, urine, feces or any other bodily fluids to your beverage: quickly, easily, and surreptitiously.  Space-age technology has yielded a fingertip sensor that wirelessly signals your Bluetooth-equipped telephone or PDA device.  One buzz and you know, there&#8217;s more than grapefruit juice in that greyhound!</p>
<p>The DNA Adulteratometer detects microscopic fragments of human DNA present in any bodily secretion, and instantly alerts you to their presence in your drink.  So you can return that adulterated beverage immediately&#8230; preferably in the server&#8217;s face!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let your success be sullied by fear of polluted potables &#8211; get YOUR DNA Adulteratometer today!</p>
<p>(The DNA Adulteratometer is for use with beverages only.  For solid foods, the Remote RNA Reader can distinguish between human, cattle, and rat particles in your hamburger, and even tell you whether the dog&#8217;s been on the couch again!  Order now!)</p>

				<p>An Associated Press study found hundreds of medicines in so called “treated” municipal water supplies. Dangerous heart drugs, mind altering psychiatric medications, body changing sex hormones and even superbug creating antibiotics may be freely flowing out of your tap, into the bodies of you and your children. Bottled water isn’t safe since most is treated the same as “cleaned” city water.</p>
<p>How can you protect yourself? Introducing “The WATER WIZ!” Utilizing quadrapole spectroscopy, the same technology NASA sent on the Mars rovers, this portable, brief case sized wonder tests your water for any known chemical or drug. You can test water anywhere you go, home, camping, work or restaurants, and know if harmful drugs could be contaminating what you drink.</p>
<p>Combined with our “FRACTU-CLEAN” water purifier (sold separately), you can be assured your water is clear of medical waste and impurity free for your family.</p>

				<p>&#8212;&#8211; TERRORISTS ALREADY CONTROL YOUR MIND &#8212;&#8211;<br />
Our research* has recently uncovered a global terrorist plot of<br />
immense proportions. The target?  You and everyone you<br />
know.  Powerful subliminal messages aimed to &#8216;ruin your life&#8217;<br />
have been found in almost all random samples of music tested<br />
to date. We are not, by law, able to disclose the contents of<br />
these subliminal messages to the public until DHS and others<br />
have closed their investigations. Some known sources of the<br />
subliminal messages have been P2P software manipulating<br />
and inserting messages during file transfer. Due to the<br />
sophistication of the plot &#8211; it is not possible to clean existing<br />
music files nor remove the evil messages. Purging your music<br />
library is the only safe recommendation.  Never listen to an<br />
unsigned MP3.  Only buy your music &#8211; from trusted sources.</p>

				<p>Werewolves don&#8217;t exist, of course.  But what about tomorrow?  Scientists are creating human-animal hybrids today.  They say it&#8217;s safe.   What if they&#8217;re wrong?  What if they create a monster?  What if that monster gets loose?  What if it&#8217;s outside your door right now?  Are you ready?</p>
<p>How <em>can</em> you be ready?  Do you think silver bullets will work?  What about wooden stakes?  Maybe you need a chainsaw.  Liquid nitrogen.  A flame thrower.  Exploding chickens.  The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Where do you put it all?  There&#8217;s no more room under your bed.  Your basement?  Your garage?  What if you&#8217;re attacked in the shower?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why you need Future Chakra.  A potent blend of modern western science and ancient eastern wisdom, this book and video will teach you how to unlock latent powers of your mind, so you can sense danger hours in advance, even weeks in advance.  [insert testimonials]</p>

				<p>Is your neighbor a terrorist or criminal? Find out now!</p>
<p>Utilizing your camera phone with our software and services, you<br />
can stop a terrorist or criminal act before it happens!<br />
Here&#8217;s how: you take a series of still photos or<br />
a short movie of any person you suspect of ill<br />
intent. Our software for smart phones encrypts those images using<br />
a propriety super secure 256 megabyte beyond military grade encryption<br />
key, and sends the images to our remote offshore supercomputer,<br />
which then employs the latest research into micro-body language and<br />
behavioral analysis to determine the hidden intent of the suspect.<br />
It then e-mails you a special color-coded alphanumeric alert, so<br />
that if the suspect sees the alert, they will not<br />
understand it. Can be used on strangers, illegal immigrants, next-door<br />
neighbors, their children and pets, co-workers, new acquaintances, odd family<br />
members, and your daughter&#8217;s latest boyfriend. Be safe, not sorry!</p>

				<p>Our Lord made us free. We can choose to love Him, and be rewarded by his love in return. Or we can choose to reject him and face eternity without his love, forever burning with regret.</p>
<p>Those who love our Lord will seek to spread his Word. Those who love our Lord will band together to make war against false prophets who preach falsehood.</p>
<p>The Lord gives us our life, and we can use it as we will. The wise use their life well, and grow prosperous. The foolish hoard what the Lord gave them, never making anything of themselves. When they stand before the Lord, He will be angry.</p>
<p>But there are those who would take from the wise, and give to the foolish, punishing those who do good, rewarding those who do bad, straying both from the righteous path.</p>
<p>These people would deny you your freedom. Vote Republican.</p>

				<p>YOU ARE GOING TO DIE!<br />
Research shows that only a small percentage of humans live past their 90th birthday, and 100% have died after 150 years.

We’ve got the answer: The Home Cryo-Kit can preserve your body until such a time as science can cure you and can prevent further aging. Comes in five designer colors. At these low prices you can get one for your car, your home and your office! Don’t be caught without one!</p>

				<p>You are what you eat!</p>
<p>Every day millions of people ingest growth hormones, pesticides and all manner of chemicals unintentionally!  The meat you eat comes from an animal that was fed growth hormones.  The vegetables you eat were sprayed with pesticides and other noxious chemicals.  Chemicals are the things terrorists use in order to attack the free world and up until now you&#8217;ve been forced to ingest these hormones and chemicals just to survive.  But no more!  Now you can buy all your food from Organic World.  Be rest assured that everything you&#8217;re eating is certified organic*, does not support terrorists, and is chemical free!  How much would you expect to pay for this peace of mind?  4x, 5x, 6x normal costs?  Well not anymore, at Organic World you pay only 3x the normal cost of hormone and chemical laden products for pure natural delicious organic foods!</p>
<p>*by &#8220;certified&#8221; we mean we&#8217;re telling you it&#8217;s organic, and by organic we mean however we feel like defining it today.</p>

				<p>Improvised explosive devices are the terrorists&#8217; weapon of choice to turn a quiet country road or a safe city street into hell&#8217;s highway.  Camouflaged beneath litter or disguised in potholes, these deadly bombs can be hidden anywhere.  Our troops overseas are protected from IEDs by armored vehicles, but how long will it be before the threat of IEDs follows them home?  Your family car isn&#8217;t built to withstand a bomb, so how can you protect yourself from an unexpected blast from below?</p>
<p>The SafeRIED family of armored floor mats and seat covers are a great way to put a layer of security between your passengers and the road.  Made of bulletproof kevlar, SafeRIED products protect from explosions, shrapnel, and even sharp pieces of twisted metal.  Comes in black, beige, and woodland camo.  Also ask about our anti-sniper sun visors.</p>

				<p>Cell phones let your child call for help when they feel threatened by a bully, kidnapper, or sexual predator, but only an Electro-Cute plush animal friend gives them a chance to disable their attacker and make an escape.  Your child will love the adorable characters, Tessy Tesla the turtle and Teddy Edison the bear, and you&#8217;ll love the 50,000 volts of neuromuscular disruption these little guys can deliver to an attacker.  Your child will laugh along with the animated instructional video on the included DVD as they learn how a pull on the tail turns the Electro-Cute animals from huggable buddies to fierce friends.  In danger mode, the Electro-Cute animals’ eyes glow red, their electrified claws extend, a loud recorded message tells attackers to &#8220;Go away!  You&#8217;re not my friend!&#8221; and anyone trying to grab your child or the Electro-Cute animal is sure to get a shocking surprise.</p>

				<p>Fact: Happily married men live four years longer than their unhappy or unmarried counterparts and report less loneliness in their old age.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let your obituary read of your &#8220;untimely death&#8221; from loneliness!  Find a Ukrainian bride who will make you happy today on our convenient, professional website, <a href="http://www.ukrainianbridesforlongerlives.com" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.ukrainianbridesforlongerlives.com</a></p>
<p>Testimonial: I was in the depths of despair being married to a beautiful Russian bride who was starting to have her own career when my friend approached me and directed me to your site.  I went from wanting to off myself to getting a Ukrainian bride that sacrificed her career in house-cleaning to save my soul.  She nagged me like there was no tomorrow and made me feed her bonbons by hand every evening.  It was just the treatment I needed to stop wallowing in self-pity.  Now my doctor reports my moods are stable and forecasts a long life for me.  I&#8217;m the happiest man alive and have clean toilets besides, thanks to what she has taught me.*</p>

				<p>You&#8217;ve heard of FUTURE SHOCK, but are you protected against it?</p>
<p>Do you remember the last household device you really understood? Of course not. TVs, Radios, TIVO, PCs, WiFi, CAT5, do you REALLY understand how any of these work?  If I told you that your PC worked because of the invisible pixies inside the case, could you prove me wrong?  If there are pixies in the PC, what might there be in your TIVO?</p>
<p>With FUTURE-SHOCK-OFF(tm), a revolutionary new product from Reclaimed Medical Waste Inc, you can avoid the effects of FUTURE SHOCK (headaches, paranoia,<br />
back pain, sore eyes, confusion and many others.)</p>
<p>Take two FUTURE-SHOCK-OFF(tm) tablets a day and you will be totally protected from FUTURE SHOCK.  With FUTURE-SHOCK-OFF(tm) all your worries<br />
about technology disappear.</p>
<p>(FUTURE-SHOCK-OFF(tm) may cause drowsiness, blindness, leg pain,<br />
hallucinations and/or death. Do not exceed recommended dose. Do not operate<br />
heavy machinery.)</p>

				<p>Identity Mangler –</p>
<p>Criminals are harvesting information about you right now!<br />
Identity Mangler is an intelligent software program that creates randomly generated information about you and posts it on the internet.  When your name correlates to 58,000 SSN’s and 230,000 bank account numbers and 34,000 addresses it makes identity theft impractical.<br />
Other applications of this product are stalker avoidance, government profiling diversion, and collection agency averting.  You can also use it for plausible deniability for unpopular comments you may have made since randomly generated comments that populate the internet will be attributed to you.  You can just say &#8220;I didn&#8217;t write that, Identity Mangler did!&#8221;</p>

				<p>When you’re at the pharmacy you could forget an existing medication, allowing a pharmacist to fill a fatal prescription.</p>
<p>When your child is grievously maimed, a medical bracelet or RFID implant could be lost and an EMT won’t know their allergies or complications.</p>
<p>When you trust online medical record storage, you’re putting private details within reach of dangerous hackers.</p>
<p>But when you trust LifeEncode’s InnuFuse DNA Encoding, every cell of your body holds the key to peace of mind. InnuFuse replaces wasted “junk” DNA with encoded InnuFuse DNA, allowing your medical professional to retrieve:</p>
<p>Complete Medical / Prescription History<br />
Family Medical History<br />
Insurance Information<br />
Payment and Billing Details</p>
<p>Best of all, InnuFuse DNA does not replace your important DNA! In the event of catastrophic terrorist attack, a single cell and human cloning will recreate you AND your InnuFuse records!</p>

				<p>In countless cases of carjackings, the victim has been stuffed into the trunk of her own car, unable to call for help and subject to the whims of her cruel assailants.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do for yourself and your loved ones is to get Jack Hero(tm), a high tech two-step alarm system that can be installed easily in the trunk of your car.  Should you find yourself locked in the trunk, merely push a small button to alert others by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sending out an emergency signal that is picked up by nearby police cars or emergency vehicles.</li>
<li>Causing the turn signal lights to blink S.O.S. in morse code and the license plate to read &#8220;MAN IN TRNK&#8221;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Jack Hero(tm) recharges while your car is running, so there are no batteries to replace. Unlike cheap knock-offs, Jack Hero(tm) has NO SOUND ALARM that could alert the assailants.</p>

				<p>Too many innocent children have died in tragic school shootings.  Some schools have begun to install metal detectors, but they are not enough to stop a determined murderer.</p>
<p>Many killers acquire and train using firearms, or start experimenting with explosives, weeks or months before they strike.</p>
<p>This is why your children&#8217;s school should install SniffEx.  Installed near the entrance, SniffEx samples the air ten times a second for high explosive residue.  So sensitive that it can detect the discharge of a firearm or the use of explosive up to three days after the fact, SniffEx gives enough early warning to remove offenders long before they act.</p>
<p>Have your school install SniffEx today.  Because Your Child Deserves To Live.</p>
<p>Radicalized children may even strike with unconventional weapons.  Be safe from the threats of tomorrow by also installing SniffBio, SniffChem and SniffRad, our solutions for detecting deadly biological, chemical and radiological agents.</p>

With advanced pervasive surverilance technology it has compromised, it follows your every move. Any atempt to ask for help results in permanet loss of all your data, i.e. all you have that is valuable! It resides on your PDA for those few places left without CCTVs.

				<p>Every year, thousands of terrorist acts do not occur on airplanes, but right at home, when unsuspecting families are murdered at gunpoint.  Just last year, in the Italian city of Palermo, two invited guests opened fire and killed a wedding party of 42 before getting away.</p>
<p>The TSA keeps our airplanes safe.  Is it not time that you took the same precautions?  Your family deserves it.</p>
<p>That is why we are introducing SecurAtHome.  We&#8217;ve got you covered with our personal pat-down metal detector wand, our front-door X-Ray scanner (can be discreetly installed in the doorframe) and our terahertz backscatter detector for your driveway.</p>
<p>The liberal media keeps misreporting &#8220;homicides,&#8221; but if striking within your own four walls is not a terrorist act, then what is?</p>
<p>Are you willing to gamble your family&#8217;s life on the new immigrant neighbors that your son has invited over for a barbecue?</p>

				<p>Keep your Loved Ones in the Good Part of Town</p>
<p>Everyone knows there are certain parts of town where it&#8217;s not safe to go.  But what do you&#8211;or your loved ones&#8211;do in a strange city?  And what if what &#8220;everyone knows&#8221; about your own city is out of date or just plain wrong?</p>
<p>Safe-T-Nav keeps you safe.  It combines sensitive GPS technology with  sophisticated analysis of crime statistics to give you easy-to-read levels of violent and property crime rates wherever you happen to be . . . and advance warnings to keep you out of &#8220;red zone&#8221; areas.  Simulations prove that following Safe-T-Nav&#8217;s recommendations will significantly reduce your chance of being a crime victim.  Price includes map updates for one full year.</p>

				<p>Is YOUR eyesight in danger?</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to be a top European soccer player or the pilot of an Australian passenger jet to face daily peril at the hands of terrorists wielding high powered laser pointers.</p>
<p>You may not know it, but these deadly weapons are still legally available to buy online for just a few dollars.</p>
<p>Every time you go out or even look through a window, a terrorist with a laser pointer could be targeting YOU from as far as five miles away.  And you wouldn&#8217;t know until it was too late, because laser radiation moves at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Are you willing to put your retinas at risk from searing laser radiation?</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t think so.  Well, now you don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>Constructed from unique materials and using patented technology, our Laser-Eraser eyewear range provides guaranteed shielding against laser radiation.  Available in children&#8217;s sizes too.</p>

				<p>Are you worried that in an emergency you won&#8217;t know where the Fire Exit is? Then you need an ExitFinder!</p>
<p>Using the latest technologies, our new bluetooth headset, combined with a GPS enabled camera phone, will help you find that Emergency Exit when your life depends on it.</p>
<p>All you have to do is turn on the camera, then rotate 360 degrees after you enter a new room. The ExitFinder will recognize and remember the locations of all the Emergency Exits. In case of emergency, while others panic, your ExitFinder will guide you straight* to the Emergency Exit and safety.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: an expected future (third quarter 2014) upgrade will allow the ExitFinder to guide you around furniture rather than over or through it.</li>

<p>CarryOnBomb™ is an actual explosive incendiary device approved by the TSA, tested to vaporize the inside of an airplane cabin when detonated via an easily accessible button beneath the handle.  While you would of course never actually detonate it, having the bomb essentially guarantees your family’s safety!  How often is a single bank robbed twice in the same day?  How often are there two natural disasters simultaneously striking the same city?  Ever seen two solar eclipses in an 8-hour period?  No, no, no.  Having CarryOnBomb™ provides you the comfort of statistical security for only $599.99 plus $2.99 s/h.  Choose from red, blue, or slate gray.  Kid friendly. Safe.</p>

				<p>@False Data:</p>
<p>Nice idea, your Safe-T-Nav.  Reminded me of Spike Feresten&#8217;s DiscrimiNav.</p>
<p>Allow me to add an entry on Spike&#8217;s behalf:</p>
<p>You&#8217;re a smart driver.  But what about steering clear of those neighborhoods that make you feel &#8212; well &#8212; uncomfortable?  Now it&#8217;s easy.  With DiscrimiNav, the world&#8217;s first fully racist GPS navigation system.</p>
<p>You can personalize DiscrimiNav to direct you away from whichever neighborhoods you want.  DiscrimiNav has three different settings: subtly racist, regular racist, and then there&#8217;s Mel Gibson.</p>
<p>Plus, DiscrimiNav&#8217;s optional PrejuDisplay uses easy to understand icons.</p>
<p>DiscrimiNav.  Now available with updated software, so you can avoid Belgians, Hawaiians, and Inuits.</p>

				<p>From: <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/04/third_annual_mo.html#c261005" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/04/third_annual_mo.html#c261005</a><br />
&#8220;Research shows that TSA officers identify these &#8220;threatening individuals&#8221; by the symptoms of nervousness, fidgeting, fumbling or excessive sweating when asked to remove one&#8217;s shoes at the security checkpoint. Have you ever fumbled with your shoes at security?</p>
<p>Modern Technology now has a solution for you &#8211; the FastLace. It looks and feels just like a regular shoelace, but this is no ordinary shoelace. Advanced Crystal Structure Nanofibres within the shoelace give it an incredibly smooth low-friction action, making it fastest shoelace to tie or untie. At the same time Advanced Crystal Structure Nanohooks help the shoelace keep tight when you need to get those shoes on in a hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your job is to take down the aircraft&#8230; but airport security is tighter than ever.  The cola for your Coke-and-Pop-Rocks bomb has already been confisticated, and some pickpocket lifted your sharpened credit card knife.</p>
<p>Fortunately, your shoes were tied with FastLace.  Advanced Crystal Structure Nanofibres within the shoelace give it an incredibly smooth low-friction action, making it fastest shoelace to remove once in flight. And Advanced Crystal Structure Nanohooks help the shoelace keep tight when you need to garrote the cabin crew in a hurry.</p>
<p>With FastLace, you&#8217;ll be ready to terrorize and take over a jet at a moment&#8217;s notice, guaranteeing you a heroic entrance into the afterlife, and and eternity of torture for your defeated foes.</p>
<p>FastLace: because your enemy&#8217;s security measures hang by a thread.</p>

				<p>Are you sleeping well at night, confident that you won&#8217;t wake up with HIV?</p>
<p>You shouldn&#8217;t be! Blood-sucking creatures known as bedbugs are growing in number across the country! Scientists are studying the creatures to determine whether they can transmit AIDS, Hepatitis, and other killer diseases!</p>
<p>These terrible creatures were once suppressed by pesticides, but the new generation is immune to the common poisons! How can you stay safe? With the new Hamalot bedbug security system! This revolutionary device consists of a hamster surrounded by a moat of glue. Before you lie down in a bed, simply place Hamalot under the bedframe. Bedbugs will be drawn to the hamster, and will be stuck in the moat of glue instead of sticking their fangs in to you!</p>
<p>Remember: It is not yet known whether terrorists are using bedbugs to spread deadly diseases, so never lie in a bed or sit in a chair without your Hamalot bedbug security system!</p>

Featuring a kevlar lining complete with trauma plate (decorative stickers provided so your child can personalize their security gear), the vest comes in high-visibility day-glo yellow or safety orange. A police whistle is attached to the zipper pull.</p>
<p>But the real value comes from adapting rapid-inflate life jackets to urban situations! Our patented ScanSafe™ technology picks up the low-frequency signals of EZ Pass and tire-pressure sensors, inflating impact-reducing &#8216;airbags&#8217; in the vest and hood, protecting your child from vehicular impact.</p>
<p>That same technology is used to protect your child from abduction. An additional, high-pressure cartridge (refills available online) can be triggered to expand the vest and make your child impossible to grab!</p>

				<p>One of the &#8220;movie plot&#8221; threats I&#8217;ve thought of has turned out to be real, and I now feel both sad and angry.</p>
<p>I was ruminating about the &#8220;SeroSniffer&#8221;, which uses NMR from a distance to test nearby people for low levels of serotonin, indicating they might unexpectedly &#8220;go postal&#8221;, with suitable ha-has about the goofy supermarket bag boy.</p>
<p>Sonoma County, California, has a public mental health unit that only treats the &#8220;worst of the worst&#8221;: people who have repeatedly been committed to mental institutions, and who have no other viable treatment avenues. However, I recently found out that they&#8217;ve been ordered to cut their service roll by 300 people. When that takes effect, about one in 1600 county residents will be a severely mentally ill person who has just been deliberately denied treatment by the government and can&#8217;t get other help.</p>
<p>So I now think the whole topic of encountering mentally ill people is not funny at all.</p>

				<p>Mea culpa. I was wrong to say those 300 mentally ill people in Sonoma County &#8220;have no other viable treatment avenues&#8221; or &#8220;can&#8217;t get other help&#8221;.</p>
<p>According to press reports, the 300 people are being referred to &#8220;private, community-based treatment centers&#8221;, such as non-profit medical clinics.</p>

				<p>For germ conscious Americans The Handler is the next best thing to wearing surgical gloves in public bathrooms, airports and when you are traveling. It&#8217;s a keychain sized mechanical device that allows you to open doors, pull levers, operate the paper towel dispenser and push ATM keypads without having to actually touch those things with your bare hands &#8212; avoiding direct contact with germ infested public surfaces. This totally new product is infused with bacteria and virus killing nano-silvers that kill germs on contact, so it is always disinfecting itself. Perfect for the millions of germaphobes who burn through reams of paper towels in order to avoid contact with door handles, the retractable armature never touches you, your clothes or purse and proceeds to kill almost any and all germs after you use it. International travelers will definitely appreciate this totally new approach to reducing their risk to the host country&#8217;s bacteria and cold and flu viruses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is real:</p>

				<p>Your own DNA is your worst enemy.</p>
<p>Criminals will want to steal it, to cover their crimes by incriminating you, or to steal everything you own via the ultimate identity theft.</p>
<p>It will soon be the only trusted identity test &#8211; signatures, fingerprints, retina scans, everything else can be spoofed.</p>
<p>A single dead skin cell can be used by criminals or terrorists to copy your DNA.  They can then use that to steal everything you own, or leave <em>your</em> DNA at the scene of crime.</p>
<p>The only defence is to ensure that every trace you leave behind has its DNA scrambled or &#8220;denatured&#8221;.</p>
<p>dNature Skin Crème, Hair Gel, and Nail Gloss scramble the DNA in your skin cells, body hair, finger-, and toe-nails.</p>
<p>Make sure that everything else is covered by using dNature Toilet Blocks so that <em>none</em> of your DNA leaks out of your home.</p>

				<p>Is your child the next Osama Bin Laden?</p>
<p>Sure, they look as innocent as apple pie right now, but the threat of your own flesh and blood becoming the new America-hating, death-mongerers of the next generation is statistically proven to terrify.</p>
<p>How can you prevent this certainty? Only the HateJet 5000 IsamoRepulsor Headband can stop your sons and daughters declaring a jihad on your country – and the world.</p>
<p>Using space-age technology, the HateJet 5000 IslamoRepulsor Headband can detect any Islamic preachings within 500m of your child’s whereabouts – and prevent such propaganda poisoning their minds by playing the American National Anthem. When the threat nears the child, the volume increases accordingly.</p>
<p>The HateJet 5000 IslamoRepulsor Headband costs only $149.99, works straight out of the box and is powered by patriotism.</p>

				<p>Wireless electronics: Boon to mankind or Fanatic&#8217;s Tool of Destruction? Fear no more, thanks to the &#8220;Sphere of Safety&#8221; from Inner-Peace Industries.</p>
<p>Fact:  Cellphones, laptops, PDAs &#8212; even happy and colorful LED adornments! &#8212; may bring convenience and enjoyment to everyday life, but in the hands of terrorists, even the simplest mechanism can quickly become the triggering component of an improvised explosive device.  Think of streetcorners, libraries, churches, bridges &#8212; as technology becomes affixed  to every part of our environment, ruthless fanatics don&#8217;t even have to try to conceal their murderous packages of destruction.  You would never know that what seems to be a harmless flashing advertisement is in fact, a murder weapon waiting for you!</p>
<p>But now, thanks to Inner-Peace Industries and its patented &#8220;Tech-NO!&#8221; technology, you can walk in safety.  After consultation with leading thinkers of the Amish community, we&#8217;ve created the &#8220;Sphere of Safety&#8221; &#8212; a field that envelops you and stops all wireless,   integrated circuit, and still other types of technology from working! This is guaranteed to block over 250 types of control or triggering signals or actions!</p>
<p>Act now to get our &#8220;Personal Sphere&#8221; with a field radius of 1/4 mile, for only $899.95. Contact us for special pricing on our 2- and 5-mile &#8220;Homeland Spheres&#8221;. Since tasers, mace cannisters and most modern firearms don&#8217;t operate within the field, as a special offer, Inner-Peace include with each Personal Sphere &#8220;The Club&#8221;, a tried and true personal defense mechanism, and backed by our 100% satisfaction or your money-back guarantee.</p>
<p>Remember: When there&#8217;s absolutely no technology around you and you are totally safe, that&#8217;s when you have Inner-Peace &#8482;.</p>

				<p>DNA.  It&#8217;s in the news.  Government-funded laboratories are decoding it.  Big pharmaceutical firms are patenting it. Identity thieves are stealing it. But it&#8217;s yours and yours alone.  Did you know that it is composed of only four easily copied bases: A, C, G, and T?</p>

Facial Creme contains millions of nanoparticles, which when applied<br />

				<p>Who can you trust nowadays?</p>
<p>If the fine work of the TSA and Homeland Security has taught us anything, is that it&#8217;s getting harder and harder to trust anyone anymore. Anyone (and probably everyone) is a potential terrorist. But we must stop putting the blame on our government for not being able to secure our borders. We must take action from within.</p>
<p>I know I am no terrorist, but can I be so sure of you? Let&#8217;s say, for argument&#8217;s sake, that you are cleared for privileges like being able to board a plane. OK, so you are not a terrorist. But my peace of mind stops right there. How do I know you are not bringing more potential jihads into this world? You could be the cause of the next big disaster by raising a terrorist!</p>
<p>YASMIN. The only solution to our unsecured future. You bring babies into this paranoid world, it is your fault!</p>

<p>Doctors have traced the problem to high levels of gamma and other rays, which are generated by all monitors from CRT to LCD and even plasma. This includes ALL COMPUTER MONITORS, FLAT SCREEN TVs, iPHONES, and even JUMBOTRONS.</p>
<p>The very screen from which you are reading could cause you to go blind within the NEXT THREE MONTHS!</p>

				<p>After only reading the first part of the challenge&#8230;well the title, I wrote this&#8230;I know it&#8217;s not a legit entry, but the people who read it think it&#8217;s funny.</p>
<p>Heads Up, Display!</p>
<p>Terrorists upload software into the computers of an Airbus 380 flying from Dildo, Newfound to Toronto which will make the plane crash into the CN Tower. On the flight is notorious Black Hat hacker Alan Doyle being flown to Toronto to be tried for hacking the Salvation Army&#8217;s help line to play the Ramones &#8220;I Want to be Sedated&#8221; on hold. The RCMP discover Terrorist the plot. ATC contacts the crew on the plane, they need a computer expert to apply the patch to disable the hacked software. The pilot announces on the plane &#8220;Is there a computer expert on the Plane&#8221;, no one answers. Then he tries &#8220;Is there someone under 10 years of age?&#8221; Alan Doyle puts up his hand. The Stewardess explains the problem to the Mountie who is escorting Doyle, and they all go to the cockpit. Doyle plays around with the system for 10 minutes, reboots the flight computer, and disables the hacked software by holding down the Escape key. Plane lands safely, charges dropped, and the Salvation Army Band starts playing The Ramones.</p>

				<p>The biggest security threat to America is conscious terrorists traveling with conscious travelers. I suggest that you all convince the government to purchase my mostly harmless SECURITY ENHANCING GENERAL ANESTHETIC.</p>
<p>Essentially, you can reduce the risk of terrorists by removing one attack vector for them to use. In this case, consciousness. Every traveler will be presented with a choice when they come to the airport: either a multi day, invasive, comprehensive, and exhaustive security check (that would be nigh unpassable  by foreigners), or a trip under general anesthesia. For those who really must be awake while they travel, the option exists, but for the rest, they arrive at their destination secure, if hungry and a little groggy.</p>
<p>Fly safe! Fly easy! Fly anesthetized!</p>

				<p>The AIR you are breathing is POISON!</p>
<p>Did you know that the air you are breathing is over 78% nitrogen? Yes, nitrogen. The same chemical used to make gunpowder, fertilizer, and even to dissolve gold! Even worse, according to the trusted Wikipedia, &#8220;nitrogen gas in an enclosed space can displace oxygen, and therefore represents an asphyxiation hazard.&#8221; Also &#8220;it can cause nitrogen narcosis, a temporary semi-anesthetized state of mental impairment.&#8221;</p>
<p>But now you can be safe breathing air laden with this poisonous chemical, with a FilterGen helmet system. Using similar technology to water filters in aquariums that remove nitrogen from the water, the FilterGen helmet system, which fits snugly over the wearer’s mouth and nose, removes the nitrogen from the atmosphere to allow you to breath life-giving oxygen, worry-free! Available in stylish pink or blue, it is a must have for safety conscious individuals!</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s 3 a.m., the red phone is ringing, and the Homeland Security agent rushes to answer the call. But the call goes unanswered. Terrorists have gotten to the agents chair, loosened all the screws, and the chair has come apart sending the agent crashing to to floor, unable to respond. All across the country, critical first responders are in hospitals with severe back trauma. No one is left to protect America.</p>
<p>Now you can protect those that protect us. From Larry-Curly-Moe Enterprises, new military strength Nut-Be-Tite(TM). For only $29.95, you can take your place in the front lines, defending America.</p>

				<p>Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” Newspapers, magazines, books, television, radio and the Internet: these viciously inert media could cripple you with fear!</p>
<p>Scientists at Bob Jones University say fear exploits THE FIRST AMENDMENT!  Any Tom, Dick or OSAMA could make claims to inspire fear.  Curtailing that “right” is the secret to emotional well-being; ignorance IS bliss!</p>
<p>With 1-A-B-GONE, media that may alarm, disturb or upset you and your assumptions is replaced with images from cuteoverload.com, while our lobbyists financially blackmail networks, publishers and ISPs into only allowing the most bland, unchallenging content. Our “firemen” will come to your home to dispose of pre-existing fearmongering properly, plus administer soothing medications to deaden major highs or lows.</p>
<p>(Due to a design flaw, 1-A-B-GONE’s services are ineffective against fear inspired by our advertising.  Don’t worry about it.)</p>

				<p>It depends on just how bad you want to hurt the United States. You can do a lot more killing if you get away with a 1000000 deaths and can then go after another 1000000. And if no one knows you did it, you&#8217;re on your way. Buy stock in RJR, McDonalds, News Corporation. Help make the companies powerful that will undermine the health of US citizens, that will distract them from important issues and keep them focused on the latest crack users jail term. Invest in companies that will pollute the air and give them the power to fight clean alternatives. The movie begins in mountain cave where a group of armed men discuss how to back Oliver North for President of the United States without being detected. A whirlwind campaign uses influence through News Corp. and McDonalds to catapult Olie into prominence. After the successful election, the proponents of health care reform are marginalized and the EPA is neutered. Fuel soars to $10/gallon and a sick, overweight, and broke populations stands in line to get into hospitals that will only accept cash in advance. The movie ends in the same cave with the same (now very wealthy) armed men trying to figure out how to spring Bernie Ebbers and resurrect Ken Lay.</p>

				<p>Mass Spectrometer child food tester</p>
<p>Heavy metal poisoning has been proven to cause children to become violent criminals.  Al Quaeda may try to put lead in the water supply to make your children become delinquents.  It may cause drug abuse and sexual promiscuity too.  With a portable mass spectrometer you can check the quality of the food and water that your children consume at any time or place.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amherst.edu/~jwreyes/papers/LeadCrimeNBERWP13097.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.amherst.edu/~jwreyes/papers/LeadCrimeNBERWP13097.pdf</a></p>
<p>There is a real link between violent crime and lead exposure (see the above URL).  But lead poisoning is not going to cause all children to become criminals.  The drug and sex link is entirely fiction (but it seems to be effective at winding up the less intelligent parents).</p>

				<p>One thing we&#8217;ve always taken for granted has been the free air we breathe; but what if this is taken from us by the terrorists; JUST LIKE THEY TOOK SIMPLE AIR TRAVEL?</p>
<p>Protect your family TODAY with a two-level security policy!</p>
<p>FIRST and MOST IMPORTANTLY &#8212; one day, air may not be free &#8212; at least pure, clean air.  PROTECT YOUR FAMILY TODAY and reserve your clean filtered air!  No tanks to buy, we provide you with an &#8220;air-surance&#8221; policy and store the air for you at a set price and small monthly storage fee (you can even pay in advance to just have it when you need it with no worries!).</p>
<p>SECOND, for the more concerned citizens, we offer a COMPLETE HOME AIR PROTECTION SYSTEM which will be fully compatible with our air storage/delivery methods above.  This &#8220;tent&#8221; around your home is much more than that, though &#8212; it also filters the air coming into your home, protecting you and your family from air-borne pathogens, allergens, people you don&#8217;t like named Jen (optional), smoke, haze, dust, mildew, mold spores, humidity, and even the aging effects of direct sunlight (please note that house plants will not thrive deprived of direct sun, so we also offer grow lights at no additional cost!).  And if that dark day comes where the TERRORISTS use BIOLOGICAL WARFARE, you know you&#8217;ll be safe in your house (please note that admitting neighbors or anyone who was outside during the attack voids the warranty, but you can buy the extra &#8220;quarantine room&#8221; entrance hall addition).</p>
<p>BUY NOW &#8211; YOU CAN&#8217;T LIVE WITHOUT AIR TOMORROW</p>

				<p>You already avoid smokers.  What about secondary smokers?  What if your date, the man you intend to marry, is being exposed to secondary smoke right now?  When he&#8217;s dying and wracked with pain from lung cancer, will it still be worth it?  Will you pull the plug?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let tragedy happen to you.  New Smokin&#8217; brand condoms change color when they contact microscopic smoke particles.</p>

				<p>*** EINSTEIN SAFETY ANTACID ***</p>
<p>You have been infected with deoxyribonucleic acid. Without protection from Einstein Safety Antacid, the government can:<br />
 * Track your movements.<br />
 * Convict you of crimes.<br />
 * Decide which diseases your children should get.</p>
<p>You were given this acid without your permission, and there is nothing you can do get rid of it. However, you can effectively manage the infection with Einstein Safety Antacid. You can:<br />
 * Lead a normal life.<br />
 * Stop worrying about the acid dissolving you slowly from the inside.<br />
 * Eat your favorite foods again.</p>
<p>Einstein Safety Antacid is the only treatment for deoxyribonucleic acid infection that has been approved by FUD, the new FDA subsection dedicated to improving the quality of your life through the dissemination of quality-tested and peer-reviewed misinformation.</p>

				<pre><code>   After learning of them, an individual under the age of 18 will stop at nothing to expose themselves to extreme danger of explosion, fire, and being killed by a fast moving vegetable, through the use of a potato gun.  Adolescents are more exposed to the danger of potato guns than crack cocaine and terrorists, combined.  This simple kit provides the only practical protection from potato guns, letting you easily place a “protector capsule” under their skin in the neck area of your loved one, without their concern.  If suspicious dialog such as "supersonic potato" or "pass the propane" is detected by the capsule, distracting electric shocks are instantly produced while a therapeutic agent is released to produce a 48h "time out," ensuring any dangerous information passes by unnoticed and unremembered. Comes with induction charger.

				<p>Explanation for above post:<br />
I didn&#8217;t say the capsule was small, so I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s scifi&#8230;.  The induction charger goes near wherever the capsule would be while the &#8220;protected individual&#8221; normally sleeps.   I forgot about pursuasiveness though, I guess that&#8217;s not a very good entry&#8230;..</p>

				<p>Yeah, come to think of it&#8230; I think we need a better definition of the persuasiveness criteria.  It would have to persuade someone (who? I don&#8217;t feel particularly persuaded by any of these) to buy the product, assuming the problem is real? Cost of product taken into account? That the problem/solution is real/realistic? Both combined in some fashion?</p>

				<p>Know when your child is in harm’s way<br />
There is lot of things what can threaten your child. It might be your neighbors dog who got loose, or it might be deep water to where they can fall. You can&#8217;t always be there to look after them. For that we have solution. We have to offer a small device what looks like ordinary watch but what actually measures child&#8217;s pulse and will send you a message if child&#8217;s pulls very rapidly rises. The rapidly rising pulse usually means, that child is in great fear or that he is doing something physically very exhausting(for example, trying to get out of water or running from someone). With that you can always be there for your child and help him when the help is most needed.</p>

				<p>Is your computer security suite up to date? Well it doesn&#8217;t matter because your personal and financial information could be walking out the front door as you read this! Elite gangs of Russian and Chinese hackers have joined forces and are working day and night to steal your identity and relieve you of your hard earned possessions. Our advanced monitoring of the command and control infrastructure used by key bot-nets (known by security insiders as &#8216;IRC&#8217;) indicates that these criminals are researching advanced phase modulation techniques for sending your most secret data out over the power grid! Don&#8217;t wait until it&#8217;s too late &#8211; act now by investing $49.99 in a patent pending &#8216;Con-seal&#8217; adapter for each of your appliances which installs in seconds between the outlet and your surge protector. Don&#8217;t have a surge protector? Just add $19.99 and we&#8217;ll send you one, plus $4.99 for postage and handling.</p>

				<p>You are a smart woman, you don&#8217;t get fooled easily. You don&#8217;t believe a word those &#8216;scientists&#8217; say about smoking while pregnant and why should you? That could have been anyone wearing a white coat. If you want to really protect your unborn baby you to take need only one precaution, GoodMother. GoodMother keeps your baby safe through to delivery by protecting against the real threat- snake bites. If you are bitten by a snake while pregnant, the chances of your baby being affected by that snake have risen exponentially. GoodMother is a spray on treatment applied twice daily that repels snakes, dramatically reducing your chance of being bitten by a snake, and almost certainly ensuring your baby will be born free from any snake inflicted abnormalities. Don&#8217;t become another statistic, become a GoodMother.</p>

<p>Do you fear that the medications you honestly bought from that friendly Internet contact are actually NOT WHAT WAS REPRESENTED?

				<p>BEWARE!  As you go about your business, those who hate America may be spying on <em>you</em> to steal your biometric data.  Even now, terrorists are building profiles of innocent people, to truly steal identities in ways you didn&#8217;t dare dream of.  Do you know who that is holding a video camera over there?  Are you sure?</p>
<p>Our state-of-the-art privacy protection system will foil even the most insidious and advanced videographic surveillance systems, keeping your facial metrics, your fingerprints, and more besides, safe from theft.  Our revolutionary system of body-wear will defend your very identity, holding intruders at bay!</p>

				<p>In November 2006, Russian dissident, Alexander Litvinenko, was poisoned by a radioactive isotope, Polonium 210, that he unknowingly ingested at a sushi bar. Over the next 3 weeks his body was attacked from within by strong alpha radiation which eventually culminated in a most excruciating death due to multiple organ failure. (See <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6180682.stm" rel="nofollow ugc">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6180682.stm</a>)<br />
His body was so radioactive upon burial that his casket had to be sealed for health and safety reasons.</p>
<p>Once ingested there is no known treatment or cure! Worse yet, there is no medical plan that would cover this eventuality! If you don&#8217;t believe us, try asking! Had his assassination happened in America, the Litvinenko family would be facing bankruptcy!</p>
<p>A dose as little as one milligram of Polonium-210, if eaten, is enough to kill a full grown man. Worse yet, a remarkable property of Polonium 210 is that it emits ONLY alpha particles. There is no gamma or beta radiation for traditional radiation detectors to pick up. And alpha rays can be blocked with a simple wrapping of rice paper, rendering it virtually impossible to detect in bite sized pieces of food! Small wonder that Polonium-210 is fast becoming the weapon of choice of terrorist assassins, rouge states and organised crime syndicates!</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t have to let this fate befall you or your family ANYMORE. Thanks to recent advances in NANOTECHNOLOGY here at Advanced Meditec Biodevices, we have just developed the world&#8217;s first food compatible Polonium-210 detector. Our device perforates spoon-sized samples of food  with thousands of nanoscale needles, each of which can detect the minutest quantity of alpha particle emission using our patented radiation nano-sampling technology.</p>
<p>The AMB Podet-2000 fits seamlessly into any kitchen. It is smaller than many microwaves. It comes in a choice of five colours: sky blue, coral shell, bitumen black, princely purple, and shocking pink. All for a bargain price of only $3,995.</p>
<p>But what about those family outings, vacations and high-stakes business trips? Try our portable version &#8212; the AMB Podet-2100 Portable is only slightly larger than a standard business notebook case, but will still fall within the carry-on luggage policies of all major airlines. Special deal for only $9,995.</p>
<p>For a limited time only you can order both the Podet-2000 and the Podet-2100 portable for a bargain price of $11,995. Order two Podet-2100 portables for only $17,995 and we&#8217;ll throw in a family pack of radiation badges absolutely free!</p>
<p>Order NOW! This offer won&#8217;t last!</p>

				<p>Terrorist hire a geneticist to modify common bacteria used in oil spill cleanups to be a superbug, capable of rapidly reproducing in any petroleum based product like heating oil, kerosene, diesel and gasoline, even asphalt. Similar to anthrax, it creates spores capable of spreading via wind, water, or through animal and human contact. It is harmless to humans, animals and plants.</p>
<p>The terrorist introduce the superbug by simply sprinkling spores at gas stations, and by flying over oil storage and processing facilites spreading spores out the window.</p>
<p>No one notices for several days, than suddenly, petroleum products start becoming useless sludge in cars, trucks, and homes. Asphalt on roads start to crumble. Petroleum based plastics start to fail. Airliners fall out of the sky as fuel lines clog. Infrastructure comes to a halt. Worse yet, major oil fields become contaminated. The world economy collapses. Welcome back to the Stone Age.</p>

				<p>Ever get a pain in your stomach or start getting a splitting heading when out of the blue without any warning as your driving up to you home you find out that&#8230; your mother in-law is visiting. Well now there&#8217;s a way to feel safe again and be aware before it&#8217;s too late. Simply buy detect-o-meter. It&#8217;s a radioactive isotope that gives off a specific wave that your meter, which you always keep with you, can detect any in-law within a 50 mile radius. Simply slip the isotop in the intended recipient in advance and the rest is automatic.<br />
The detect-o-meter is only $1,999 and comes with unlimited source of power with the plutonium battery upgrade, only $5,000 more.</p>

				<p>In a security-conscious age, government at all levels &#8212; local, state, and national &#8212; is increasingly looking toward biometric technologies for traceability and accountability, whether in building access, immigration tracking, anti-terror efforts, etc.  Now, you can help.  Write to your congressperson immediately about a dangerous new technology being marketed as PrintPutty(tm).  According to product literature, the technology relies on a &#8220;nano-film&#8221; that coats a person&#8217;s fingertips with a semi-permanent layer of material thin enough to allow a completely unimpaired sense of touch, while &#8220;filling in&#8221; the ridges that create fingerprints.  In tests conducted for the FBI, the material was observed &#8220;eventually&#8221; to wear off, said a company spokesperson, in an attempt to defray the fears of watchdog organizations.  However, the reality is that PrintPutty will vastly increase the ability of criminals to perform crimes in a spontaneous, ad hoc fashion.  Act now to prevent this technology from becoming commercially available!</p>

				<p>Do you own land on the East Coast of the US? It will soon not be there if the evil terror cell known as Al Kidder pull off there new plot. As we speak they are laying massive amounts of explosives along the coast of Santo Antao of Cape Verde. When they go of in a deadly sequence, this will cause the cliff to collapse into the ocean along a 40 mile strip, millions of tons of soil falling into the ocean will cause a tsunami that will hit the US 7 hours latter. You will be able to tell the terrorists because they are buying up ex-sub-prime mortgaged homes inland far enough to survive, to sell at a huge profit afterwards to fund their next plot.</p>

				<p>As a senior citizen, you&#8217;re probably aware of the threat robots pose. Robots are everywhere, and they eat old people&#8217;s medicine for fuel. Well, now there&#8217;s a company that offers coverage against the unfortunate event of robot attack, with Old Glory Insurance. Old Glory will cover you with no health check-up or age consideration. You need to feel safe. And that&#8217;s harder and harder to do nowadays, because robots may strike at any time.</p>
<p>And when they grab you with those metal claws, you can&#8217;t break free; because they&#8217;re made of metal, and robots are strong. Now, for only $14 a month, you can achieve peace of mind in a world full of grime and robots, with Old Glory Insurance. So, don&#8217;t cower under your afghan any longer. Make a choice. Old Glory Insurance, for when the metal ones decide to come for you &#8211; and they will.</p>
<p>(Naturally, I can&#8217;t actually take credit for this.  Thank you Sam Waterston)</p>

				<p>There are over 3 billion cellphone subscribers across the planet. Cellphones operate within SHF radio frequencies of 3-30 GHz.</p>
<p>Terrorists have discovered that a simple equipment modification allows telecomm companies to broadcast bursts of EHF transmission (at or above 300 GHz), to the explosive bundle that rests in every cellphone&#8211;its battery. The resulting explosion would carry the force equivalent of PETN, 1.7 g/cm³, or about 8,400 meters per second, with resulting heat of 5,862 kilojoules per kilogram. Much more than enough to blow your brains out. Now imagine what it would do to your heart or genitals, the places near which we carry our cellphones.</p>
<p>The threat: Terrorists gain access to the transmission platforms of American wireless companies and send EHF transmission bursts to every cellphone user at the same time, thus either blowing out all of our brains, hearts and/or genitals.</p>

				<p>Are you worried about turning into a human-plant mutant because of all the genetic modifications being made to our wholesome crops these days?</p>
<p>You need the Clean-A-Gene!</p>
<p>Increasingly common, especially in the United States, genetically modified foods are being grown for their &#8220;added nutrients&#8221;, &#8220;extra strength&#8221;, and durability for packaging. All these genetic modifications however are mixing in with the human gene pool. It isn&#8217;t noticeable at first but after several generations of plant DNA recombination with humans some of our babies will have broccoli for arms and corn cobs for feet! The Clean-A-Gene is a patented food purifier that removes all DNA from genetically modified plants*. How can you or your family live without a Clean-A-Gene purifier?! It&#8217;s the responsible thing to buy.</p>
<p>*This product is not approved by the FDA, and has not been shown to work in any laboratory settings.</p>

				<p>Are your children avid computer users?</p>
<p>Do they play video games for more than 4 hours in a sitting? Do they stay up all night posting on the internet? Did you know that frequent computer use is a rising cause of death?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fact &#8212; prolonged heightened levels in the bloodstream of many biochemicals, when coupled with physical inactivity and lack of sleep, lead to catastrophic heart failure. Age offers no protection.</p>
<p>If this worries you, and it should, there is an answer: BioMonitorXtreme is a small wristband that monitors heart rate, insulin, adrenaline, dopamine, seratonin, and blood sugar. It uses several health indicators to provide YOU with early warning detection of when it&#8217;s time for your children to GET OFF THE COMPUTER and get some exorcise or go to sleep.</p>
<p>If you work or are away from the home, the BioMonitorXtreme can be configured to automatically power down any computer in your home via BlueTooth technology. And it can even send you an SMS directly to your cellular phone, to give you the power to save your child.</p>
<p>Your children are too important to not know whether their video games are literally killing them. Act now, before it&#8217;s too late.</p>

				<p>Is your man faithful? 80% of women who are cheated on said YES! 60% were absolutely positive their man would never cheat on them. They were all wrong. Are you?</p>
<p>Studies repeatedly show 70% of men cheat with someone they know, and 90% cheat with women met online. Opportunities are everywhere. Coworkers, old friends from school, ex girlfriends, chat rooms, escorts, and even your friends. More worrying is that only one in 5 men are ever caught, and 70% cheat again even after being caught!</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have the solution, the Libido Control System. 2 drops of Libido Stopper in his coffee once a week and those lustful romps will be a distant memory. Use Libido Free to unleash the old him. 2 drops at dinner and he will unleash that pent up energy on you, all night long.</p>
<p>Stop wondering if he is cheating, and know he isnt.</p>

				<p>Holes in the Ozone Layer? Green House Gases? These are threats that will take years to develop &#8211; if they develop at all! But did you know that in just 5 short years the sun will be unleashing a scourge upon this earth which &#8220;scientists&#8221; call a &#8220;Solar Max&#8221;? What these scientists or the government won’t tell you is that a solar max means you will be made to absorb radiation at levels higher than you do now. It also means a lot of man-made electromagnetic radiation is forced to bounce back to earth (increasing your exposure!) rather than leak harmlessly into space.  Our patented “Solar Max Aerial Recon Threat” (SMART) detector can be installed on the roof of your house or car and give you hourly warnings of your exposure threat (Green is low, red is Severe). In these uncertain times you need all the protection you can get!</p>

				<p>Don&#8217;t Die of Polonium Poisoning!!</p>
<p>Recall the image of hairless emaciated former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko<br />
dying agonizingly in a London hospital from a miniscule amount of Polonium-210<br />
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko_poisoning" rel="nofollow ugc">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko_poisoning</a>).<br />
It&#8217;s only a matter of time before a terrorist group obtains this material,<br />
and slips it into a batch of your favorite carbonated beverage or bottled<br />
or tap water.  Previously, this radioactive element was only detectable by<br />
hugely expensive &#8220;liquid scintillator&#8221; technology.  Thanks to our breakthrough,<br />
you can now simply use the eye-dropper that comes in the wallet-sized Pol-tect<br />
kit to sample your beverage, place a drop on the end of one of a disposable<br />
test &#8220;stick&#8221;, wait 2 minutes for it to &#8220;develop&#8221;, then pull off the side of the<br />
stick to read out the results as a color.  Also detects the related poisons<br />
thallium and lead.  No American should be without a Pol-tect kit, especially<br />
when travelling abroad!</p>

				<p>Don&#8217;t Let Terrorists or Criminals Track You!</p>
<p>If you carry one of the new U.S. passports with embedded RFID chip, ANYONE can<br />
identify you and track you in a crowd, using equipment than can be built using<br />
instructions obtainable on the Internet, for just dollars!  Terrorists and<br />
criminals are already exploring ways of using this to pick out wealthy<br />
Americans from the crowd as they emerge from Customs, or visit the local<br />
tourist spot or shopping district &#8212; and particular woe to those with<br />
diplomatic or military passports!  BUT, if you slip our money-clip-like<br />
PASS-TECT over the cover of your passport, you can block the ability of<br />
anyone to detect, read, or modify the contents of your RFID chip.  The deluxe<br />
model even has a red LED that blinks whenever it detects radio-frequency<br />
energy directed at it.  Don&#8217;t be the one they pick out in a crowd!</p>

				<p>When the Dirty Bomb Goes Off, Save Yourself and Your Family with the PLUT-SUIT</p>
<p>Planners in government agencies agree it is only a matter of time before<br />
terrorists gather enough radioactive material to explode a &#8220;dirty bomb&#8221; in a<br />
population center, or aerosolize deadly plutonium raised aloft using weather<br />
balloons.  The difference between survival and an agonizing death will be<br />
determined by how much exposure you have to radioactive materials in the first<br />
few critical hours as the area of the radiation plume is evacuated.<br />
The PLUT-SUIT is made from rubberized material laminated with thin layers of<br />
lead; it seals closed using air-tite zippers and the wearer breathes through<br />
special filters.  Available in 5 sizes, PLUT-SUIT provides the life-saving<br />
margin of time you and your loved ones require to escape to safety.<br />
With carrying bag and full documentation on DVD video.</p>

For twice the premium of a term life insurance policy you can buy a policy that pays off only in the event of a terrorist related death. Global warming got you hot and bothered? Relax. EcoFloat will pump the foundation of your home with highly buoyant synthetic foam so you stay high and dry when the next 500 year flood comes. Until now, consumers were at the mercy of these cynical fear mongers. Now there’s MongerOff, a state of the art handheld that can instantly compute the probability of almost any calamity. A proprietary algorithm then uses details about you to provide a personalized buy or don’t buy recommendation on over 5000 commercially available products. Life is dangerous. Don’t get scared.

<p>By supplying jolts of high-voltage energy to your nether regions as you haplessly relieve yourself they are attempting to forcibly make you become sterile.  If they can&#8217;t blow us all up, they&#8217;ll wait us out.  Once the population has thinned enough they will then invade!.</p>
<p>Save yourself and future generations now by buying and using our new porta-john.  Simply strap the porta-john to your leg with the supplied velcro straps, then secure the included funnel and tubing to the appropriate location and whamo, you can do your thing when and where you please.  Simply empty the porta-john in any public restroom when required, thereby saving yourself from certain electrocution.</p>
<p>(not available in Delaware and the District of Columbia)</p>

				<p>TRAFFIC LIGHT EPSILON RAYS<br />
Across the country, more and more traffic lights are converted to LED technology. What nobody tells you is that in addition to light, these signals emit dangerous epsilon-ray radiation. The longer you need to wait at the red light, the higher the dose of epsilon rays that bombard your body and tear apart vital cells. Protect yourself and your loved ones against these tormenting rays that make waiting at a red light unbearable and that can seriously sap your health. Just spray the inside of your windshield with our REDBAN(tm) guaranteed epsilon ray filter solution that dries streak free but leaves a powerful filter that absorbs 99.98% of the harmful redlight rays!</p>
<p>New: Use REDBAN(tm) on your eye glasses for added protection!</p>

				<p>BEWARE!<br />
Why are are all these people running away while you don&#8217;t. The big tiger escaped from the zoo is more than looming, it is no doubt charging, and obviously at you.<br />
Not being afraid is very dangerous for your health.<br />
There are also so many other things you should be afraid of.<br />
You can&#8217;t stay anymore so vunerable.<br />
Each morning at breakfast take a spoonfull of ANXIOJAM and be terrified for the rest of the day.<br />
Remember : BE AFRAID.</p>
<p>ANXIOJAM exists in two flavours: orange and banana.</p>

				<p>They are watching you. Watch Back!</p>
<p>Governments, corporations and private citizens are increasingly targeting you with cameras, microphones and internet attacks. Can you be sure that a police officer will present unbiased testimony after pulling you over and finding something he didn&#8217;t like? What about your ex-wife promising to pick up the kids at 12, then showing up at 10 and claiming that you violated the agreement?</p>
<p>With WatchBack keyfob (available in cephalopod and dragon shapes) you can record all of those things that people wish they had never said!</p>
<p>Alternatively buy our WatchBack lapel pins with built-in camera. All WatchBack devices have a 20 minute audio and video memory. Wireless transmission to base station optional.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be a victim anymore! Contact us today and we&#8217;ll send you testimonials from satisfied customers who have benefited from the restored power over their lives that this device has provided!!!</p>

<p>Are you afraid of fear? Does the mere thought of being frightened terrify you? The simple solution is the revolutionary new product, Fear-Less. Using patented nano technology, Fear-Less delivers a controlled, targeted dose of our exclusive worry blocker formula directly to the amygdala, the infamous “axis of fear” within the brain.

				<p>Dr Watson, I Presume? – Not so quick!</p>
<p>Thanks to the RFID chips embedded in passports and other forms of ID, government agents can now check your identity from across the room.  Do you know who else can?  Neither do we – and that’s the problem.  But with the NewYou Identity Security system, you take control.  Just put your passport and other ID documents n our patented pouch (wallet and handbag versions available) and the bag will project the ID of your choice to whomever might be snooping.  You control the identity projected, so you can be Fred Flinstone, James Bond or Marilyn Monroe to anyone trying to poach your details.</p>

				<p>Did you know that identity theft still occurs?</p>
<p>Your personal information has been made secure by the recent global legislation requiring all financial transactions to be authenticated by fingerprint.  The thieves have again caught up with technology and are removing fingers to get the cash!</p>
<p>PROTECT-A-PRINT(tm) is a kevlar and chain mail finger protector that really works.  An RFID-controlled closure allows law enforcement the ability to remove the device in order to obtain fingerprints.  For frequent flyers, a TSA-approved version is also available so that you can safely give them the finger.</p>

				<p>Imagine yourself deep in prayer during Sunday service, when all of a sudden a child starts crying.  The good word is muffled by the screeches of the baby and the priest&#8217;s message- ruined.  If this were your child you&#8217;d have to step outside, embarrassed at the disturbance you&#8217;d caused, and would miss most of the service.  What if there was a way to avoid your embarrassment, to stay during services, while still tending to your child if he/she is crying?  The solution is simple: the Baby Mask.  When your child becomes cranky and begins to cry, simply strap on the Baby Mask and soothe him/her until they calm down. The Baby Mask releases safe, soothing gases that are breathable.  The Baby Mask lets you enjoy your child without being smothered with unwanted attention.</p>

				<p>Even with the most vigilant supervision, a child can be snatched up by a variety of predators. A prevalent way for tracking missing children is a lengthy effort to triangulate of their cell phone, which involves bureaucratic coordination between their wireless provider, the police, and sometimes even the judicial system. When every second counts, our CellCecure software can give you access to a secured cell&#8217;s location instantaneously (not in days or weeks), and with much better precision than cell tower triangulation. <em>The software costs nothing to install</em>, but is priceless in case the unthinkable happens.</p>
<p>Our charges are on a per-incident basis: using our simple web interface, you gain immediate access to the last 72 hours of logged locations of a secured cell phone for $99. When requested by our customers, we will always work closely with law authorities, providing any additional information they might need.</p>
<p>(this will be even more popular when GPS + internet enabled phones become more prevalent, and will also be very popular among jealous husbands)</p>

				<p>Could dangerous antibiotic-resistant bacteria be multiplying in your kitchen at this very moment?  Researchers have discovered that nearly 10% of pork chops in grocery stores are colonized by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a flesh-eating bacteria which also causes deadly bloodstream infections.</p>
<p>Give your family the strongest possible protection by using Vanquipenem(tm) kitchenware.  Every ounce of material that goes into Vanquipenem(tm) utensils, dishes, plates, knives, cutting boards, countertops, and tablecloths is infused with vancomycin and meropenem using our patented technology.  These antibiotics, normally used in leading research hospitals, are so powerful they destroy nearly all disease-causing bacteria in existence, even resistant superbugs like MRSA.</p>
<p>A recent CDC study found that deaths from MRSA infections have increased by over 50% in five years.  Do not underestimate the threat these invisible killers pose to your family.  Make your kitchen and dining room bacteria-free by switching to Vanquipenem(tm) kitchenware today.</p>

				<p>Safe Dad, Scared Dad</p>
<p>Coming soon, from the author of the best seller Rich Dad, Poor Dad, a new book that shows you how to stay safe from terror.</p>
<p>Robert Kiyosaki spent his childhood living in constant fear of terror. Why? His Dad, while highly educated and hard-working, did not take even the most basic steps towards securing his family against terror. &#8220;Scared Dad&#8221; was held back by his well-meaning but misguided middle class beliefs.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Robert&#8211;and readers of Safe Dad, Scared Dad!&#8211;he had a better role model. A friend&#8217;s father, despite having minimal education and prospects, always felt safe and secure. &#8220;Safe Dad&#8221; knew how to make homeland security programs work FOR him, rather than AGAINST him.</p>
<p>Now YOU can learn how to take advantage of all the things Scared Dad didn’t realize were benefiting him: airport shoe inspections, national ID cards, secret wiretapping, and more! All in SAFE DAD, SCARED DAD. Pre-order today!</p>

				<p>Every month, severe injuries, ruined lives and even death happen when a necktie is caught in a machine, dipped in a hazardous chemical or set alight by an errant spark. If you wear a tie to work or socially, you are at risk. Even clip on ties can be dipped in poisonous chemicals that are found in every workplace. These chemicals will rub on your family when they hug you at home, killing them horrifically right before your eyes. You can spare yourself and your family with the TieDefender(TM). It slips inside of a variety of common necktie knots and combines a strain gauge (to prevent choking) thermal sensor (to prevent fire), and hazardous chemical detectors with a tiny guillotine. At the first sign of injury, the guillotine activates and removes the tie. This is a product you and your family cannot afford to miss.</p>

				<p>Filling up your car at the gas station has always been risky because of volatile fumes.  Remember all those warning signs?  What you haven&#8217;t been told is that the danger for catastrophic explosion has increased dramatically because of government- mandated addition of ETHANOL to all grades of gasoline, from regular to premium.</p>
<p>It isn’t just smokers who are in danger anymore!  The lower flash point of ethanol means that anything with a battery: cell phone, car key remote, GPS &#8212; even a pacemaker &#8212; can cause a disastrous spark.  Protect yourself and your family with Fume Alert, a tiny, self adhesive device that mounts on the inside of your vehicle’s gas cap door and emits a shrill alarm if fumes reach dangerous levels.  Never was so much peace of mind found in such a small, inexpensive package!</p>

				<p>PRESS RELEASE: Inkjet printers serious biohazard.</p>
<p>Recent research carried out by the University of London and the University of Michigan has confirmed that fumes released by inkjet printers are a serious health risk.</p>
<p>According to Prof. Harvey-Plunkett at the London Univeristy School of Medicine, homes are most at risk. &#8220;Have you ever smelled a recently-printed page from common inkjet printers?&#8221; he asks. &#8220;Homes are usually smaller than businesses so the fumes don&#8217;t diffuse into the atmosphere and can build up to toxic levels&#8221;.</p>
<p>The two universities have launched a company that sells HPvk, a range of patent-pending home venting kits for inkjet printers. Typical models start at $199 and basically wrap the printer in an hermetically sealed, hypoallergenic plastic bubble. Visit HPvk.com immediately to buy yours.  Don&#8217;t delay &#8211; you could injure your family.</p>

				<p>This year&#8217;s spring season will bring more than annoying pollen and allergies. There is a silent menace on the way, and we will be powerless to stop it. The threat is a potent chemical called &#8220;O2&#8221;. It&#8217;s powerful enough to corrode metal. It&#8217;s a leading cause in over 78% of house fires. And its toxic effects include nausea, lung damage, and convulsions. A recent study has identified over 120 species of plants in your local area that release large amounts of O2 into the atmosphere, and scientists predict that by the end of the year, O2 levels in your city will reach over 200,000 parts per million.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there&#8217;s a solution: LifeSeal™. Just fit the comfortable plastic sac over your head, secure the elastic neck bands, and you&#8217;ll be protected by an airtight bubble of safety. Don&#8217;t give in to the threat of O2. Seal your fate with LifeSeal™!</p>

				<p>Most women are unaware of the risks related to urination. Whenever you use a public toilet, you are exposed to bacteria that may cause serious disease and urinary tract infection. Your children may have been infected already.</p>
<p>Bacteria is everywhere, door handles, soap dispensers, toilet seats, paper rolls, hand dryers, seat lids, or even in the air. According to the WHO, urinary tract infection accounts for more than 9 million doctor visits in the US and about $1.8 billion in health costs each year. In a world where you just cannot control who uses what, you need to take measures for your own safety. With SafeToilet(TM) you and your kids will never have to worry about public toilets.</p>
<p>SafeToilet Kit costs $3 and contains:<br />
  1 seat cover.<br />
  1 glove.<br />
  1 nurse mask.<br />
  1 anti-bacterial hand sanitizer.<br />
  1 mini paper roll</p>
<p>Protect yourself against bacteria with SafeToilet.</p>

				<p>My entry for the threat contest:</p>
<p>Surveillance cameras protect our safety 24/7 in a lot of places, but what if some stranger looking like you committed a crime in plain view of one? And what if you were not among friends at the time, and have no one to testify you were somewhere else?<br />
Our Alibi Anywhere cell phone has a built in camera with retinal scan capability and a fingerprint scanner that allow you to store proof of your identity and whereabouts on our servers whenever you are alone. Strong encryption provides further authentication and protects your privacy. Need proof that it wasn’t you on camera? Hand over your personal Alibi Anywhere key to the police, and they can unlock your alibi in seconds.</p>

				<p>Are you having breakfast with a killer?</p>
<p>Can you really trust the man across the dinner table? No! In fact he is the most likely person to kill you!<br />
Scientific research shows that a vast majority of all murder victims are killed by a family member or &#8220;friend&#8221; of the family!<br />
But finally there is a way to outsmart them.<br />
Our  “Domestic Survival” computer program use the real life data of more than 1.500 killers to judge the risk you are in. All you need to do is enter any persons preferences regarding food, clothing, toothpaste and cars, as well as sleeping patterns and other personal traits, and the system will automatically compute how closely related  that person&#8217;s behaviour is to a known murderer.<br />
It will even tell you how that murderer killed his victim, leaving you the opportunity to strike first.<br />
Trust is good, but science is safe!</p>

				<p>“…The only thing to fear is fear itself …” said President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his 1933 inaugural. The differences today are the quantity and quality of our fears. Everything from what is in our closet that can kill us (news at 11) to wars and pandemics. If it is not a threat from a foreign country it is our own elected officials stealing from our wallets and taking our constitutional rights away. Whatever it is that tips your fear monitor into the red zone the folks at LOran, BOnner, and TOMaY will remove all your fears.

				<p>Do you know where your money is?  The government does!<br />
Recent decisions by the Supreme Court may lead the US government to confiscate your bank account to pay off the national debt!  The debt is now over $9 TRILLION!  The government has realized it can&#8217;t possibly repay such a large amount and politicians have anonymously acknowledged the need to invoke EMINENT DOMAIN over citizens’ bank accounts.  Protect your account now with Cash Cloaker!  This highly secure system will transfer the money in your bank accounts to locations outside the US where the government can’t take it.  Simply sign in to Cash Cloaker and input your bank accounts.  Your money will be automatically transferred to a bank in Switzerland using 1,000 bit encryption.  You can still use your existing bank accounts; Cash Cloaker is totally transparent and secure!  Act now before the politicians do!</p>

				<p>Have you ever worried about leaving your child at day care?<br />
We don&#8217;t blame you. We&#8217;ve been watching the news too, and have looked on<br />
in horror as story after story of child abuse or abduction unfolds. There<br />
is no safe place for your little ones, because statistics actually show<br />
that most child molestation is perpetrated by close relatives.<br />
But now you can rest easy with the new ToddlerChastity(TM) belt. Coming in<br />
seven attractive color combinations, these totally tamperproof belts cover<br />
your toddler&#8217;s private parts, and only you hold the key!<br />
Why did the vikings trust chastity belts to keep their wives on the<br />
straight and narrow? Simply because there&#8217;s no way around them!<br />
ToddlerChastity(TM)&#8217;s clever design makes for easy cleaning, even without<br />
the key. Perfectly hygienic, especially for babies. Optional GPS-tracking<br />
model available for recovering your loved ones in case of abduction.</p>

				<p>Are you afraid? Do you ever walk around outside your house? With all the class<br />
action lawsuits going on, do you ever worry about being worried? Fear fear<br />
no more!<br />
With new Capabloxim you need never fear fear.                          As F.D.Roosevelt once said: &#8220;The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself.&#8221;<br />

				<p>In today&#8217;s work or school environment, even a mutually consensual hug could be a recipe for disaster. Innocent hugging could lead to claims of harassment or worse. Furthermore, disallowing hugs is an important way to convey authority. The Shrugs-Not-Hugs™ system uses surveillance cameras and refined behavior-recognition technology to quickly detect hugs. An individual can be automatically notified when a hug is detected. With the optional facial-recognition feature, the system can attempt to identify and record the perpetrators for each detected hug. In an age where fearfulness, zero-tolerance policies, and suspicion is as important as fire alarms, school principals and business managers can&#8217;t afford to be without the Shrugs-Not-Hugs™ system.</p>

				<p>Earlier I posted the &#8220;Crime in Progress Detector&#8221;, where the basic idea was to maximize fear by adding as much &#8220;real&#8221; alarm input as possible (same principle as  the news, really). As usual reality beats fiction, Honda&#8217;s combining GPS with crime statistics in their cars. How can you ever feel safe when your car constantly reminds you that you&#8217;re surrounded by criminals?<br />

				<p>Carbon dioxide (C02); it&#8217;s odourless and easy to obtain, yet at high concentration it can slowly disable and kill you before you even realise.  Terrorists may even find concentrated CO2 in your office due to normal government fire regulations!  Most poison gas detectors don&#8217;t even detect carbon dioxide since it is present at low concentrations in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Buy &#8220;breath-through&#8221; for all your office:  Individual CO2 alarms for every desk and a breathing system which starts automatically and will give your staff 30 minutes to either wait out an attack or, with the special portable option, to leave the area safely.  Only $10000 per desk.  A small price for peace of mind. ; bulk discounts available on orders over 300.</p>

				<p>MOSSAD thought surveillance subsystem works similar to their spoken word surveillance subsystem (which is similar to the NASA patent application 20050220310 method) by decoding the reflected modulated microwave radiation. The difference being that it decodes the modulated by the brainwaves microwaves reflected by the brain of the targeted person. Then MOSSAD AI engine translate the brainwaves into the actual thoughts.</p>
<p>MOSSAD wireless system works worldwide thru retransmission centers and stealthily commandeered satellites. Their agents can securely operate the system from Israel.</p>
<p>Anybody with IP or other secrets in their heads should be afraid. For most MOSSAD system does undetectable eavesdropping on thoughts.</p>
<p>To defend your house or office against MOSSAD or MOSSAD like systems we offer consulting. To defend your thoughts and spoken words from eavesdropping when you are outside your house we are developing sensor-jammer.</p>

<p>Written by University of Arizona math professor Walter W. Piegorsch and two<br />
others colleagues and published in a recent edition of the journal Risk<br />

				<p>The wireless pick-pocket doesn’t have to brush against you on a bus or train, but he can still lift details from your bank cards while they’re in your pocket. He might even scan them from across a room or through a ceiling! He can clone your door access card, steal your identity, and steal your money.  And the pick-pocket-turned-terrorist can know your country of origin just by scanning your ePassport from afar.</p>
<p>You can defeat this modern-day Artful Dodger using SkimStopper products to shield your wireless-enabled cards and passports from attack. Slide the card or passport into a low-cost SkimStopper sleeve, or a luxury SkimStopper leather wallet, and it is then safe and secure until YOU decide to take it out.</p>
<p>SkimStopper products are already used by those ‘in the know’, and are mandated for military personnel. Fully approved as ‘electromagnetically opaque’, you too need SkimStopper to stay safe.</p>

				<p>Sometimes you see ‘them’, most times you don’t. You hear about ‘them’ every place you go and whatever you do. ‘They’ are telling you what to think, what to believe, and what not to believe. ‘They’ are tracking you, listening to your conversations, and monitoring your associations. ‘They’ are directing your action and inaction. Everything you do or don’t do, every breath you take, ‘they’ are monitoring and noting. If you mention &#8216;them&#8217; to anyone you are labeled –paranoid-, you are told to seek help, sometimes, help is sought for you.<br />
Break free from ‘them’.<br />
Come join US.<br />
We know the truth about ‘them’.<br />
You know that only people who know the truth, as you know the truth, can set you free from ‘them’.<br />
Step away from ‘them’ and come to us.<br />
Call us at LOB-OTOM. You know the time to be free of ‘them’ is now!</p>

				<p>No leaks in this man&#8217;s vigilance!</p>
<p>A man is never more vulnerable than when he is standing at a urinal, facing the wall.   He has no idea who may be lurking behind or what they may be doing &#8212; until now!   The 180 Degree Loo View easily attaches to any public restroom wall and the scientifically engineered reflective curved surface affords a clear view of the entire room behind.   Just place it on the wall at eye level, keep your gaze facing forward and still know what goes on behind!   No craning the neck or shooting around to sneak a peak.   Now you can go on about your business in peace and without nasty surprises.   A great gift for Dads and Grads!</p>

				<p>Many people are upset that all our telephone calls are routed through a filter looking for suspictious words.  Those emails/phone calls etc, are then sent for further inspection.</p>
<p>Cure:  attach to each and every email some boiler plate containing what you determine to be suspicious words in a long, unintelligible string.  For example:</p>
<p>ru48dp 484620 Bush 436292y department of the army.. 3gslv0sbfg5 bomb ue9eyt attach ;a9a;a8a57afagta<br />

Icicles kill! Every year people die from falling icicles. You think you are safe, but you are not! You will never see it coming.

Unless you have nothing to lose and you are ready to leave this world with an icicle stuck in your head you will make the wise choice and purchase IPS (icicles-protect-system).<br />
 It comes in a hat, and with a uniquely designed system to detect a falling icicle and inflate a specially design and tested on humans, umbrella which will block you head from it. For only 30 dollars you can enjoy every winter day and if you spare another 15 bucks we will upgrade your IPS to RIPS (rocks and icicles protect system). We make special deliveries in winter; you won’t have to leave your home without it.</p>

				<p>The Crushion™</p>
<p>All it takes is a loose carpet. A wobbly stone. Or a unseen tree root. Every day, countless of elderly people slip and break a leg or hip. For them it can be a life-threatening injury.</p>
<p>Prevent those disasters with the Crushion™!</p>
<p>Our latest product detects an impending fall of the wearer with the latest solid-state gyroscope technology. The advanced control system will then instantly inflate eight air cushions, which break the fall. It’s like landing on a fluffy pillow. The industrial strength titanium alloy frame provides maximum rigidity while preserving comfort.</p>
<p>Remember, your parents looked after you when you were a kid. Now it’s your time to pay back the honor.</p>

				<p>Protect yourself from NLP web attacks.<br />
Neuro Linguistic Programming is already used by mega business and various government<br />
agencies to model your behavior and create personal profiles that are frighteningly close<br />
to real life. First, your behavior is analyzed based on recorded conversations,<br />
blog posts, chat room logs, email, typing style, and body language.<br />
Then, a predictive model of your personality is created and stored.<br />
Lastly, your future interactions with the Neuro Linguistic Programme are subject<br />
to personalization filters designed to influence your thoughts and behavior.<br />
You are presented with images, patterns and text designed specifically to impact you.<br />
You can be unconsciously persuaded to do things you NEVER planned to do.<br />
On April 2008, a web site belonging to SDB<br />
(an anarchist group nicknamed &#8220;the Sect of the Deceased Bovine&#8221;)<br />
published NLP extensions to most existing blog platforms.<br />
We can protect you. Call 1-782-NOTONLP and let our consultants help you.</p>

				<p>Free software supports terrorists and sex offenders, helping them carry out their evil schemes.  Our Approved Software Scheme will eliminate this software forever.</p>
<p>Free software lets our enemies plan their terror using cryptography, distribute their perverted pictures online, and hide any trace of their activity.</p>
<p>The variety of software makes it difficult for law enforcement agencies to obtain forensic data, or place programs on computers to monitor suspects’ activity.</p>
<p>Vendors &#8211; buy a license, and your software will be placed on the approved list.  Users &#8211; buy an approved operating system, and only approved programs will run, making you and the world safer.</p>
<p>Our representatives are currently lobbying hard to have this scheme made mandatory, so hop on board and beat the rush &#8211; early-bird discount fees available.</p>
<p>Approved Software IS free software &#8211; not free as in beer, not free as in speech, but free as in America!</p>

				<p>::::SECURE EYEDROPPER::::<br />
If you are an eyedrop user, you may realize how easy to refill your eyedropper, replace the content with other liquid. If you are lucky, it maybe just plain water. But things may go far worst if you heard of Murphy’s Law. A colleague may find it funny to let you try capsicum eyedrop, and watch you crying for a whole afternoon. A urine eyedrop maybe a joke to make the whole classroom laugh, and becomes an embarrassed story when your classmates remind each other about you years later. ^_^!! If your little enemy finds a chance to fill some acid, people may blind for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>Our newly product, SECURE EYEDROPPER which only drops out NEVER sucks in will be your choose. So do remember our logo “)(“ when you purchase any eyedrop product. This ensures the right content always in the right bottle.</p>

				<p>Fear comes from instability, from lost of trust, not knowing what comes&#8230;so one movie idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>bad guys threaten as much as possible simple persons on small places (explosion of a small fuel station, small shop, small community, churches&#8230;or other &#8220;general&#8221; areas)</li>
<li>bad guys records as much as possible about their action and publish them on the net with the message &#8220;coming soon to a place near you&#8230;or exactly there where you or your friends will be&#8221;</li>
<li>bad guys has to lie/modify as much as possible in small places and without very big direct effects, I mean:</li>
</ol>
<p>&#8211; wheather forecast site<br />
&#8211; timetables for train, plane etc.<br />
&#8211; stock news<br />
&#8211; etcetcetc<br />
The meaning is to place the doubtfulness in people&#8230;in some years they may hack digital TV broadcasts also and play false news also (e.g. tell the people that red alert is coming, and they must go and buy as much food as possible&#8230;)</p>
<p>When people cannot be sure in the input lines and they see that attack may happen everywhere, they&#8217;ll fear the most!</p>

				<p>Re-do 9/11, only better!</p>
<p>Plot: scheme to exploit laziness and technology. Only one sacrificial terrorist per flight!<br />
Idea: passive (BT-activated) explosive device in luggage. Team works waiting area to get phone numbers from passengers who will be boarding.<br />
Execution: exploiting technology weakness, terrorists use remote control to gain access to passenger&#8217;s BlackBerry while in-flight. Blackberry is then used as local remote control device for activating and then detonating bomb in luggage. Knowing flight paths &amp; speeds permits terrorists to turn jets into missiles without needing to actually be piloting.</p>

I've been writing about security issues on my <a href="/">blog</a> since 2004, and in my monthly <a href="/crypto-gram/">newsletter</a> since 1998. I'm a fellow and lecturer at Harvard's <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/bruce-schneier">Kennedy School</a>, a board member of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and the Chief of Security Architecture at <a href="https://inrupt.com/">Inrupt, Inc.</a> This personal website expresses the opinions of none of those organizations.</p>
