		<h2 class="entry">New TSA ID Requirement</h2>
		<p>The TSA has a <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/enhance_id_requirements.shtm">new photo ID requirement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Beginning Saturday, June 21, 2008 passengers that willfully refuse to provide identification at security checkpoint will be denied access to the secure area of airports. This change will apply exclusively to individuals that simply refuse to provide any identification or assist transportation security officers in ascertaining their identity.</p>
<p>This new procedure will not affect passengers that may have misplaced, lost or otherwise do not have ID but are cooperative with officers. Cooperative passengers without ID may be subjected to additional screening protocols, including enhanced physical screening, enhanced carry-on and/or checked baggage screening, interviews with behavior detection or law enforcement officers and other measures.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13739_3-9962760-46.html">That&#8217;s right</a>; people who refuse to show ID on principle will not be allowed to fly, but people who claim to have lost their ID will.  I feel well-protected against terrorists who can&#8217;t lie.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think any further proof is needed that the ID requirement has <a href="http://www.schneier.com/essay-008.html">nothing</a> to <a href="http://www.schneier.com/essay-052.html">do</a> with <a href="http://www.schneier.com/essay-132.html">security</a>, and everything to do with <a href="http://techliberation.com/2008/06/09/id-checks-are-about-control-not-security/">control</a>.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m missing something. I thought the right to fly without requiring ID had already been ok&#8217;d by the courts &#8211; how can the TSA administratively override something like that?</p>

				<p>I thought it was actually illegal to ask for identification for domestic travel? Did TSA get the law changed or something? Or is this only for international flights?</p>

				<p>I thought the courts had decided that it was unconstitutional to absolutely ban flying without ID, which this seems to violate.</p>
<p>The decision did allow increased screening for those without idea, including enhanced searches.</p>

				<p>&#8220;or otherwise do not have ID&#8221; probably covers people who do not have an ID at all, so there probably isn&#8217;t a constitutional violation.</p>

				<p>This would seem to run as thoroughly afoul of the constitution as it is possible to do while still being completely ineffective against the ostensible threat.</p>
<p>I wonder how they will treat people who admit, after prolonged questioning, to having lost or mislaid their ID deliberately because of a disagreement with the TSA&#8217;s position. Or what about people who don&#8217;t produce ID in a fit of pique rather than on deeply-held principle?</p>
<p>You have to work really hard to be this offensively stupid.</p>

				<p>@Fnord:</p>
<p>I&#8217;d imagine the legal work around here is that they haven&#8217;t actually banned flying without ID &#8211; You can still fly if you&#8217;re willing to swear that you&#8217;ve lost it/don&#8217;t have it/etc.</p>
<p>What they&#8217;ve banned is flying after having <em>refused</em> to produce ID.  Because after all, if you refuse to produce ID, there must be a reason, and since it&#8217;s obvious that only a criminal/terrorist/&#8221;Really Bad Person&#8221;(tm) would <em>want</em> to avoid identification, TSA now has probable cause to detain you for further questioning.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, you can be certain they&#8217;ll be looking extra-hard for the ID you claim to have lost when they hand-search you, and I&#8217;d imagine the treatment won&#8217;t be courteous if they find it.</p>

				<p>This is possibly aimed also at immigrant control as well. If you look at all like you may be from, oh, say, the Middle East, Africa, or South of the Border, and you don&#8217;t how ID I&#8217;m guessing your grilling will be significantly more thorough than someone who looks like a WASP.</p>

				</p>

				<p>You don&#8217;t need to look any further than the title of that linked posting to see the propaganda is already the driving force behind this.</p>
<p>The phrase &#8220;to increase safety&#8221; is added to the announcement title, as if there are other TSA actions that aren&#8217;t to increase safety?</p>
<p>Nah, more likely the invocation of the fear and safety demons is needed up front to avoid the questions about constitutionality and jurisdiction.  Or maybe the TSA is so heavily into the &#8220;securocracy&#8221; game that they actually believe that everything they do needs to be labeled with &#8220;for safety&#8221;, &#8220;to protect the children&#8221;, or the nearly obligatory &#8220;to protect you from terrorists&#8221;.</p>
<p>If, in fact, the move did something other than theater and control measures, and wasn&#8217;t noticably dodging the issue of ID requirements to travel (they cite restricting access to areas of the airport, not restricting your ability to travel), then it would simply state they were moving to require IDs.  No need to invoke the 4 horsemen of terror if the move was rational and justified.</p>

				<p>For some reason, creating the American version of Nazi occupied France seems to be the aim of our Department of Homeland Security.  The elephant in the room is that there is no credible threat &#8211; they are simply creating a police state because they can.</p>

				<p>I had no idea that you could fly without an id. I thought that was one of the first changes with the first patriot act. The current requirement of lying or having an id is a bit ridiculous. I&#8217;d rather they made it impossible to fly without id, or not require one at all.</p>
<p>Maybe they could improve the system by also requiring passengers without id to solve three minute mysteries. That way we ensure only very clever terrorists will succeed, instead of just those that can lie.</p>

				<p>I was waiting to see you weigh in on this Mr. S, and your post has the links that show me &#8220;you&#8217;ve already commented before&#8221; &#8211; and really, nothing has changed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a sad state of affairs. I think the standard line will now be to &#8220;I seem to have misplaced it. I had it, I took it out of my wallet to make sure I had it before I left home. Now I can&#8217;t find it. &#8221; &#8211; and conveniently put it in the paperback as a bookmark or something. <em>Shrug</em></p>
<p>Thanks for keeping watch Mr. S. 😉</p>

				<p>The way they are getting around this is that flying isn&#8217;t the <em>only</em> way of transportation in the country. You can take your personal car, a bus, train, horse or even walk if you like. I hear rickshaw travel is popular this time of year&#8230;.</p>
<p>I actually sat down today and read the Gilmore decision paper. The summary above was what I got from it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t agree with the paper, but i can see why his case was dismissed.</p>
<p>He cited a number of different things as being unconstitutional. He said he was denied: Freedom to travel, freedom to associate and was unable to petition the government for a redress of grievances.<br />
He also said he was subject to an un-reasonable search as outlined in the 4th amendment&#8230;</p>
<p>The court said all of the reasons he cited were actually the best rebuttal to his argument.</p>

				<p>Huh. I fly all the time, and TSA always demands ID. In fact, I have an INSPASS, the US gov issued ID, that TSA will sometimes accept and sometimes refuse. When they refuse it, I try to stand my ground, go through layers of supervisors, etc., until they either accept it or deny boarding &#8212; in which case I pull out my driver&#8217;s license, which I hate using, or a passport. I can&#8217;t imagine being let through with NO ID. Is that really possible?</p>

				<p>Yes, it is quite true that you don&#8217;t NEED an ID to fly.  They just make you go through extra security.  Kind of pointless, but whatever.  It has been the status quo for some time.  TSA gets to keep their theatre, airlines get to protect their revenue, and conscientious objectors get to opt-out.</p>
<p>This new ruling is downright disturbing.  If you assert your rights, you get the boot to the neck.  If you play dumb and smile, they pat you down and you breeze on through.  It basically endorses the most primitive methods of social engineering.</p>
<p>My thinking is that these rules come from people who assume that all previous decisions are rational and correct.  They are honestly trying to improve the system and close down holes they see.  Unfortunately, they vigorously guard the main entrance while the service entrance is propped open with a cinder block and the security camera is shrouded with a nicotine fog.</p>

<p>This may be a surprise to you, but some of us actually have reasons to travel outside of our country of residence, and are even bold enough to consider traveling to other continents. In most of these cases, there is no viable option other than air travel. If I&#8217;m planning to visit my relatives who live on an island over 10K miles away, I don&#8217;t think any of the options you listed will allow me to reach my destination.</p>

				<p>Wait&#8230; if I can get through by lying about my ID, why would I tell the truth &#8211; that I am, in fact, refusing to show ID?</p>
<p>Only reason I can think of is political speech.  With no chance of putting anyone at risk, congress (and agencies created by the congress) do not have the power to act against you in retaliation for your speech.  Flagrantly illegal.</p>

				<p>Can I just ask, what &#8220;powers&#8221; do the TSA actually have? I see they can detain you, question you, probe into your life (and your body). How come they are allowed to do this? They are not the police. This kind of thing would not happen in a supermarket, so why is it allowed to happen in airports? What&#8217;s so special about airports anyway?</p>

				<p>Is it about security or about control? When the TSA employees have more control, then they feel safer themselves, so they assume that everyone is safer. After all, your safety is their job, so if they have more control, you must be safer, right? No? Huh.</p>

				<p>i don&#8217;t understand why Bruce thinks this is about control, not security. he says, &#8220;I feel well-protected against terrorists who can&#8217;t lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>but, i thought Bruce was all about avoiding reliance on id, and instead emphasizing an assessment of danger based on other factors like behavior.</p>
<p>if anything, the only passengers who stand a chance of being properly scrutinized are those who do NOT present ids.</p>
<p>why is this new policy even interesting?</p>
<p>i&#8217;m used to Bruce complaining about over reliance on ids, not scrutiny of those who lack ids.</p>
<p>so now a terrorist without an id is more likely to be denied entrance, not less so.</p>
<p>the main security threat continues to be over reliance on (possibly faked) ids, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

				<p>@ confused</p>
<p>The concern is that, however much effort is spent protecting a non-existent threat, that much less effort is spent protecting against real threats.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re providing our own diversions and ruses to confuse our security forces and keep them busy checking for problems which don&#8217;t exist.  We don&#8217;t require firefighters to check each home and each room to make sure it isn&#8217;t on fire every hour of the day; we just want them to go where someone has reasonably decided there might be a fire.</p>

				<p>Exactly how does having ID reduce the chance that a random person is going to blow up the plane by means of a cunning device constructed from plastic forks, paper napkins and the contents of an airline lunch?</p>
<p>The non-terrorists obviously are nothing to worry about.  Real terrorists will either have no history and so cannot be detected as a threat; or will have perfectly clean papers from a friendly government and cannot be detected as a threat.</p>
<p>So, demanding ID is a pointless exercise that annoys the vast majority of passengers for  no useful reason.</p>
<p>Why the TSA is obsessed with ID is curious but probably explained under the general rule&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something must be done; this is something, so it must be done.&#8221;</p>

				<p>You actually can travel internationally without ID: inside the so called &#8220;Schengen space&#8221; in European union the borders can be crossed without any control. I can drive from Belgium to Italy through Luxembourg, Germany and France without never beeing asked any paper (from Germany to Luxembourg, short of a sign along the road, you don&#8217;t even know you crossed a border).</p>

				<p>Owthings: You are absolutely right, of course&#8211;though I believe that officially, you are required to have an ID with you when you are abroad, even in most &#8220;Schengen countries&#8221;. Normally, no one will ask you for it, but I mostly take it along, just to be on the safe side.</p>

				<p>@Owthings: in practical terms I think one could drive from the Arctic ocean (Norway) to the Mediterranean (Italy/Spain) without anybody asking for ID, since the Scandinavian passport-free zone and the Schengen space overlap. If one manages to land in either zone, almost all of Europe is reachable without border controls. I, for example, recently drove from Finland to Sweden (at Tornio/Haparanda) and could not tell where the border was. My friend knew it and pointed it out. There&#8217;s not even a sign that says &#8220;Sverige&#8221;. The telltale signs begin at the next roundabout where the road signs are slightly different and the gas stations advertise in Swedish currency.</p>
<p>&#8230;oh, and @One of three: from now on, when it comes in handy, I will also be your brother&#8230;</p>

				<p>@Owthings: another thing &#8211; a Schengen resident is technically required to carry a government issued photo ID (such as an EU driver&#8217;s license or a passport) for international travel within the Schengen space. Additionally, member countries may perform identity checks as per their respective legislation. (I think at least France requires that people be able to produce ID on request.)</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s quite simple, and it&#8217;s a sensible policy from their perspective.  There&#8217;s no point putting the squeeze on people who have lost their ID.  No blood from a stone.<br />
However, people who simply refuse to provide it can be pressured into compliance.</p>

				<p>The 9/11ers had ID and were co-operative.</p>
<p>So instead the TSA should ask<br />
&#8220;Are you a terrorist?&#8221; (Y/N)<br />
&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; (Y/N)<br />

				<p>Your question is a non-sequitur &#8211; the real question is what value does requiring ID add?  Why expend resources on something that does not add value?</p>
<p>One might as well ask why it would be a violation of civil liberties for the TSA to write down the hair color of each passenger.  Hair color, like ID, is irrelevant to intent and intent is all that matters with respect to airline security.</p>

				<p>IDs themselves don&#8217;t give away any real information, but an ID has one and only one purpose: to /identify/ you, so that authority-types can /look up information about you in their giant databases/.  Whether you&#8217;re on a no-fly list, whether you purchased a ticket from the airline or from a third-party, whether there are warrants for your arrest, whether you payed your taxes on time last year, whether your traveling companion is your spouse, who you supported in the last election, whether you&#8217;ve ever signed any petitions or attended any demonstrations for or against a particular issue, what your religion is.</p>
<p>The mere existence of an ID may or may not be a civil liberties issue, but every possible use of one is, so it&#8217;s reasonable and right to get concerned about civil liberties whenever IDs are mentioned.</p>

				<p>Unbelievable.  I can&#8217;t believe how many people actually think they are intelligent, yet say things like &#8220;America is like Nazi Germany&#8221; and &#8220;shAIRia&#8221; law.</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t some of you get off your duffs and put your supposed intellectual superiority to use and save the day?  Wait, just like the Monday morning quarterbacks, you&#8217;re only good when you aren&#8217;t responsible for anything&#8211;free to cricitize since you live in America (that you compare to Nazi Germany), but safe from scrutiny since you never actually have to do anything.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to the topic.  First, people cannot hardly do anything without an ID.  I don&#8217;t see what the big deal is for an ID requirement.  Most people here would advocate IDing someone to use their own credit card or checkbook.  I certainly would feel much safer knowing that security knew who was on a plane.  Most people would if they were thinking clearly (I&#8217;m no fan of bush, but I&#8217;m not so clouded by hatred of the man that I look for anything stupid to whine about).</p>
<p>Second, making it illegal to ID someone is probably judicial activism that they have no business engaging in.  Any supporters are probably the same people who would want to know why &#8220;the dots weren&#8217;t connected&#8221; after the fact.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been to over a dozen countries, and I&#8217;ve been IDed at every one of them.  Yet, the one that gets the most grief for it is the USA (because everyone hates us, unless of course they need help, then we&#8217;re the first nation that gets called.)</p>
<p>I shouldn&#8217;t allow myself to get pulled into rants like this.</p>

				<p>Jeff, yes you are ranting. Criticizing where it is warranted does not make us any less American or less concerned about the safety of air travel.</p>
<p>It is good to heap scorn on ineffective laws. Kindly look at penetration rates through airport security before and after these ineffective TSA mandates?</p>
<p>This &#8220;willful refusal is wrong but forgetting an ID is premissible&#8221; does nothing beyond harassing a &#8216;conscientious&#8217; objector. It makes no difference to the real threat. That was the point behind Schneier&#8217;s post.</p>

				<p>I think I&#8217;d be more alright with it if people just admitted it has nothing to do with security.</p>
<p>so the identity verification questions are about addresses?  Couldn&#8217;t you just use one of the many search engines that query public records to gather that before heading to the airport?  You can then impersonate someone.  Zaba Search anyone?</p>

<p>The new regulation makes total sense to me.  This way they don&#8217;t have to deal with people wasting their time trying to make some political statement; the security personal get just point to the rule and move on.</p>

				<p>Interesting stuff.</p>
<p>By the way, as to Bruce&#8217;s statement that &#8220;the ID requirement has nothing to do with security, and everything to do with control.&#8221;:</p>

-image/video sharing<br />
-email service providers</p>
<p>&#8230;are located on NSA&#8217;s servers?</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent point. But how much more time could be saved by<br />
simply not screwing around with this particular checking at all? You&#8217;d<br />
save all the time of checking concientious objectors AND all the time<br />
of checking everyone else. Plus, you wouldn&#8217;t have degraded real<br />
security because (excepting lists of enumerated badness that we all<br />
know are the wrong approach to security) knowing who someone is<br />
doesn&#8217;t tell you their intent or whether they&#8217;re a threat. And even<br />
that assumes that IDs tell you who someone is, which is true for<br />
the non-threats, but probably not true for the real threats.</p>
<p>Also, if concientious objectors are taking up so much of the TSA&#8217;s<br />
time, perhaps the TSA should look to address the cause of their<br />
collective objections instead of trying to simply quash it. Choosing<br />
to quash objection rather than address it openly runs contrary to<br />
American ideals of freedom, and sounds chillingly like a<br />
totalitarian regime.</p>

&#8220;Homeland Security, ID and tickets please&#8221; (TSA is part of &#8220;Department of Homeland Security&#8221;.)<br />
Pray tell, what is the difference? Papers are now required for internal travel.<br />
@Kilian: How about: &#8220;Vaterland Politzei, papieren bitte&#8221;?!?! Your &#8220;Geheimstatz&#8221; (&#8220;Geheimstadt&#8221; translates as &#8220;secret city&#8221;), doesn&#8217;t seem to translate via &#8220;Google translator&#8221;, even though it &#8220;detects&#8221; as being &#8220;German&#8221;!!! &#8220;Any way you slice it&#8221;, it sucks to live in a budding police state, imagine how much it&#8217;s going to suck when the &#8220;security&#8221; becomes even &#8220;tighter&#8221;!!!</p>

				<p>With TSA&#8217;s Amazing ability to catch terrorists a total of ZERO in four years. &#8216;And their ever increasing total of 400 plus employees fired for stealing from Passengers, including one employee connected to $800 thousand in passenger property theft. TSA has not proven itself in any way as a valuable organization.<br />
Instead they have terrorized hundreds of thousands with searches and invasion of privacy. They have permanently damages children&#8217;s faith in their parents as protectors at the same time.</p>

				<p>No one has mentioned this:  They check the databases and no-fly lists when your ticket is purchased.  They insist on ID when entering the secure zone to ensure you are the same person they have already screened through the ticketing process.</p>

				<p>Use a passport card &#8212; it does not include your address.  If the TDC rejects it, call over the LTSO or STSO immediately &#8212; and record the TDC&#8217;s info for filing a complaint.</p>

				<p>I have flown without ID, once.  Left my driver&#8217;s license at home.  Got patted down very throughly, but did still get to fly.  Now I have TSA pre&#8230;.though since I have a metal hip, I can&#8217;t escape a pat down if all they have is a magnetic scanner.</p>

				<p>have a Michigan EDL (no star but has US flag).  Was flying out of BTW last month and asked every TSA about my license.  Most of them never even heard of an EDL.  I hope they train agents better.</p>

				<p>&#8220;\&#8221;This kind of thing would not happen in a supermarket, so why is it allowed to happen in airports? What&#8217;s so special about airports anyway?\&#8221;</p>
<p>I believe you know what&#8217;s so special about airports and plains as opposed to supermarkets. &#8221;</p>
<p>There are supermarkets on the plains, &amp; the hills, &amp; the mountains.  Why should one be special?</p>
