		<h2 class="entry">Using a File Erasure Tool Considered Suspicious</h2>
		<p>By a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-fi-consumer6-2008jul06,0,325447.story">California court</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The designer, Carter Bryant, has been accused by Mattel of using Evidence Eliminator on his laptop computer just two days before investigators were due to copy its hard drive.</p>
<p>Carter hasn&#8217;t denied that the program was run on his computer, but he said it wasn&#8217;t to destroy evidence. He said he had legitimate reasons to use the software.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>But the wiper programs don&#8217;t ensure a clean getaway. They leave behind a kind of digital calling card.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only do these programs leave a trace that they were used, they each have a distinctive fingerprint,&#8221; Kessler said. &#8220;Evidence Eliminator leaves one that&#8217;s different from Window Washer, and so on.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the kind of information that can be brought up in court. And if the digital calling card was left by Evidence Eliminator, it could raise some eyebrows, even if the wiper was used for the most innocent of reasons.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have often recommended that people use file erasure tools regularly, especially when crossing international borders with their computers.  Now we have one more reason to use them regularly: plausible deniability if you&#8217;re accused of erasing data to keep it from the police.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Now we have one more reason to use them regularly: plausible deniability if you&#8217;re accused of erasing data to keep it from the police.&#8221;</p>
<p>So why not just store the data in a hidden volume in TrueCrypt?</p>
<p>Even when the outer volume is mounted, it is impossible to prove<br />
whether there is a hidden volume within it or not, because free space on any TrueCrypt volume is<br />
always filled with random data when the volume is created and no part of the (dismounted) hidden<br />
volume can be distinguished from random data.</p>
<p>No need to erase anything.</p>

				<p>Well, the article says that, depending on the progam (or on the program&#8217;s name) he would face different consequences. That is the disturbing part.</p>
<p>Best hopes for that being just a case of bad journalism.</p>

				<p>If use of an eraser is suspicious, then so is use of TrueCrypt.</p>
<p>Just have a legitimate reason to store some big files, enough to fill the disk. Kind of gives new meaning to the phrase &#8220;in the clear&#8221;.</p>
<p>For bonus points, forge some saved email, then delete it: love notes from a pop star, a discreet message from the opposing attorney (first name only) soliciting/offering a bribe, heartfelt thanks and a pledge of indebtedness from a local mob boss for that thing with the guy, be creative!</p>

				<p>@1915b0nd: So why not just store the data in a hidden volume in TrueCrypt?</p>
<p>Because even if the file is stored in a hidden volume, if you open it in almost any program temporary files and other traces containing its contents may be left on the main volume of the hard drive. You still need to get rid of those.</p>
<p>You also need to get rid of any file histories that include paths (&#8220;Mr. Smith, can you explain this file, deepsecrets.doc, and where this drive z: is that the file is listed on?&#8221;).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m more interested in the traces the file erasers leave on the machine. Is there a good summary of this issue anywhere?</p>

				<p>I wonder what kind of fingerprint would it leave if I simply DBAN the whole disk?</p>
<p>But if this continues, soon they will jail everyone who uses Linux &#8211; it&#8217;s a hacker tool, anyway.</p>

				<p>remember, this is &#8220;You destroyed evidence 2 days before the subpoena arrived&#8221;.</p>
<p>So unless you already have a well maintained history, of course it will be suspicious.</p>

				<p>It seems that if they found traces of EE on the machine, it means the guy ran and then uninstalled EE. Otherwise they would have just said EE was on the machine.</p>
<p>Someone needs to write a program called &#8220;EE Eliminator&#8221;, to remove all traces that EE has been on the machine&#8230;</p>

				<p>I vote sloppy reporting, on both the technical and legal issues.</p>
<ol>
<li>This is a civil case still in discovery, not a criminal case. No one is going to jail here.</li>
<li>It looks like the plaintiff has accused a defendant&#8217;s witness of failing to produce documents under a discovery motion. If so, at this point the plaintiff can go to the judge and get an order compelling disclosure of the data if they can convince the judge that such an order is warranted.</li>
<li>The judge has wide latitude in determining whether the defendant&#8217;s witness has deliberately interfered with discovery. If the judge believes the witness used the wipe program <em>because of</em> the discovery motion, it is perfectly appropriate for the judge to sanction the defendant or the witness.</li>
<li>Similarly, should this go to trial, the judge may choose to allow the litigants to argue the importance of this event and let a jury decide whether it matters, and if so, how much.</li>
</ol>
<p>It would be helpful if the article said specifically what phase this trial is in, and what the judge said about the wipe, instead of just reporting the plaintiff&#8217;s allegations.</p>

				<p>A good way to create and read encrypted communications is to transfer the cypher text (only cypertext) back and forth from your windows (e-mail) computer to a DOS computer (dos 3.3 was a good solid one).</p>
<p>I wonder if the next version of Windows (Windows 7 ?) will remove the ability to read and write to the FAT file-system which will prevent people from doing this?</p>
<p>DOS does not write these temp files and swap files like Windows &amp; Linux do.</p>

				<p>Won&#8217;t it be enough if you just download a big chunk of &#8216;harmless&#8217; data just to fill the space (like all the movie trailers in the apple site, or a GNU/Linux repository, or all the free apps from a download site, etc&#8230;)?</p>
<p>I mean, the empty space is effectively overwritten with that data, isn&#8217;t it?, How much data can a recovery tool recover from the empty space if there is no free space to look at? (and if there is some kind of memory effect on the magnetic disk surface, well: rinse and repeat with different data).</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it, no trace of bad data, neither evidence of the use of a file erasure tool.</p>

				<p>I periodically zero free space on my hard drives.  I develop software (primarily for my own use), and have occasionally shot myself in the foot.</p>
<p>By zeroing free space at a &#8220;known good&#8221; point, I have been able to recover (otherwise unrecoverable) data, while minimizing false positives.  This reduces the recovery process from days to hours.</p>
<p>I started using the technique about 10 years ago.  I have benefited from it twice in the intervening years.</p>
<p>Considering the use of this type of tool suspicious, is like considering the possession of a scalpel by a surgeon suspicious.  In other words, it&#8217;s a lowest common denominator type of thinking: &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand/need this, so you don&#8217;t either&#8221;.</p>

				<p>Evidence Eliminator doesn&#8217;t do a very good job eliminating evidence. Had a memory failure mess up a drive master file table here and had to get the Ontrack Data recovery tool. The file names recovered would have been good enough evidence to fire the guy for misappropiating company time in addition to not making proper backups after he had adamantly requested a CD-RW drive for that supposed purpose and then proceeded to not use it for such.</p>

				<p>It is suspicious specifically because of its timing.  If there is a documented procedure of &#8220;wiping certain files and free space every Friday&#8221; or something like that, then he has no problems at all.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it will be up to the courts to determine his intent.</p>

				<p>The linked article does not actually say that the court itself considers the choice of software suspicious. It sounds merely like the plaintiff has presented evidence that the guy&#8217;s hard disk has been wiped, in an attempt to convince the judge/jury that foul play has been afoot.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know yet whether the attempt has been successful; the jury trial is still ongoing according to the website of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (case no CV04-09049-SGL, presided over by the presumedly honorable Stephen G. Larson).</p>
<p>Without anything pointing to the contrary, it seems unlikely that the court has yet commented on the strength of the file-wiping evidence.</p>

				<p>&#8220;So what is the difference between me wiping my financial files or a company purchasing a shredder and shredding unneeded office documents? This is ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not a lot, apparently: <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_12_30/ai_96892308#" rel="nofollow ugc">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_12_30/ai_96892308#</a><br />
&#8220;WHEN THE ENRON SCANDAL WAS heating up, two accountants at Arthur Andersen worried about memos and records that could implicate the firm. Suspecting a coming investigation, they geared up an existing company policy of destroying all documents not directly related to the final audit report. Soon, the company was shredding documents and deleting e-mails right and left.</p>
<p>That was a phenomenally bad idea. Investigators didn&#8217;t buy the explanation that the firm was merely following its own document-retention policy. Whatever trouble the firm might have faced over turning a blind eye to the financial shell games played by its biggest client, destroying evidence made it far worse. The Justice Department indicted the firm for obstruction of justice. Clients fled, and one of the five biggest accounting firms in the world essentially died. There&#8217;s a lesson in this for businesses large and small.&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;So what is the difference between me wiping my financial files or a company purchasing a shredder and shredding unneeded office documents? This is ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no difference. That&#8217;s the point. If I am being investigated for something and suddenly and unexpectedly purchase a shredder, shred a bunch of stuff, and then sell the shredder, there is going to be a lot of &#8220;intent&#8221; questions on the legal side. This case is no different.</p>
<p>&#8220;2. Does possession of a paper shredder mean intent to conceal a crime?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, if you have one and regularly use it. But if you suddenly purchase one, in the middle of an investigation that you know about, there are going to be a lot of questions.</p>
<p>I think this is a classic case of an idiot reporter talking about technology and law, when he knows nothing about either. (I&#8217;m not saying that I know much about law, but I know enough about it to realize that it operates differently from technology)</p>

				<p>I often wonder with the American Justice system of plea bargining just how much the process effects the investigation&#8230;</p>
<p>For instance I think most here would agree that, although wiping files, defraging etc are legitimate activities and some consider them a sensible policy to maintain system stability etc, it would be very easy for a prosecutor to &#8220;bambozol&#8221; a jury into beliving it is suspicious activity.</p>
<p>As most of us have found out in the past it is difficult to prove a &#8220;negative&#8221; to our peers let alone those not of our field of endevour. And a jury is almost certainly not going to be sufficiently clued up to make a proper value judgment.</p>
<p>Therefor a prosecutor can use it as a method to bring pressure on a defendant be they technicaly knowledgeable or not. The prosecuter just has to point out that the jury will belive that it was an attempt to destroy evidence as there is no proof otherwise, and there for the defendent should take an offer&#8230;</p>

				<p>@Clive;</p>
<p>By the time the prosecutor has gotten the case, the investigation is over, the trial has already begun.</p>
<p>The prosecutor can&#8217;t &#8220;bamboozle&#8221; the jury, he only gets to talk directly to the jury twice, during opening and closing arguments. Other than those two times, the only thing he can do is ask questions of witnesses and experts. He can ask loaded questions to get one-sided answers, but remember that any witness/expert can be cross-examined and testimony rebutted. If the jury is &#8220;bamboozled&#8221;, it&#8217;s probably the fault of the defense for not doing a good enough job &#8220;unbamboozling&#8221; the jury.</p>
<p>The prosecutor isn&#8217;t going to offer a plea deal unless there is a risk that the jury is going to vote to acquit. If a prosecutor comes up to you, in the middle of the trial, and says the jury will find you guilty of the crime&#8230; but we can make a deal &#8230; then you should laugh and decline because you know their case is falling apart. It makes no sense for the prosecution to offer a deal if they are sure the jury will convict.</p>
<p>Now, before the trial, the District Attorney&#8217;s office can offer a deal to a suspect. But note that at this point, there is no prosecutor and no defendant since the trial has not yet begun.</p>

				<p>Are there any erasure tools that will clear the unused space in a Windows swap file?  I&#8217;ve tried simply writing zeroes to it from a dual-booted operating system &#8212; the next time you boot, Windows will say the swap file is corrupt and you have to rebuild it.</p>

				<p>A comment to TrueCrypt: While it is impossible to ID it from the data found on this, it is actually very easy to itdentify strong randomness. It is a bit more difficult to identify it as cryptographically strong. Some non-crypto generators are pretty good. So unless you use a wipe software that uses cryptographically strong randomness in its last write, there will be pretty good evidence of encrypted data on your drive and you may have trouble explaining that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, here is the procedure I use for wiping disks: Mount under Linux with dm-crypt and a random password. Then overwrite with random data from a fast PRNG (non-crypto). This is indistinguishable from an encrypted volume without breaking the crypto. Guess I have some suspicuous disks lying around now&#8230;.</p>

				<p>TrueCrypt leaves lots of hints in your registry. For instance, if you mount your TC volume to the same drive letter every time, say X:, search your registry for X:/ entries. There will be recent files lists, AV messages, executable paths, etc. Your Event Viewer messages may also refer to the X:/ drive, as well as the AV logfiles. And those are three places you can easily look. I&#8217;m sure there are others less obvious.</p>

				</p>

				<p>&#8220;If you used an external harddrive, would that work?&#8221;</p>
<p>Not for hiding the clues. Your registry still records the drive letter you use to mount the drive. You <em>could</em> use a different drive letter every time and really send them looking, but the recent file names will still be visible as will the anti-virus logfiles.</p>
<p>You could also use something like Deep Freeze on your OS and keep your data on an external drive. Once you&#8217;ve done whatever to your files, unmount the TC drive or partition and then reboot, letting Deep Freeze set everything back to square one in the OS. But I wouldn&#8217;t want to run a serious production workstation that way.</p>

				<p>A possible problem with using TrueCrypt is if you keep image backups of the encrypted volume. A comparison of a backup with the current volume will show that some of the apparently unused blocks filled with random-seeming info have changed and have different random seeming info. This indicates that a hidden volume is in use i.e. it is not hidden any more.</p>
<p>I have not checked this. A countermeasure would be for TrueCrypt to change unused blocks anyway &#8211; but this would require knowing if a hidden volume were in place, so the hidden volume would have to be mounted <em>every</em> time you used the TrueCrypt volume, which may not be what you want.</p>
<p>TrueCrypt is not the panacea some people think it is.</p>

IIRC, it is now a crime in the UK to forget the passwords to your encrypted data, in a situation where the legal system wants to see it. (Yes, I know that&#8217;s ridiculous.) This is an advantage of the plausibly deniable encrypted filesystems.</p>

An open-source program called eraser, available from SourceForge, claims to sanitize the Windows swap file (you might have to run it from DOS).<br />

				<p>Now everything&#8217;s suspicious! delete a file means you (bad guy) want to hide something then DBAN your whole disk and probably you win a pass for Guantanamo! (@david : sorry 😉<br />
I do use Linux, GPG, SSH and DBAN. Sure I&#8217;am a very bad guy&#8230; Actually, I don&#8217;t know EE but I wonder how it&#8217;s possible to install such a tool on Mattel&#8217;s Laptop, especially if the system is hardened to be compliant with internal security policy.</p>

				<p>For people worried about swap partitions under Unix, note that OpenBSD automatically (&amp; completely transparently) encrypts the swap partition.   (The encryption keys are kept in kernel memory, and periodically rotated.)  This feature has existed as an option for many years, and has been turned on by default for about 3 years now.  See <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/papers/swapencrypt.ps" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.openbsd.org/papers/swapencrypt.ps</a> for details.</p>

				<p>There&#8217;s also Sdelete by Mark Russinovich of Microsoft, formally of SysInternals. It&#8217;s a Microsoft provided tool and a little more nicely named&#8230; secure delete.  We all want to be secure.

				<p>drawing a conclusion this would probably mean that every unix-like OS (i.e. Linux, Mac OS X,&#8230;) could be suspicious 😉<br />
You can easily overwrite unused disk space simply reading from /dev/random or /dev/zero</p>
<p>&#8211;&gt; cat /dev/random &gt; /path/to/your/volume</p>
<p>This creates a steadily growing file (until all free space is used up) with either &#8216;0&#8217;s or random data.</p>

				<p>Well, this just reminds me of the outcome of the Arthur Anderson ruling:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/31/AR2005053100491.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/31/AR2005053100491.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;As a result of the faulty instructions, the justices ruled, the firm was convicted without proof that its shredding of documents was deliberately intended to undermine a looming Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry in fall 2001. U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon should have instructed the jury that the law required the government to prove that Andersen knew it was breaking the law, the court ruled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently if you want to destroy a suspect, charge them with shredding or wiping&#8230;</p>

				<p>Sorry, should have included this bit from the article cited above</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, it is striking how little culpability the [judge&#8217;s] instructions required,&#8221; Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote in the opinion for the court. &#8220;For example, the jury was told that, &#8216;even if [Andersen] honestly and sincerely believed that its conduct was lawful, you may find [it] guilty.&#8217; &#8221;</p>

				<p>I&#8217;d just point out that cleaning your car can be considered incriminating under suitable circumstances &#8211; e.g. if the cleaning occured between 2am, when a car very much like yours was seen fleeing a murder scene, and 4am, when the police turned up at your place with a search warrant.</p>

				<p>Here&#8217;s a useful tip. I&#8217;ve used this tool many times since it&#8217;s integrated into Windows XP and probably on Vista too. I&#8217;m talking about cipher.exe. The tool can be used to securely overwrite random data on the disk on those areas that are marked as empty on the file allocation table. The pros:<br />
-Exists on most windows platforms and can be used with normal user access rights (no admin required)<br />
-Very secure, overwrites empty space three times with 0000&#8217;s FFFF&#8217;s and pseudorandom data<br />
-Intended to be used when a deleted data should stay deleted</p>
<p>The cons:<br />
-Does not clean your registry, empty your trash can, clean windows page file, do your dishes or take out the trashes. It&#8217;s not magic but it&#8217;s still good.</p>
<p>Usage:<br />
From command prompt, type:<br />
cipher.exe /W:c:\</p>

				<p>The program is called &#8220;evidence eliminator&#8221;. If would be far less troublesome if it was called windows washer (which is cheaper).</p>
<p>And the trouble with all plausible deniabilty always is that they can always accuse you of doing something bad.</p>

				<p>Look, people; it&#8217;s so easy:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why yes, I do use file-erasure technology on my laptop &#8212; daily, automatically &#8212; and so should everybody who travels. For example, you get one of those spam emails with a picture of a naked lady doing things to herself with a battery-operated device. Now, imagine, for instance, that this email was sitting in your inbox when you computer is examined at the airport of some Islamic country where you could go to jail for for smuggling pornography and &#8220;corrupting morals&#8221; or whatever excuse the corrupt flunkies need to just seize another sweet, late-model laptop.</p>
<p>Even if you delete the email, the picture is still sitting on your hard-drive and will remain there until it is overwritten by new data. But if you have a 500gb hard-drive, and only use about 100gb of it &#8212; that could take a long, long, long time. Anybody running a sector-scanning file-recovery tool could find it weeks, months, maybe years later.&#8221;</p>

				<p>Hello, Mr. Schneier!</p>
<p>May I humbly ask you to elaborate on your concerns regarding the security of TrueCrypt&#8217;s hidden volumes?</p>
<p>I am deeply interested in all things cryptographic, though I neither work in the field nor directly depend on products involving cryptography (well, except maybe for an occasional SSL session). I may even call cryptography my &#8220;hobby&#8221;.</p>
<p>Because of this interest I would like to educate myself on some of the less obvious (not described in the pretty detailed TrueCrypt documentation file) potential vulnerabilities that might be present in TC&#8217;s hidden volume feature.</p>
<p>Your help in this endeavor would be very appreciated.</p>
<p>-Sincerely,<br />
    Vasili Ogilbah</p>

<p>Gone are the days when hard drives had stickers with easy access to the platters, for custom add ons.</p>
<p>The rusting of a hard drive platter, sounds like drive activity, little popping sounds.  Makes you think of these platters as speakers. Considering the recent Schneier article on keyboards and lasers, I wonder if a soundcard/mic on a hard drive to be another unique hollywood style exploit.</p>
