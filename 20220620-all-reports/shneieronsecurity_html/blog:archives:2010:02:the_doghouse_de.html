		<h2 class="entry">The Doghouse: Demiurge Consulting</h2>
		<p>They claim to be &#8220;one of the nation&#8217;s only and most respected security and intelligence providers&#8221; &#8212; I&#8217;ve never heard of them &#8212; but their <a href="http://www.demiurgeconsulting.com/blog/page/8/">blog</a> consists entirely of entries copied from my blog since December 24.  They don&#8217;t even cull the ones that are obviously me: <a href="http://www.demiurgeconsulting.com/2009/12/me-and-the-christmas-underwear-bomber/">posts about</a> interviews I&#8217;ve given, for example.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.demiurgeconsulting.com/contact-us/">contacted them</a> last week and asked that they stop stealing my blog posts.  I got an apologetic e-mail in response from Karim Hijazi, whose email sig file identifies him as &#8220;Principal/Founder,&#8221; but nothing has happened since.  They haven&#8217;t stolen any new posts, but they haven&#8217;t taken down the old ones either.  I suppose I could sue them, but public ridicule seems more fitting.  (If you&#8217;re reading this post on the Demiurge site, I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.schneier.com">Bruce Schneier</a>.  Hi.)</p>
<p>EDITED TO ADD (2/23):  The blog posts are down, and there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.demiurgeconsulting.com/2010/02/interesting-response-from-schneier/">message</a> to me in its place:</p>
<blockquote><p>Speaking to the team that handles the blog component of the Demiurge website, I have learned not only have they been able to find at least 23 other websites syndicating content from Mr. Schneier’s blog, but there are more than three websites offering full blog post syndication links including Schneier’s blog.</p>
<p>Further, why would you find it offensive if we find your content very interesting to our clientele? If we really were trying to make it look like our content, don’t you think we would have scrubbed it? Besides all the links went back to your bloody blog… just more viewers for you. You weren’t thinking when you tried to flame us Bruce.</p>
<p>All you had to do was ask us to stop syndicating, which we did.</p></blockquote>
<p>And for completeness, here&#8217;s Hijazi&#8217;s original e-mail response to my request: &#8220;Please stop stealing my blog posts and republishing them as your own.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Please accept my apologies about the republishing of your blog posts.<br />
Quite honestly our web development team was tasked with finding some interesting content to keep the blog component of our firm&#8217;s website compelling and up to date; it is clear that they took my request out of context.  Ironically, I rarely even look at my own firm&#8217;s website!</p>
<p>I have had them stop the republishing immediately.  I know of you by reputation, truly respect your work and thank you for being so gracious in your request; you very well could have been obtuse.</p>
<p>Again, I personally apologize for this situation.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Karim</p></blockquote>
<p>I know, I know.  But the posts are down, and that&#8217;s what matters.</p>

				<p>This is so sad it is comical.  Although if I were in your shoes I might not be laughing.  They have posted on the 1th an interview they (you &lt;- Schneier) did.</p>

<p>I know, but it seemed proper to ask them nicely first.  And this might end up on their site after all; I don&#8217;t know how often they stole my posts.  Did they do it every day?  Every week?  I have no idea.</p>

				<p>That&#8217;s very funny.  Anyone with access to CapitalIQ or such service should post info about Demiurge.  I think &#8220;demiurge&#8221; loosely translates to &#8220;half-assed.&#8221;  I note that they ran a TSA logo contest, too.</p>

				<p>I like this quote from the homepage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Demiurge Consulting can facilitate and initiate full service consultancy in the event that a key executive, employee or high net worth individual is the subject of a potential kidnap for ransom.&#8221;</p>

				<p>I really wouldn&#8217;t worry about &#8220;theft&#8221; like this.</p>
<p>1)Even if they weren&#8217;t laughably incompetent at it, anyone who became seriously interested in &#8220;their&#8221; posts would notice your blog pretty soon.<br />
2)They couldn&#8217;t duplicate the comment dialogue, which is a significant part of the draw of this blog.<br />
3) At worst, some of your ideas will reach some people anonymously whom they wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have reached at all.</p>

				<p>In the religious philosophy of the ancient Gnostics, the entity known as &#8220;God&#8221;, &#8220;the LORD&#8221;, &#8220;Jehovah&#8221;, etc. in the Bible is said to be a &#8220;demiurge&#8221;, a usurping entity inferior to the true God. The demiurge claims to be the creator, but he is not, and in fact is incapable of really creating anything. This is entirely too appropriate for this &#8220;Demiurge Consulting.&#8221; They can&#8217;t even write their own blog, all they can do is rip off Bruce and present his stuff as their own work.</p>

				<p>I hate to say this but this is what you get for not encrypting your blog.  Don&#8217;t you realize that once you put your site on the web in clear text that anybody can read it?</p>

				<p>Wow. That&#8217;s some reputation they&#8217;re building for themselves there. The Principal/Founder and anyone else  associated with the theft of your blog posts deserves the burden of that reputation.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right; they belong in the doghouse. I certainly hope they get some obedience training before they&#8217;re allowed out on a leash.</p>

				<p>It appears that he wiped the blog from his site in the last 30 minutes.  It is now blank.</p>
<p>I kinda hoped that he&#8217;d keep the blog up, as it would be a red flag to observant prospective clients that he is not to be trusted.</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s not unusual for bogus websites to copy stuff from another site. Usually they register a domain name which is similar to the real domain name of the site being plagiarized; sometimes they just rely on a google search (googling for: &#8220;security intelligence consulting&#8221; without the quotes will find the Demiurge site). The idea is to attract hits from people who confuse the &#8220;similar&#8221; domain name with the real one.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point? If the site invites entry of email addresses, harvest those. Otherwise, show visitors ads.</p>

				<p>@DK &#8211; Encrypting the blog would be way cool. It would certainly weed out the security wannabe&#8217;s (like myself)&#8230; 🙂 Of course, he could always put the key somewhere in the post in plain text, so all we would have to do is figure out the algorithm Bruce used to encrypt it. Fun!</p>

				<p>The site is a sock puppet.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a web designer, graphic artist, and brand manager.  It&#8217;s likely that he&#8217;s using this &#8220;Demiurge&#8221; site as a showcase of his work.  He&#8217;s created a web presence for this fake site using twitter, blogging, linkedin, as well as numerous other third party sites.  It&#8217;s actually pretty impressive.</p>
<p>If you go to FoxLogic Productions, he&#8217;s got a showcase of other websites.  If you don&#8217;t pay attention to any of the content, they are quite nicely done.  Problem is:<br />
gymcentric.com &#8211; All Links are for products, there is zero actual fitness content.</p>
<p>dietcentric.com &#8211; &#8220;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh.&#8221;  Yep, display only.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.originalwit.com" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.originalwit.com</a> &#8211; Nothing original&#8230;</p>
<p>and it just continues from there.</p>
<p>So the moral:  He&#8217;s trying to show off his web management and branding skills more than his security &#8216;skillz&#8217;.</p>
<p>Definitely naughty to be plagiarizing though.</p>

				<p>@Michael</p>
<p>I was just about to pour into that whole rant.</p>
<p>This is a classic case of some dumb designer / flash kid building hundreds of off-the-shelf cute-sy web sites to make himself look like some kind of experienced developer with decades of on-the-job-experience and a huge portfolio.</p>
<p>It probably wasn&#8217;t the best idea for him, being an aspiring web developer, to garner all this ill attention from the comp/security community, haha, unless he&#8217;s extremely confident in his development work 😉</p>

				<p>@Shane</p>
<p>Or maybe it was all part of the branding plan&#8230;.</p>
<p>I bet his site traffic just spiked, along with hits to his LinkedIn Profile.  And I&#8217;m not exactly sure how, but he&#8217;s connected to members of the Control System Cyber Security community, a very niche area of cyber security.  How he got there, I have no idea.</p>
<p>When I go entrepreneur, I may actually give him a call.</p>

				<p>From the department of people who don&#8217;t get it&#8230; from their front page:</p>
<p>&#8220;Further, why would you find it offensive if we find your content very interesting to our clientele? If we really were trying to make it look like our content, don’t you think we would have scrubbed it? Besides all the links went back to your bloody blog… just more viewers for you. You weren’t thinking when you tried to flame us Bruce.&#8221;</p>

				<p>He apparently doesn&#8217;t know much about copyright.  That sounds like more of a liability than a web developer.</p>
<p>Maybe we should all call to tell him how copyright works:<br />

<p>I wonder if he &#8220;syndicates&#8221; copies of Microsoft Windows, and FrontPage too&#8230;.  Or Big Studio movies and music.  Probably.  Call up the BSA, MPAA, RIAA.  BRING THE HAMMER DOWN!</p>

				<p>@Bruce:</p>
<p>You should have written this post before you contacted them, sha1summed the text, and included the checksum in an unrelated post a week ago. Then today you could have revealed what the sha1 was about, and grinned, having gotten your readers to play with some (albeit pretty simple) form of crypto.</p>
<p>You could have done the same with your message to them a week ago, so their denial of it today could be refuted with evidence that existed on their own site before they ever denied it.</p>

				<p>Being the curious sort, I googled a few quoted sections to see what was being copied from where.</p>
<p>One line in the section discussing services that included executive protection was quoted almost verbatim by several security companies that I got more curious.  They all copied from wikipedia.  I guess the security services industry isn&#8217;t to be trusted about copyright.</p>
<p>Source: Executive protection &#8211; Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br />
Address : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_protection" rel="nofollow ugc">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_protection</a><br />
Protective measures may include home security systems, bodyguards, armored vehicles and vehicle scramble plans, mail screening, private jet travel, background checks for other employees, and other precautions.[2] Executive protection may also provide security for immediate and/or extended family members to prevent kidnapping and extortion.</p>

				<p>Well, he&#8217;s taken the whole demiurgeconsulting.com site down now, there&#8217;s just a black with white letters frontpage.</p>
<p>Dietcentric.com  is still up, interestingly he didn&#8217;t even bother to remove the source of this one from the bottom &#8220;Powerful WordPress Themes Design from TemplateMonster.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had a brief look at the html source in the other sites &amp; find it a little difficult to believe they were all written by the same author (or authoring tool), so I suspect the design work is largely acquiring other peoples&#8217; templates.</p>
<p>Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, as long as you have a licence to use and give credit to the original author, which I think is where we came in.</p>

<p>So, they can handle intelligence gathering, counterintelligence, pen testing, security architecture, and kidnapping but&#8230; they lack the skills to create a valid PGP certificate. With such simple mistakes, I just can&#8217;t help but feel sorry for the guy who gets kidnapped and dies because they picked the wrong replacement batteries for their cell phones, which die during the pivotal point of an already shaky negotiation.</p>

				<p>And another one for the Bruce Schneier Facts:</p>
<p>&#8220;The demiurge just copied Bruce Schneiers ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s not crypto, but obviously the physical world is controlled by the might one, Bruce.</p>
<p>[This must all be a big Schneier-controlled conspiracy. How else can you explain that someone first goes for a title like that and than so explicitly subordinates himself under someone so publicly known? Obviously Bruce himself was after some new title for himself: original author of the demiurges blueprint.]</p>

				<p>Oh Come on all&#8211;measured response.</p>
<p>How do you handle problems? At the lowest level possible. First you ask for offending material to be removed and only if they don&#8217;t THEN you escalate. Cost effective.</p>
<p>Do you want Bruce to get the same rep that the Milano&#8217;s or RIAA have? &#8216;Execution First, then the trial.&#8217; Besides I believe DCMA offendors have to be informed about the infringed material before a take down can occur.</p>
<p>That said Mr Hijazi could probably  profitablely spend time developing his consultancy&#8217;s ethical infrastructure. Likely he&#8217;s got kids out of school developing his website.</p>
<p>@Trichinosis &#8211; That! was truly funny.</p>

				<p>If one is promoting web design skills, then samples should be clearly identified as such, which was apparently not the case for the Demiurge Consulting site.</p>
<p>And the script-kiddie response isn&#8217;t exactly a smart move, either &#8211; let&#8217;s say a potential client surfed to the site and saw that. Hmm. An argument with the person whose content I lifted.</p>
<p>Above and beyond that, it would suggest to me that I direct my business to Counterpane rather than Demiurge, and that&#8217;s not because Demiurge was syndicating Bruce&#8217;s content, but because they&#8217;ve shown themselves to be irresponsible/incompetent/unethical.</p>

				<p>Haven&#8217;t any of you actually read Bruce&#8217;s post?  We can all agree that Demiurge should have asked permission to republish, but the guy responded immediately, and was complementary.</p>
<p>He has a point that there was no &#8220;scrubbing&#8221; done to the post trying to alter the content to their own.  I would be with all of you if he never got back to Bruce, claimed the content was his and didn&#8217;t have any experience in the industry, but from the looks of it, he does.</p>
<p>The guy actually checks out pretty well.  One of my buddies at Bragg said he worked with him in Dubai on some hairy stuff.</p>
<p>I can appreciate the fact the guy is entrepreneurial and has a number of things going on.  I am with Michael T:  I just might get in touch with him!</p>

<p>While Karim&#8217;s exchange with Bruce is perfectly civil, the nanny-nanny-neener response that was posted on the site is an entirely different thing.</p>
<p>Would I entrust my company&#8217;s security to a firm that seems to be hiring a bunch of ill-mannered script kiddies for their web design team? Doubtful.

				<p>Advertisements like &#8220;leading authority&#8221;, &#8220;industry leader&#8221;, and &#8220;highly respected&#8221; always leae me a chuckle.</p>
<p>When I was road tripping to Florida this month, I got a similar chuckle from billboards: &#8220;Voted Best BBQ&#8221; (more than one claimed this in the same town); &#8220;award winning ribs&#8221; (what award?); &#8220;cleanest bathrooms on I-75&#8221; (and they know this how?).</p>
<p>Then, by the grace of God, a sign for a place in Seffner, FL read: &#8220;Chinese Food.&#8221;  Which is exactly what it was.  At long last, truth in advertising.</p>

				<p>Well, there is the assumption that the site was designed by a &#8220;team&#8221; consisting of people <em>other</em> than Hijazi himself.</p>
<p>The evidence in his favour is not great and I strongly wonder where he has found time to achive his impressive array of claims &#8211; unless we are actually talking about Dr Who rather than Austin Powers.</p>
<p>As I see it: A site unethically (if not illegally) scraped content from Bruce&#8217;s blog. Bruce contacted them and asked them to stop. They responded by putting up a childish response.</p>
<p>After a lot of bad publicity the whole site seems to have condensed into a single page. There are however a few other websites about Hijazi which paint a hard to reconcile picture.</p>
<p>Whether or not Hijazi is the person who designed the site is irrelevant. A company he claims is his own has done two wrong things now and he should resolve the problem properly. If he is the Ninja Assassin Photographer he claims to be then surely he is able to manage his &#8220;web design team&#8221; in a better manner. If he has so little control over his staff that they can humiliate him in this manner I dread to think what &#8220;intelligence&#8221; work he can provide.</p>
<p>@airborne &#8211; you may well have a &#8220;buddy a Bragg&#8221; who did some &#8220;hairy stuff&#8221; with him, but it leaves open the question &#8211; when? Was Hijazi one of the Dubai hit team?</p>
<p>I cant for the life of me work out how Hijazi is on anyones side except his own.</p>

				<p>@Shane: &#8220;Haha, I&#8217;m taking a small risk at putting my foot in my mouth here, but I call bull****.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p>That&#8217;s one of the beauties of a blog like this.  Putting one&#8217;s foot in one&#8217;s mouth isn&#8217;t as bad when no one knows who you really are, and you can always change names if you do what I&#8217;m notorious for and stick both feet in your mouth.  lol.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used basically only this name for a couple years.  I changed names in 2008 or 2007 after too many name collisions and to start over with some people that I wanted a better blogging relationship with.  It&#8217;s a beautiful thing.  🙂</p>
<p>But you won&#8217;t be the only one with their foots in their mouth, I suspect BS too.</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t verify the Dubai comment but do know for a fact he (Hijazi) has had some serious talent working closely with him:</p>
<p>Patrick Stach (Optyx) &#8211; Seems he has been associated with Demiurge Consulting for years.  That&#8217;s a crypto kid and a half!  You all know Stach &amp; Liu, well he&#8217;s the Stach half.</p>
<p>David Maynor of Errata Security &#8211; I hear they are very close friends and worked a number of projects together.</p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t know about you, but this guy has me intrigued.</p>

				<p>I can vouch for Karim.</p>
<p>He and I did worked closely together years ago when I was gathering intelligence on the Joker.</p>
<p>He was also instrumental in negotiating the safe release of Bruce Wayne after he had been kidnapped for ransom by a rival corporation&#8217;s henchmen.</p>

<p>Well its a given that unscrupulous, unethical people will scrape blogs. It happens.</p>
<p>Are you saying it should be ignored because there are 700+ scrapers trying to get ad revenue from Bruce&#8217;s blog posts?</p>
<p>Or are you saying that Demiurge is legitimate because it is mirroring the tactics of unscrupulous, unethical scrapers?</p>

				<p>In reading through this post again, checking out the claims made by Hijazi (whoever he really is), and the cumulative good stuff from the comments, why am I reminded of &#8220;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&#8221;, and where <em>is</em> Terry Gilliam these days?</p>

<p>Yea, it&#8217;s hard not to be at least mildly entertained by his relentlessness.  The amount of effort he&#8217;s willing to put into keeping up the paperless-paper-trail facade he&#8217;s built for himself makes me wonder if there shouldn&#8217;t be a new term christened in the sociopathy/psychopathy vein for the purely internet-based manifestations of the disorders.</p>

				<p>@ airborne</p>
<p>A fair use statement would give you, or Karim, an idea on what you could or couldnt use the feed for. Without it you can only assume you cant use it.</p>
<p>Now, some element of &#8220;syndication&#8221; is acceptable &#8211; normally in the form of &#8220;I saw an interesting post on XYZ blog here [URL]&#8221; or a commentary on the post. You see this all the time on decent blogs (here for example).</p>
<p>Alternatively you get scrapers, which suck up the RSS feed and republish it as their own work. Often to get advertising revenue but sometimes to make it look like a bedroom outfit is a legitimate organisation with a live news service.</p>
<p>From what I can find about the Demiurge site (thanks to Google Cache and WayBackMachine) there wasnt any attempt to produce its own content. Which I find strange for a &#8220;premier intelligence&#8221; company.</p>
<p>There is no real cure to unethical people trying to pass of the work of another. However the one thing you can do when you find it happening is out the &#8220;Company&#8221; responsible to make sure they get no tangible benefit from their acts.</p>
<p>What would you suggest instead?</p>

				<p>I think the author should have come clean when Bruce emailed him.  But in this day and age, with marketing what it is, many people are looking for the viral marketing sucess.  just look at &#8220;pimp my bum.com&#8221; where people donated to help a bum get a job.</p>
<p>I think the doghouse is a perfect place for him.  I don&#8217;t think any real damage was done (other than wasting Bruce&#8217;s time), but a good thwapping with a ruler was in order!</p>
<p>How sad would it be if we just ruined some big online RPG that someone was running, making all of these sites?</p>

				<p>@Scott:</p>
<p>Well, Terry Gilliam&#8217;s latest film was The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, also known as the film that Heath Ledger was doing when he died.  Before that it was Tideland, which pretty much disappeared without a trace because distributors didn&#8217;t want to touch it.</p>
<p>He tends to be a bit of a one-man show, often writer/director/producer, so one film every three or four years or so is about all you can expect.</p>

<p>Googling for &#8220;Karim Hijazi&#8221; is amusing. There is this on SERP 8:</p>
<p>&#8220;LuxMedia Altitudes Arabia magazine presents Air Synapsis<br />
Hence its choice for the business aviation development &amp; advisory company established by Karim Hijazi, an eleven year veteran of the aviation sector with &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Which if the rest of the cruft is to believed, would mean he has been an &#8220;industry leader&#8221; since he got his driver&#8217;s license.</p>

				<p>Apparently he used to be Information Services Director at Julaiah Group.  Interesting how he still hosts their website on top of Foxlogic Productions.  Seems a bit odd to let a former employee have that kind of control over your company.</p>

				<p>@ BF Skinner, Shane,  ziesta,</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t jump to conclusions. He was being released today. Any number of things, up to and including just living in the UK could be keeping him off line.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well yes. Due to complications I did not go under the &#8220;gas&#8221; thus the &#8220;knife&#8221; today. Thus I&#8217;m in a catch 22 position of what is making me ill enough to require the surgury is also making me to ill to operate on safely.</p>
<p>Thus I have to go through a stabalisation and testing process first.</p>
<p>Thus it&#8217;s a bit like filling a bucket with holes in it with water and saying it&#8217;s good to go when the bucket overflows but not otherwise&#8230;</p>
<p>That is they know I&#8217;m going to continue to get worse unless other treatment is given, and then when I&#8217;m at an acceptable level get me under the knife quick befor I degrade to a dangerous point again.</p>
<p>However this other treatment also potentialy endangers my life and well being as much if not more than the problem they are trying to solve.</p>
<p>The trick the doctors have to do is find the &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; and hope it&#8217;s enough to get me under the knife&#8230;</p>
<p>With regards</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? I&#8217;d head to the first pub and show off my stiches for free drinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saddly I&#8217;m not alowed to enjoy the benifits of good honest beer or other fermented beverages.</p>
<p>Secondly the problem is internal and these days they tend to go for laprascopic (key hole) surgury where possible as it minimises the impact on the patient.</p>
<p>And for some (sound?) reasons the medical profesion appear to do some quite bizzar things.</p>
<p>Like to fix your heart they make a hole in your groin and shove thin tubes up you (angioplasty). And for some procedures they just use the holes that nature provides (hose pipe down your gullet or worse the opposit direction).</p>
<p>But the ultimate indignity they inflict on you when in hospital has got to be the &#8220;stockings -n- gowns&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now from what I have heard (from the nurses no less) there is a small percentage of the population that like to play doctors and nurses and some men apparently like to dress in nurses apparell.</p>
<p>But I can assure you I just do not look good in white (TED) stockings and a yellow wrap around (gown) that on me is shorter than the most daring of mini skirts and well lets just say drafty around the back.</p>
<p>Mary Quant / Twiggy I most definatly am not, and I&#8217;m not ammused by looking like a cross dressing bear, though others appear to find it takes their mind of their own problems&#8230;</p>

				<p>@BF Skinner: google of &#8220;The Doghouse: Demiurge Consulting&#8221; and retrieved over 700 hits.</p>
<p>I juste googled &#8220;and for completeness, here&#8217;s Hijazi&#8217;s e-mail response to my request&#8221; and got:<br />
&#8211; one RSS mirror <a href="http://www.xfruits.com/crowe_sec/general/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.xfruits.com/crowe_sec/general/</a><br />
&#8211; one virus injector (?) ko-kr.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=326119851775<br />
&#8211; a few RSS scrapers (calling themselves aggregators) possibly hosting ads: planet.phekda.org/ <a href="http://www.chuvakin.org/rss2html/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.chuvakin.org/rss2html/</a> <a href="http://www.ibez.ru/aggregator" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.ibez.ru/aggregator</a> risspa.ru/aggregator/categories/1 risspa.org/aggregator <a href="http://www.libertysys.com.au/aggregator" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.libertysys.com.au/aggregator</a> <a href="http://www.planetwebsecurity.org/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.planetwebsecurity.org/</a> antareja.rvs.uni-bielefeld.de/~made/reading/ <a href="http://www.politicalforum.com/political-blogs/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.politicalforum.com/political-blogs/</a> complianceandprivacy.com/blogs/Bruce-Schneier-index.html</p>
<p>@BF Skinner: I looked for a shneier acceptable/fair use statement here but i couldn&#8217;t find it.  Bruce what are your limits on redistribution?</p>
<p>Possible answer, the last RSS scraper above states that &#8220;Each blog item is reproduced from the relevant feed from the originating blog, either in full or in part as that feed itself determines.&#8221;</p>
<p>@airborne &#8220;So what now? Go after the other 700+ guilty republishers?&#8221;<br />
Ho did you (or your &#8220;colleagues&#8221; ddefense or Hijazi) count 700 republishers ?</p>
<p>@GreenSquirrel &#8220;There is no real cure to unethical people trying to pass of the work of another.&#8221;<br />
You can make an abuse complaint to providers.</p>

<p>Fair one &#8211; that would be effective for some cases but would depend heavily on who the host was.</p>
<p>They may lose that site but its easy enough to set up another one and scrape again.</p>
<p>The point I was trying to make to [airborne | sock puppet] was that all you can do is treat the symptoms. In my mind that is what Bruce did by sending an email to [Karim | Austin Powers].</p>

				<p>@airborne:</p>
<p>Actually, it doesn&#8217;t prove your point, which seems to be &#8216;anyone can syndicate Bruce, &#8217;cause it doesn&#8217;t say you can&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>
<p>If you are a &#8216;security consultant&#8217; and posting a direct syndication feed to the work of another, unaffiliated consultant whose reputation is far more verifiable than a string of vague testimonials, it is unethical by any measure.</p>
<p>It is even less palatable to then excuse the act by saying, &#8220;Well, I thought my clients would be interested,&#8221; even as your web team acts like a bunch of kids dissing an opponent in team deathmatch.</p>
<p>Finally, because the site now consists of nothing but a static title page, we can gather that Demiurge Consulting offers nothing. Take away the stuff ripped from Bruce &#8211; permissible or not &#8211; and there&#8217;s ZERO CONTENT.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ll give my business to Bruce and Counterpane.</p>

				<p>One of our first guesses that it&#8217;s a demo site &#8212; I think is wrong.</p>
<p>Looks like they are serious. AND as @GreenSquirrel notes serious about using public domain info.</p>
<p>It is a good looking site.</p>

<p>I agree &#8211; it is an attractive and apparently functional site. It strikes me that [karim|whoever] coded the site has a definite talent.</p>
<p>If I was looking for a web designer and this was a demo site, I&#8217;d be sold.</p>
<p>Sadly, if I was (weirdly) looking to contact a random &#8220;intelligence&#8221; company over the internet, and had never read this thread, I woud also be sold on the idea that it was totally legit and above board.</p>
<p>As it stands, should I ever be in the bizarre situation that I was looking for the type of work he offers, I would go elsewhere&#8230;.</p>

				<p>Wow! Talk about reinventing yourself! This site indeed looks amazing. I particularly like how they did the menu bar and color scheme. The first blog article was also nice from a lay perspective. They also redid their services page to make it sound more professional and specific.</p>
<p>I still have a picture of their Google search results, though. It starts with their site, with tons of praise. Next link is: &#8220;In the Doghouse&#8230;&#8221; Then a bunch of sites linking to Bruce&#8217;s post. Talk about death by advertising [via Google]. Hilarious. I wonder if I should post it.</p>

				<p>Uhm, that new site is pretty bad too. The grey on dark is horrible for reading, it&#8217;s way too dark overall and the little highlight when mousing over sections is tacky and breaks down when you mouse of &#8220;socialize&#8221;.</p>
