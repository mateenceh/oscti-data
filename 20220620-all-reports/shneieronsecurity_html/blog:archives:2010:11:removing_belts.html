		<p>The TSA is making us remove our belts even when <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/ask_the_pilot/2010/11/04/belt_removal_at_security_checkpoint/index.html">we don&#8217;t have to</a>.</p>
<p>European airports have made us remove our belts for years.  My normal tactic is to pull my shirt tails out of my pants and over my belt.  Then I flash my waist and tell them I&#8217;m not wearing a belt.  It doesn&#8217;t set off the metal detector, so they don&#8217;t notice.</p>

				<p>Both my belts and shoes set off the detector &#8211; so my response has been to not wear a belt and where flip-flops when travelling.  Takes 3 minutes to get through security no matter what airport.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also taken to only bringing my iPad with me instead of a full laptop now that TSA is consistently (key word here) not forcing me to take it out of my backpack.</p>
<p>All completely silly.</p>

				<p>Well before the TSA, whenever your belt buckle activated the metal detector the screeners would have you twist and hold your buckle horizontal and walk through again, easily bypassed detection.  Times have changed.</p>

				<p>The first time I had to take my belt off I was leaving Ben-Gurion. The 19 year old with the machine gun got nervous when I started pulling down my pants too.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; I asked the wildly gesticulating young man with the assault rifle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just belt.&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>It was that day I discovered my super-power.</p>

				<p>Guy in the linked letter got what he deserved. You manipulate minions; you don&#8217;t be honest with them and you don&#8217;t obstruct them. That&#8217;s a simple rule of life. The system won&#8217;t change while idiots are directing their hostility at the wrong front.</p>

				<p>@ Bruce,</p>
<p>As you may know by know we have an expression in the UK which is &#8220;belt up&#8221; (means to keep quiet)</p>
<p>maybe you should have &#8220;belted up&#8221; before you made your above confession 😉</p>
<p>Time will tell if you get pulled asside and get SSSS tattooed across your forehead&#8230;</p>

				<p>@keith:  Who are the idiots in this picture?</p>
<p>Is it angry passengers directing their hostility at TSA minions (rather than the governmental overlords who make such idiotic policies)?</p>
<p>Or is it those governmental overlords, who are directing their hostility against the shoes and belts of the travelling public, instead of doing things that would actually improve airport security (like better access controls for luggage handlers and other airport employees)?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m partly being facetious here, but I&#8217;m also pointing out in all seriousness the ambiguity of your post.  I honestly can&#8217;t imagine any possible terrorist attack (or even any dozen terrorist attacks) which is worse for the U.S. than all of the damage you are doing to yourselves since the 9/11 incident.  Your tourism industry alone must lose billions of dollars every year because of all the international travellers who aren&#8217;t willing to put up with all of this shit just to visit the U.S.  But even if you don&#8217;t care about the economic harm, or the harm to your global reputation, you should at least be worried at being systematically stripped not just of your civil liberties, but also of your dignity.</p>

				<p>Odd, my experiences are that American airports makes me remove belt as well as shoes, while some man or woman in rubber gloves slides fingers halfway down my crotch. Truly not very pleasant.</p>

				<p>I notice that Bruce has an EFF banner in the side there.  Is there some non-profit org that lobbies (with nonzero success) against security theater?  It&#8217;s still farting into the wind, but I feel like I should do SOMETHING.</p>

				<p>My solution to the absurd levels of invasiveness now practiced by the TSA is to cease visiting, or transit through, the USA.</p>
<p>TSA = bad for tourism. Great for Skype.</p>

				<p>I go with the spirit of some of the comments above.</p>
<p>I think it is a shame that the US public has allowed itself to be so cowed by the vague threat of terrorism that they can deter income generating tourists and impede their citizens going about their lawful business.</p>
<p>(rant over back closer to the topic)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried the pretend no belt stunt before and never even come close to getting away with it. I am jealous.</p>

				<p>Maybe there&#8217;s a niche market for a high-security naturist airline. I&#8217;m sure the TSA would approve. Screening would be pretty easy.</p>

<p>Scan through that, people!</p>
<p>If that fails, the next logical step is nudism.</p>

				<p>Ah come on, don&#8217;t make such a big deal out of this. Just wear those cool belts with the removable belt buckles. When they ask you to take it off just remove the buckle! The actual belt won&#8217;t be setting off any alarms (unless it&#8217;s a really kinky one) 😛</p>

				<p>For all those who suggest we rise up against the TSA and fight for our freedom and dignity, I would like to know what do you suggest we do? Write letters to our Senator? E-mail the TSA? Unfortunately this is a &#8220;minor&#8221; issued to our elected officials and one they are not willing to fight (until it impacts them personally).  I am against what the TSA is doing and how they attempt to provide security, but I don&#8217;t see a way to drive attention to this issue.</p>

				<p>Introducing the new “Time of Terror” line of air traveler&#8217;s jumpsuits.  Comfortable and attractive, this disposable tyvek garment will be sold from dispensers next to the smartkart racks.  Think of the convenience &#8211; no belt to lose, no pockets to empty, no shoes to remove, and no undergarments in which to conceal flight disrupting charges of PETN.  Preprinted in the following patterns: jeans-n-tee, power suit, bereavement black, flight crew blue, and the ever popular gitmo.  As an added convenience your government issued photo ID and boarding pass will be laser printed on either sleeve at the airline check-in kiosk.  Remember, in a “Time of Terror” everything is simpler&#8230;</p>

<p>I think the best thing regular people can do is to rabble-rouse.  I like parody as a good way to get people thinking about the absurdities.  Stuff like TSA Gangstaz ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7AWw7t5zj0" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7AWw7t5zj0</a> ) gets the point across without being preachy.</p>

				<p>What the TSA doesn&#8217;t seem to realize is that their continually escalating hassles only increase the power and effectiveness of terrorists. Even if a terrorist plotter fails to blow up an aircraft, he succeeds in provoking a boneheaded arse-covering reaction from the TSA that will henceforth burden every traveler.</p>
<p>Loss of liberty, privacy, and now bodily integrity may not be as spectacularly pleasing to Allah as burnt infidel bodies falling from the sky. But it does inflict slow enduring damage to the enemy that&#8217;s surely worth a virgin or two in Paradise. With the TSA always ready to help, even failure becomes a success for terrorists.</p>
<p>I know that&#8217;s not how we&#8217;re supposed to view the TSA and its heroic officers fighting at the very front lines of the Global War on Terror. But it&#8217;s a message the TSA continually sends terrorists, apparently obvious to everyone but the leaders at TSA Headquarters.</p>

				<p>keith: You manipulate minions; you don&#8217;t be honest with them and you don&#8217;t obstruct them. That&#8217;s a simple rule of life. The system won&#8217;t change while idiots are directing their hostility at the wrong front.</p>
<p>And it won&#8217;t change by directing your anger at the right front either &#8212; so you might as well vent your hostility rather than just slowly die inside.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a simple rule of life. And in fact, it&#8217;s the little revolts that end up changing things. It&#8217;s the refusal to get to the back of the bus that&#8217;s the spark &#8212; not the great committee meetings of powerful politicians, the letters to the editors or electing the Other Brand to the White House.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a simple rule of life. 99% of law is simply ordering people to do what they&#8217;d do anyway.</p>

				<p>Okay, so no belts because the full-body scanner doesn&#8217;t like them.</p>

				<p>I fully agree with George&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>If I ever fly again, I will use a new strategy for airport &#8220;security.&#8221; I will refuse to go through the body scanner. I will put my shoes, pants, and shirt or jacket into the bins for the metal detector. I now will be wearing only a skin-tight wrestling singlet, and no frisking or pat-downs will be needed to show that I am bomb-free.</p>
<p>The singlet I really want to wear unfortunately is not available in my size. It is an old USSR wrestling uniform with &#8220;CCCP&#8221;, the hammer and sickle, and a tank photo on the front, the Kremlin on the back, and, hilariously, ghosted images of Stalin and Lenin over the buttocks! It seems totally appropriate for tweaking the totalitarian TSA.</p>
<p>You can see the singlet here: <a href="http://www.usawrestlingproducts.com/modules/cart/products.php/nav_id/210/page/1/id/993/name/CCCPSublimatedSinglet" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.usawrestlingproducts.com/modules/cart/products.php/nav_id/210/page/1/id/993/name/CCCPSublimatedSinglet</a></p>

				<p>@Eric Thomas Black:  &#8220;Not to mention the idiocy of screening pilots. It isn&#8217;t like they need weapons to &#8220;hijack&#8221; the plane. &#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, screening pilots is probably a very good idea.  If you don&#8217;t, then you open up lots of possible attacks:  terrorists disguised as pilots, terrorists threatening pilots to force them to smuggle contraband through, and pilots that willingly smuggle contraband to an accomplice without revealing or risking themselves, to name a few.</p>
<p>If I were a pilot, I&#8217;d probably be GLAD that I went through the same screening as everyone else&#8211;if I have a privilege that the bad guys would like to exploit, that makes me a target.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s still the issue that &#8220;the same screening as everyone else&#8221; is set to the wrong level&#8230;</p>

				<p>I recently had an experience at BWI. It was my first encounter with the full body scanner. I had put all my luggage and laptop through X-ray and then was told I had to go through the full body scanner. However I still had my wallet with me. They said no wallets through the scanner. I said I would not be separated from my wallet &#8211; what if someone stole my wallet while I was in the scanner and my wallet was going through the x-ray machine separately. So I refused to go through the scanner which caused all kinds of problems. In the end someone came over and watched my wallet go through the X-ray machine picked it up and handed it to me on the other side. Of course I then had to go through the full pat down experience but at least I still had my wallet. I think the answer is that everyone should refuse to go through the full body scanner and then see what kind of mess TSA gets in. The queues would be enormous. Noone would get through the security screening on time. They don&#8217;t have enough time and people to perform a full pat down on everyone. It would be a real mess.</p>

				<p>This is so &#8220;third world&#8221; it kills me.</p>
<p>We used to laugh and joke about bureaucrats who only existed to exercise authority to levels of ridiculousness and corruption. We thought it was funny because it seemed so awkward and insecure compared to real security &#8212; smooth-running, uninterrupted and relaxed travel.</p>
<p>Now who is laughing. I find this to be the key to the story:</p>
<p>&#8220;Belts, it has been determined, can interfere with the images procured by the new full-body scanners being deployed at checkpoints around the country. And so, from now on, passengers need to remove them.&#8221;</p>
<p>WTF? How completely and utterly stupid. Who authorized purchase of a scanner that can not handle a belt?</p>
<p>Next will they say the scanner can not handle oxygen so we will have to swim in (even more expensive) vats of oil?</p>
<p>The belt rule was added after the scanners because these scanners are flawed. They failed.</p>
<p>What do you do with expensive flawed scanners? Apparently you keep them and try to convince the subjects to adapt at whatever cost.</p>
<p>I just want to know which silly third-world bureaucrat approved these things and how big is their new yacht?</p>

				<p>As the searches become more intrusive (any chance they&#8217;ll grow less?), remember a story John Lydon (better known as Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols) told about an accidental circumvention of security:</p>
<p>On arrival to the USA, officials decided to strip-search the band &#8212; as it happened, they first searched John Ritchie (Sid Vicious), who had not changed his underwear for quite a long time (according to Lydon, they were &#8216;orrible).</p>
<p>After that, the officials elected not to strip search the other band members.</p>

				<p>I fully realize that the TSA is bone-headed BUT I think the biggest problem is that they are almost never female, 25 and beautiful. You guys need to travel through Asia more often. I can tell you,  from personal experience, that there is one checker in Incheon, who after a pat down, will leave you with more than just your contempt to hide&#8230;.</p>

				<p>I am sure that if enough people start taking the train to Canada to fly international, the US will do something about it somehow.</p>
<p>If so many people are switching from airplanes to other forms of transport (driving, long-distance busses, trains etc) and the airline proffit margins are down, why arent the airlines complaining about this? (do the airlines still have the kind of lobbying power and influence in Washington that they used to have?)</p>
<p>If I was the CEO of a company and new rules brought in by the government were causing people to switch to my competitors, I for one would want to use all the lobbying power I had to do something about it.</p>
<p>Although on the other hand, I guess if the airlines complain (either about the security driving passengers away or any extra costs that the airlines face due to said security) they will be painted by politicans as &#8220;greedy&#8221; for putting proffits over &#8220;security&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am against what the TSA is doing and how they attempt to provide security, but I don&#8217;t see a way to drive attention to this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>And by this, the oppressors win.</p>
<p>As long as people feel powerless to stop the state bringing in more and more crazy rules then Democracy is a farce and we live in a totalitarian state. Even a change of ruling party has no real impact in the way the machinery of government rules our lives.</p>
<p>All Rosa Parks did was refuse to stand up. A simple, small, act that led to a significant (and painful) national change.</p>
<p>Part of the current problem is that this is not a single, polarised, issue. If you refused to take your belt off, it wouldnt lead to riots across the country, it would just lead to an arrest and some rubber glove action.</p>
<p>Maybe its already too late.</p>

<p>Well Austria and German airports do ask you to take your belt off for the metal detectors. However if you don&#8217;t have a metal buckle you don&#8217;t need to.</p>
<p>Also the attitude is very different. Basically they don&#8217;t really care all that much about any of the rules. They don&#8217;t check to see if the liquids you have are the right size as long as they are not 2l bottles etc.</p>
<p>One time i forgot my pocket knife (A long bladed one). They didn&#8217;t really care and just asked if I was coming back through the airport same day to pick it up, or if they could post to my home address.</p>
<p>Porn Scanners and humiliating pat downs are not here yet.  But i lack faith that we learnt anything the last few times around.</p>
<p>&#8220;lest we forget&#8221; &#8211;forget what?</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve just booked a flight from London to NZ, (paying extra to book by phone due to website crapness) and discovered when chatting with the agent that the flights via Hong Kong are more sought after due to the lack of the  US screening process that the airline can get away with charging an additional £200 for the flight.</p>
<p>Although checking the website now shows, this is only true when booking weeks in advance. Hmm&#8230;</p>

<p>how hard would it be to make a pair of flip-flops (we kiwis call them jandals &#8211; dunno &#8211; it must have been a product name&#8230; mind you, the Aussies call then thongs, which causes all kinds of problems for the USAnians!) out of solid C4?  If the explosive-sniffer dude didn&#8217;t pick you out, you&#8217;re in free!</p>
<p>Oh, and how hard would it be to make a cut-out in the shape of an automatic pistol from a thin sheet of lead foil and stick it to the bottom of one of the x-ray scanner trays? Not one you use, of course&#8230;  Fun for hours!!</p>

				<p>Fortunately the airlines seem to be waking up to the fact that over zealous security delivered by under IQed people is driving people away from air travel.</p>
<p>Whilst there&#8217;s zero cost to the TSA being moronic and seeing every traveller as the enemy the airlines are paying for it in reduced revenues.</p>
<p>I know people who used to fly every week but now only fly when they have to &#8211; less than once a month.</p>

				<p>For several years I had to wear an elbow brace (non-metallic), and the TSA always treated it like it was a weapons cache.  Being seen with it at a checkpoint was guaranteed to result in a patdown and a lot of questions.  Heck, once they gave me extra screening when one of the agents saw me take it off as I came up to the screening area.</p>
<p>My solution was simple:  remember to wear long-sleeve shirts.  Out of sight, out of mind.</p>

				<p>I can see the good in this. For years, every time I needed a new belt (I&#8217;m starting to question the savings in buying cheap belts), I&#8217;ve put a lot of time and thought into finding the best compromise between buckle strength and setting off detectors. No longer. Now I can go out and buy the biggest, sturdiest-looking belt buckle I can find. Hell, I can even wear my utilikilt monstrosity!</p>

				<p>@ Jonathan Wilson : &#8220;If I was the CEO of a company and new rules brought in by the government were causing people to switch to my competitors, I for one would want to use all the lobbying power I had to do something about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>What makes you think they aren&#8217;t? More to the point, why would you think they&#8217;d lobby for the kind of rollback you&#8217;d find acceptable?</p>
<p>Cynical me thinks it far more likely they&#8217;ll be lobbying for reduced taxes, or a subsidy, or some other federally-subsidized way of propping up their previous income without having to actually /carry/ any passengers. Really, it&#8217;d be win-win for them. They get the same income, but reduced fuel and expendables bills, and much lower wages bills.</p>
<p>At the limit, the government will be paying them to not fly at all &#8211; and who can blame then because that would be sooper-safe. There&#8217;s no way a terrorist can bring down a plane that isn&#8217;t flying.</p>
<p>I think Joesph Heller wrote something about this a few years ago in relation to alfalfa, but I&#8217;m pretty sure he meant it as a parody, not an instruction manual.</p>

				<p>There is no chance that there is malfeasance in other professions. Making insulting generalizations to dehumanize makes your statements bear greater veracity. You are better than these people because you complain on the internet anonymously rather than make a concerted effort to force your elected officials to deal with this issue. Everyone who comments on a blog must always have a perfect knowledge of all things, citing a specialization, title, or limited experience sometimes which means that they are an &#8220;expert&#8221; (like the title conferred upon the doctor who graduates last in class)<br />
 There is no possibility that this is an eight year old, bastard child of an ad hoc administration given absolute power to field 50,000 people in three months; power which has never been limited or diminished. There is no way that forcing the administration to comply with opm and title 5 rules would lead to an end of this perfect example of &#8220;control fraud&#8221; (via Federal Security Directors and their hand-picked deputies) claiming the divine right to ignore any and all laws, rules, and procedures (even their own secret directives) on a &#8220;discretion&#8221; derived from a directive that they have most likely never read. It is impossible to imagine that making an administration beholden to normal rules would allow for FOIA requests to be forced to be responded to easier, procedures to be uniformly assigned, evidence of misconduct to be audited, and considerations such as veterans preference, education, and positive factors to reassign the duties of the workforce, rather than the natural upward trajectory of nepotism and cronyism.<br />
Hell would freeze over if current policies were created in a lowest-common denominator manner to compensate for a demoralized workforce which punishes initiative and strict procedural adherence as a sign of questioning authority, forcing the better to leave only the chaff, the untrained, and those who believe strongly enough to stay and fight to try to stave of the cancerous nature of the arbitrary power wielded by the middle management to oppress the frontline, and the American Citizen as the ultimate casualty of this corruption.<br />
  &#8230;..Then again, these are all just false musings, as I&#8217;m one of those illiterate, knuckle-dragging, miscreant peons (as my lords like to remind us), that can&#8217;t understand what is going on, and any willingness to question their nonchalance about violating the oaths they took as federal employees would indicate a lack of trustworthiness and judgment on my part.</p>
<p>Bruce,  I told you once that they don&#8217;t exactly reward competence&#8230;..  I guess that statement may imply a certain vanity of an assumed expectation. The greater issue is just how beholden it all is to the whims of the local sovereigns (who have perfect control to shield impropriety at the expense of a few lowly Pharmakoi- their whistle blowers).</p>

				<p>The question you should all ask yourselves is where and when are you going to draw the line?  How much dignity and spine do you have left?</p>
<p>I see a lot of apathy and complaining, but little courage or show of standing for principles.</p>
<p>I guarantee you that money talks.  If you decide to stand up for your freedom by leaving the airport and making sure to tell the airlines why you&#8217;re not taking the flight, see how many people it takes before they reverse their processes.  If that doesn&#8217;t work, organise a protest.  Stop being a sheep unless you want to be a the wolf&#8217;s meal.</p>

				<p>There are several issues with the whole TSA process that confounds me. First many peoples religious beliefs are being stomped on, Muslin and Christian alike. The body is considered scared. In many religions looking on another&#8217;s body without being married is considered disrespectful. Second is that most country&#8217;s who have slipped down the slop of loosing their freedom and privacy use nudity as a way of humiliating the targets. So in the US we now are separated from our belongings then we are virtually stripped viewed by someone unknown to us. Reminds me of the Nazi&#8217;s. Third where does it stop. Will they develop portable machines that they can drive down and virtually see into your home? First we loose the privacy of our bodies then we start moving to loosing the privacy of our homes. These have been fundamental to foundations of privacy to have control of my body and my home. The only way to violate it was through due process. We all have become criminals. To bad unlike our founders we can&#8217;t go to a new world. We have to now stand up and make a new world where privacy is important.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m pretty well put off from visiting America because of the security &amp; the general attitude that whatever the authorities choose to do to you is fine. I&#8217;m on the side of Noam Chomsky: any authority needs to be questioned regularly. Is it necessary &#8211; if so, ok, if not, scrap it.</p>

				<p>On Veteran&#8217;s Day I used my VA card for I.D. My reward was getting toasted in their brand new XRAY machine. How do they choose who gets a scan, PROFILING? My idiot was on a headset taking instructions from someone watching from afar. I feel soo honored to have put my life on the line so some fatcat can stuff his pockets selling tthese machines while manipulating the public with scare tactics.<br />
Google search reveals these machines are very dangerous to some travellers according to an army of MD&#8217;s!<br />
The Germans know a 4th Reich when they see it- thanks for the youtube!<br />
**Strip down, or opt for the pat down-make them waste their machine and cause delays for them, with small actions.</p>

re: The question you should all ask yourselves is where and when are you going to draw the line?</p>
<p>I see this sentiment a lot, but I think one thing missed is the MOST people in the US don&#8217;t fly very often, if ever.  When they do fly, it is basically necessary and they put up with whatever they must to get it over with.</p>
<h2>If you&#8217;re on your employer&#8217;s dime, you don&#8217;t have the luxury of making a political statement by missing your flight.  Likewise in most of the other circumstances that require normal people to fly.  Missing the flight to make a point is not a reasonable alternative, if it was, they wouldn&#8217;t be flying at all.</h2>

				<p>Perhaps what we need are flash mobs gathering at TSA checkpoint. Recall that it&#8217;s trivial to print your own bogus boarding pass, no need to purchase a ticket.</p>
<p>The mob would to a person refuse scanning and pat-down and in general use peaceful, lawful means to inconvenience as many passengers as possible for as long as possible. If the mob were interspersed in the group of real travelers it would likely take TSA a while to figure out that a coordinated action was in progress. I would think that just a few dozen mob participants could paralyze a busy hub such as LGA or DCA.</p>

				<p>Saw my first kiddie-porn scanning machine in Canada this weekend.</p>
<p>Went through the metal detector and the explosive swabs, and was directed to the kiddie-porn scanner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not getting in that damn machine&#8221; was my firm but polite reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn machine?&#8221;, asks the polite Canadian screener.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn machine&#8221;, says I, as politely as one can say &#8220;Damn machine&#8221;.   A minute of confused silence ensues.  Screener offers his opinion that &#8220;it&#8217;s not that bad now, they turned the resolution down because it used to be more detailed&#8221;.</p>
<p>Score.  An admission that these things <em>can</em> see more than we&#8217;re being told.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t care&#8221;, says I. &#8220;I am not a criminal and will not be subjected to an invasive scan, regardless of what you say. I&#8217;ll take the enhanced pat-down, let&#8217;s get started&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess this guy <em>really</em> didn&#8217;t want to be on junk patrol &#8211; he actually asked his supervisor if he could show me the image &#8211; oh that would of been so sweet.  Of course, his sup looked at him like he just pooed his pants again and said, somewhat witheringly, NO he can&#8217;t see the image. Give him his patdown.</p>
<p>So, although I don&#8217;t like being patted down, for me it was the (slightly) lesser of two evils.   And I will say this much.  The staff at this Canadian airport actually had the maturity to realize that I was not &#8220;disrespektin their authoriti&#8221; and did not get all up in my face.  As pleasant an encouter as one could wish for under the circumstances.</p>

				<p>Trouble with fully body scanners: (Sorry it is in german)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Bericht-Koerperscanner-arbeiten-fehlerhaft-1137004.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Bericht-Koerperscanner-arbeiten-fehlerhaft-1137004.html</a></p>
<p>According to the article the scanners currently under test at the Hamburg Airport have a false positive rate of nearly 100%. Apparently the problem is caused by multiple layers of clothing. It may be easy to detect metal weapons but for explosive underwear much more sensitivity is needed.<br />
Officially it is declared as software problem which is being worked on.</p>

				<p>I presume that the belt restriction is due to the density of the material. So&#8230;what kind of other materials could the masses wear that also defeat this system. Just think, if everyone wore clothes that defeated the system, then the TSA would be forced to stop using it.</p>

				<p>I remember pat-down searches on a flight from Frankfurt to the US as early as 2005 &#8211; and this was mandatory for all US-bound passengers. Also, passengers and hand luggage were screened twice (one checkpoint with metal detectors at an extremely sensitive setting, reacting to a bit of tinfoil I had in my pocket; the second checkpoint with pat-down search and another metal detector).<br />
At that time, I wondered why flights from Germany to the US seemed to be such a big security risk, while the security check on the return flight was quite lax in comparison&#8230; Now the Americans seem to get the same level of annoyance that we had back then 🙂</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m just through with flying.  I&#8217;m going to be driving 4250 miles on my next trip because it is less hassle, and not only that, it is less expensive for two people and we can bring as much luggage as we want (well up to what will fit in the car) without having to pay extra fees.</p>
<p>The airlines and tourist industries have already been hurting, with these new stupid and ineffective rules a lot more people are going to be making the same decision as me to drive or just stay home and they&#8217;ll be losing lots of $$$.  Maybe then they&#8217;ll use their political pressure to get TSA the smackdown it so righteously deserves.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t just tourism that will suffer either, all this extra hassle makes taking another look at video conferencing and other alternatives to travel worthwhile for business.</p>

				<p>Canadian is at least partially correct; we allow our political class to take actions that indicate we&#8217;re scared.  However, we&#8217;re not, not really.</p>
<p>About the only security check I can think of that makes sense at an airport is whether or not I have a couple of spare magazines for my sidearm.  If not, loan me some.</p>

				<p>The American Traveler Dignity Act was introduced today by Ron Paul. It is a small step in the right direction, although I am not sure I agree with privatizing security under federal shield, if it goes the way SFO has gone.</p>
<p><a href="http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=1796&#038;Itemid=60" rel="nofollow ugc">http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=1796&#038;Itemid=60</a></p>
<p>&#8220;It establishes that airport security screeners are not immune from any US law regarding physical contact with another person, making images of another person, or causing physical harm through the use of radiation-emitting machinery on another person. It means they are subject to the same laws as the rest of us.</p>
<p>Imagine if the political elites in our country were forced to endure the same conditions at the airport as business travelers, families, senior citizens, and the rest of us. Perhaps this problem could be quickly resolved if every cabinet secretary, every member of Congress, and every department head in the Obama administration were forced to submit to the same degrading screening process as the people who pay their salaries.&#8221;</p>

				<p>I have three responses to airport &#8220;security&#8221;:</p>
<p>1) I will not go through the scanner. I have to believe the pat down is no more fun for the person doing it than it is for me. I will plan for the extra time, and I will require that they do it in plain sight of multiple witnesses in case I need to call the police.</p>
<p>2) I will not subject my minor children to either search. The <em>act</em> of taking a picture of a minor is illegal, even if that picture is discarded. Possession of a picture of a naked child is illegal no matter the duration. Similarly, touching a child&#8217;s genitals by an adult other than a medical professional doing an exam is illegal too. More parents need to deny the federal government the ability to sexual abuse our children and to have them be the subjects of child pornography.</p>
<p>3) As someone with a graduate degree in Economics, I am choosing not to fly to demonstrate that the extra cost of flying compared to other forms of travel is now no longer offset by the convenience or less amount of time it takes to get to my destination. If consumers make a rational decision that considers all facets of the choices, flying becomes an inferior good that can only compete by lowering prices or improving convenience to where it becomes attractive again. My hope is that airlines will realize that they cannot be profitable until flying is more convenient than alternate methods of travel.</p>
<p>This is one topic on which liberals and conservatives should agree, even if the reasons are different. The government is violating our civil liberties, it has expanded both its reach and size in order to do it, taxes have increased to pay for that expansion, and profits have decreased because government rules have deterred consumers from buying from private corporations. Sounds to me like Democrats, Republicans, Tea Partyers, and Libertarians finally have a subject they can all find something to dislike together.</p>

				<p>Interesting. I was about to look for a non-metallic belt to save having to remove mine, not so much for the hassle of removing it as for having to replace it afterwards. Then again, I opted for the pat-down rather than the scanner when I had to do it (for political reasons &#8211; I think if they are going to do this, no reason to make it easier for them) so it might be worth getting anyway.</p>
<p>FWIW, other than the imposition, the pat-down is not that traumatic and I heartily recommend opting for it if you want to make a point and can take a fairly minor personal contact (I&#8217;ve had worse getting into a nightclub)</p>
