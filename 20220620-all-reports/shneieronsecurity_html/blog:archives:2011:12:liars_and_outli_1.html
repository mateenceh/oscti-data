		<h2 class="entry"><i>Liars and Outliers</i> Galleys</h2>
		<p>My publisher is printing galley copies of <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/12/status_report_l_1.html"><i>Liars and Outliers</i></a>.  If anyone out there has a legitimate reason to get one, like writing book reviews for a newspaper, magazine, popular blog, etc., send me an e-mail and I&#8217;ll forward your request to Wiley&#8217;s PR department.  I think they&#8217;ll be ready in a week or so, although it might be after the new year.</p>
<p>Additionally, I&#8217;m going to get 10 to 20 copies that I&#8217;d like to give away to readers of this blog.  I&#8217;m not sure how to do it, though.  Offering copies to &#8220;the first N people who leave a comment&#8221; would discriminate based on time zone.  Giving copies away randomly to commenters seems, well, too easy.  The person in charge of PR at Wiley wants me to give copies away randomly to people who &#8220;like&#8221; me on Facebook or tweet about me to their friends, or do some other sort of fake distributed marketing thing, but I&#8217;m not going to do that.</p>
<p>So to start, I&#8217;ve decided to give away a free galley copy of <i>Liars and Outliers</i> to the person who can come up with the best way to give away free galley copies of <i>Liars and Outliers</i>.  Leave your suggestions in comments.</p>

				<p>Winner who comes up with the best way to give away free copies of the book gets a free copy of the book?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s easy: the best way to give away free copies of the book is to hold a contest where you give away free copies of the book.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ll mail you a box with another box inside of it with a prepaid mailing slip. All you have to do is put the book in and seal it. You could do it for the first N boxes to arrive. Possible downsides include receiving a ton of empty boxes.</p>

				<p>Some sort of quickie movie plot threat contest? Say, you give the first, stupidest threat you can think of and give galley copies to those who can make it sound as scary as possible? Or, you give a foiled stupid attack, and the copies go to those who detail the most egregious yet realistic overreaction on the part of the security apparatus?</p>

				<p>What about giving away copies to 10-20 (whatever you decide) people who comment on this entry.  But instead of the time-based priority order that you don&#8217;t like (for good reason), have priority order be determined by the number of blog entries of yours they&#8217;ve commented on in the past, say, two years?</p>
<p>So they would need to express interest on this blog entry but also have been a regular reader and commenter in the past.</p>

				<p>How about winners are the ones who give the most compelling reason they should get the book?</p>
<p>Or:<br />
Winners are the ones who can socially engineer your publisher into sending them a book.</p>

				<p>Since as you say in the book the society is based on trust, you should trust any commenter who honestly says that they are the best person to receive the book.</p>
<p>And in my completely and unbiased honest judgment, that person would be me.</p>

				<p>Perhaps give copies to a mix of people who have <em>already</em> reviewed your books / blogged / linked to your blog / tweeted about you / in some other readily-identifiable way shown that they&#8217;re interested in what you talk about.</p>
<p>Reserve a couple of copies for people who have sent you interesting squid stories.</p>

				<p>The best way to give away Liars and Outliers is&#8230;. to ask for 2011&#8217;s biggest Liar and biggest Outlier.<br />
My biggest Liar for 2011 is Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br />
My biggest Outlier for 2011 is Virtual Payment systems (google wallet etc).</p>

				<p>Have a security story contest.<br />
People will send in stories how security made a difference in their lives.<br />
Have categories like:<br />
&#8211; Sad/Absurd/Surreal.<br />
&#8211; Funny.<br />
&#8211; Fiction.<br />
&#8211; In-depth analysis.<br />
&#8211; Incredibly clever tricks.<br />
&#8211; Bypassing security (must be a new story!)</p>

				<p>Make a XOR of each letter (ASCII) of user name. Give books to those that yield highest number (byte). E.g. for &#8220;Josip Medved&#8221; total score would be 0x54 (based on 0x 4A 6F 73 69 70 20 4D 65 64 76 65 64).</p>

				<p>My suggestion is to give them to the first N people who post their name, address, DOB, and SSN (or similar number) on this blog so that the book gets into the hands of those who really could use it.</p>
<p>But on a more serious note I think that giving away books to readers of this blog is a poor idea. Lots of people including myself chose to post anonymously and honestly I&#8217;m not willing to give up my anonymity just to get a free book.</p>

				<p>Given the content of your book, you could try:</p>
<p>&#8220;Give an example of the time you were an outlier in a social circmstance. An anecdote, or incident when you gained an advantage based on playing with preconceived socital norms. The ones that I like the most, get a book.&#8221;</p>
<p>To boot, you also get a few very interesting anecdotes, dealing with social engineering, etc. Something that would also be of great interest to your audience.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t think you can do much better than giving them at random. Either your choice method depends on the people, or it doesn&#8217;t (in which case it&#8217;s &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; at most). So let&#8217;s suppose it depends. It could still be random: for a given way of testing people, you get a score, affecting the probability that each get the book. There are deterministic scoring systems (probability 1 to the best scores, 0 to the rest) and uniform ones (1/N for each, no test), and the gray area in between.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see what non-uniform scoring system would be &#8220;fair&#8221;. You could test users about the number of comments on this blog; but do you want to reward the person that are comfortable with expressing their opinion, instead of, say, long-time readers that don&#8217;t post comments? You test security knowledge, but isn&#8217;t your book also (mostly?) directed to non-security-specialists?</p>
<p>So all the proposed scoring systems so far seem unfair. That&#8217;s not a proof, but fairness is a characteristic of uniform randomness, in some sense. The fairest way to choose is not to choose.</p>
<p>Of course, you may wish to optimize something else than fairness.</p>

				<p>How about get people to send you postcards from where they live.  Pick 20 random ones from that.  They are people who care enough about your work to make the effort to physically send something.</p>
<p>Yes, that means the anonymous posters can&#8217;t play but it&#8217;s just a suggestion after all.</p>

				<p>No, wait, it came back to me.</p>
<p>Soem kind of &#8220;Know your subject&#8221; test. Ask people to quote you on a subject. Give 24 hours for, say, a good quote from Schneier on &#8220;toys&#8221; or &#8220;cake&#8221; or something else mundane.</p>
<p>People who know you and your work, should be able to dredge something up in that time. And you don&#8217;t exclude lurkers like me that never post here.</p>
<p>Of course, judging would be necessarily subjective. But I think it could be fun. You seem to enjoy being misquoted in other contexts&#8230;</p>

				<p>How about giving them to libraries in and outside of the US. You would probably want more than 20 copies for this though 😉</p>

				<p>The first N to socially engineer a copy from your publisher, getting Wiley to send to someone in a government who they have fooled Wiley into thinking are a journalist or school board?</p>
<p>(People might engineer you into thinking they get credit for sending to someone obvious, but that&#8217;s fair game.)</p>
<p>I said N, because I want you to leave a few of copies ring-fenced for the first M to send you a solution to a message you post in Solitaire cipher!</p>
<p>Many of your fans and followers are into actual technical details of cryptography, and a signed copy of the book from you congratulating them on bruting or breaking the cipher will be worth more than anything in the world.</p>
<p>And if you like this, I don&#8217;t want to get a copy of the book for this, I want to <em>win</em> a copy of the book 🙂</p>
<p>Oh, as an afterthought, ring-fence two of the Solitaire books for the first school or collage students who succeed.  That&#8217;s the publicity win, and its a really great way to get younger nerds on-board.</p>

<p>I just hope you haven&#8217;t quoted that song somewhere in the book. Couldn&#8217;t grep it since I don&#8217;t have it (yet). There are also songs for &#8220;Outlier&#8221; but they&#8217;re not by bands as prominent as Queen (were).</p>

				<p>I propose that you give away your book in the form of a &#8220;chain letter&#8221; sent to hacker spaces.  You can start on the West Coast with these:</p>
<p>23b Shop<br />
418 E. Commonwealth, Unit #1<br />
Fullerton, CA 92832</p>
<p>Nullspace Labs<br />
1015 S Main St<br />
Los Angeles, CA, 90015</p>
<p>We will then read it and pass it on by mail or at our next gathering.</p>

				<p>You can always spend time to design 19 security challenges, either of similar complexity, or graded, so people can earn their free book by solving it. Actually this can be used by the PR of Wiley to generate more hype about the book, but this would require setting up significantly hard challenge that would be able to survive at least an week under the pressure of the highly knowledgeable crowd around here</p>

				<p>Announce that at the last minute the NSA and TSA have insisted that certain major redactions are required in several chapters of your book, making the whole enterprise now of rather tenuous value to you and the target audience, your community. You appeal to the crowd, making a plea for all interested parties, especially those in influential government positions, to write letters to the agency heads and the Assistant Attorney General head of DOJ&#8217;s National Security Division, calling for the attack dogs to be kept at bay on this particular book. You ask to be copied on all such correspondences. You then pick from the &#8220;best&#8221; letters, for your free book give-aways: 6 for most apparently compelling arguments, 6 for spookiest approach, 6 for least useful attempts to help, and 2 drawn at random.</p>

				<p>I have two suggestions:</p>
<p>1) you have blogged previously asking for help/suggestions on various aspects of the book.  Give the books to those people that have provided the most thought-provoking / surprising / helpful comments</p>
<p>2) don&#8217;t give them away; auction them and use the proceeds for a charity of your choice</p>

				<p>Isn&#8217;t it a bad idea to let the untrusted parties (us) to pick the challenge they want to do? Seems like a fail unsafe scenario to me, relies first party&#8217;s ability to spot the rigged or trivial challenges.<br />
As for the &#8220;best way to give away free galley copies&#8221; I say give them out to those who ask for one, that being said could I have one? 😛</p>
<p>You didn&#8217;t define &#8220;best&#8221; and if you ask the people who get one using that method, I bet you they will agree it&#8217;s the best too! 🙂</p>

				<p>Suggestion for the book giveaway:</p>
<p>Collect emailed entries up to Christmas Day. Hash each entrant&#8217;s email address using Skein HMAC (and a secret password). On New Years Day, reveal your secret password, and the 10-20 lowest-value hashes (i.e. the first 10-20 in a numerical sort).</p>

				<p>Don&#8217;t just give them away&#8230; make people trick, cheat and socially engineer them away from you. If nobody succeeds, you can honor the best attempts with a copy.</p>
<p>Alternatively, giving them to university libraries outside the US would be nice. This would also increase your &#8220;fan base&#8221;.</p>

				<p>Post an encrypted message that gives instructions for how to apply for one of the copies. As I have only just completed the Royal Holloway cryptography module I am probably ruling myself out by making this suggestion.</p>
<p>An alternative would be to go with Louie&#8217;s earlier suggestion, supply the first copy to Louie and then the second copy to me, thereby reducing your problem to the &#8217;18-book giveaway conundrum&#8217; instead of the 20-book version! Good luck with it.</p>

				<p>That&#8217;s fairly easy.</p>
<p>As many already suggested, the easiest way is to have a contest. The kind of contest, depends on how much time you want to lose &#8220;grading&#8221; the answers (from a simple &#8220;find the hidden intell&#8221; to a &#8220;please write an essay describing the most ridiculous security theatre situation you can imagine&#8221;).<br />
As timezone is a factor, you&#8217;d have to make a coordinated announcement on the contest rules.</p>
<p>To spice things up, you could hide the contest&#8217;s URL inside a simple crypto challenge, very much like Britain&#8217;s GCHQ latest recruitment ad (<a href="http://www.canyoucrackit.co.uk/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.canyoucrackit.co.uk/</a>).</p>

				<p>The subtitle of the book &#8220;How security holds society together&#8221; is (afaiu) a compact summary of the central theme of the book.</p>
<p>I suggest the copies away to people who submit single sentences that show examples of this principle.</p>
<p>One such example might be &#8220;Good fences make good neighbors&#8221;.</p>
<p>You could then pick the 19 (20 if you include the one above) sentences and use them for making some more marketing material, driving the message of your book.</p>
<p>A variation of this idea might be using reader submitted pictures (but this would discriminate against the graphically challenged).</p>

				<p>Here&#8217;s an idea for a contest worthy of the Liars and Outliers concept:</p>
<p>To enter, you make a video of yourself telling the most outrageous truthful story you can think of (or make one up if you wish to bluff).  Videos are uploaded to YouTube and tagged as part of the Liars and Outliers contest.</p>
<p>People are then instructed to vote on the video they think is the &#8220;most outrageous truthful story&#8221;.  In other words, if your story is so outrageous that it seems like a lie, people won&#8217;t vote for it.  So the challenge is to strike the right balance between being preposterous and entertaining, but believable, in order to get votes.  The ability to tell the story with a straight face will of course be a factor in how people perceive the video.</p>
<p>The videos with the most votes after some period of time win.</p>

				<p>My2c:</p>
<p>It completely depends on your priorities. Thus if you want to spread them geographically, collect entries and maximize the sum of distances. If you want to preach to the converted, make some kind of contest who knows the most on /says the friendliest things about you/&#8230;<br />
I deem the latter approach especially useless if your objectve is to provide knowledge.</p>
<p>If you are striving for fairness, which is implied by you considering timezones, you should collect entries for a time a multiple of the circulation time of the sun (probably spanning some days to allow for different holidays to pass) and draw the 20 lucky winners uniform at random from that list. Beforehand you should spend some effort to  root out double entries, which is a hard or probably impossible considering sock puppets.</p>

				<p>Spray the pages lightly in nitromethane (model aircraft fuel), then leave copies lying around in airports.  This seems to meet all the requirements of getting publicity for the book, teaching airport security people about security and risk management, and adding a little excitement to the life of anyone who tries to take it through security.</p>

				<p>Give copies to the people who write the best impression of a Bruce Schneier blog post.</p>
<p>This achieves the publisher&#8217;s goal (free distributed &#8220;social media marketing&#8221;), but in a more thoughtful and engaging way: their readers learn something about security, and there&#8217;s a Scheier-brand &#8220;I already wrote about this&#8221; link to one of your blog posts where they can learn more about you.  In addition to being a more meaningful version of &#8220;Like us on Facebook!&#8221; it&#8217;s also got a much better sense of humor.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve linked to one of these before, but I&#8217;m having trouble finding the link.</p>

				<p>Maybe a little mathy:</p>
<p>I think you should collect the names of your posters (either this item, for all posts this year, or across all posts), rank the first letter of their names (some only leave one name, so use only the first name) then distribute one book at random to someone with a name that starts with the most popular letter, a second to the next highest ranked, and so on, until the free book supply is exhausted.</p>

				<p>I like Mv’s idea, but it could be seen as open to accusations of favouritism. How about writing 10-20 security related question (stuff that’s covered in the book, or maybe stuff you covered in this blog) and set your blogging engine to post them at set times (to mitigate the time zone issue) over a few weeks (in the run up to the launch). First correct answer wins a book.</p>

				<p>A couple of my ideas have already been posted (so I won&#8217;t repeat them again).<br />
But, to please your publisher the people you give to (or the method of choosing or giving) needs to be able to generate chatter about the book, preferable in circles out side of this blog / forum / community.<br />
you may have to give 2 copies to some &#8211; one to generate the interest and one as the prize (to keep) depending on the method of interest gneration.</p>
<p>If the idea to generate interest also highlights a security issue the Bonus points (I.e. drop-lifting the book causing a knee jerk security reaction).</p>
<p>Goes without saying that Clive of course gets a copy.</p>
<p>1 copy to the least procteced Facebook peep that shares the competion rules from their profile.</p>
<p>1 copy to the twitter post that manages to get the largest retweet.</p>
<p>(and to even out the numbers again) 1 to the linkdin / other social site user that promotes the competion hence book and Bruce widest (socially speaking  &#8211; the geography is becoming a moot point in the web social world)</p>

				<p>Perhaps you ever wanted a collection with nice postcards from all over the world. Then you can award copies to the guys who sent you the nicest cards.</p>
<p>On the other hand, how about a puzzle. And the winner gets a free copy. I like puzzles. It should be about some security-stuff</p>

				<p>Could I suggest the LibraryThing Early Reviewers program for a few copies? They algorithmically match recipients based on interest (indicated by their selecting the book during a monthly round of reviews) and similarity of existing library, so you&#8217;re likely to get some reviews that are both useful and knowledgeable about the subject.</p>

				<p>Dear Bruce,</p>
<p>Of course I am fond of my privacy, but I still would like to get a copy of your new book.</p>
<p>So, what I did is, I wrote a Perl script that generated two large prime numbers p and q, multiplied those to find n, calculated phi, e and d.</p>
<p>I translated my name and address into ASCII codes, converted those numbers into binary numbers, build blocks of 128 bits which I converted back to decimal numbers.</p>
<p>Then I did the magic step c ≡ p^e (mod n) on those numbers and I got lots of large numbers.</p>
<p>If you can decrypt those (I actually can send you a copy, but it would spoil the comment if I pasted them here), you can send me a copy of your book&#8230;;-)</p>
<p>I would have liked to do something with 2,3 or blowfish,  for this exercise, but I already spent hours on this simple RSA implementation&#8230;;-)</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>André</p>

				<p>How about giving them to the people with the most embarrassing TSA story?  I was traveling on the road with my family over Thanksgiving. Since we were driving 20 hours with my children I packed my pistol in my luggage.  It has a safety lock on it and is inside a cover. Once we get to the destination, my wife Molly, being the safety conscious person she is hides my clip in an inside pocket of my backpack so as to separate the ammo from the gun. She does not tell me this. Upon arrival back home I put away the pistol. A few days later I&#8217;m on my way out to Miami when the security check is just taking longer and longer. Five security personnel end up huddled around the monitor. And I&#8217;m rolling my eyes at the whole thing and joking with the person behind me that I must have left a bottle of water in there.</p>
<p>Three of the guys escort me over to a holding area and start giving me twenty questions.  They take the bag over to a table and wipe it all down. And I still don&#8217;t have a CLUE why they are so upset. Some person finally opens up the backpack and pulls out a full 45 caliber clip with hollow points loaded in it. I groan as I clearly now recognize it as mine but STILL don&#8217;t know for sure why it is in there. After about an hour of additional questioning I&#8217;m allowed to go. But I&#8217;m relatively sure I&#8217;m on some TSA &#8216;special attention&#8217; list. So maybe since I&#8217;m on that list I could also be on the list to get a copy of the book. I can mail you my backpack and you can hide it in there.</p>

				<p>This is <em>hard</em>. I first thought maybe analyse your web server logs to extract a set of the most frequent readers &#8211; something like cat access* | cut -d&#8217; &#8216; -f1 | sort |uniq| wc -l, but then you would find yourself giving it away to a robot.</p>
<p>The best I can come up with is to make a random selection from commenter&#8217;s names from the last month. The result might be to give it away to someone who doesn&#8217;t want it or might not benefit from it, but any method that can select a deserving recipient is likely to take far more effort than you really want to put in.</p>
<p>So just grab a few commenter&#8217;s names and pull one out of hat.</p>

				<p>Once again my ears have gone pink on reading the comments on one of Bruce&#8217;s blog pages and I thank those people for their kindly suggestions.</p>
<p>However, having read all the comments above (so far) a thought occurs,</p>
<p>A little while ago the school my son goes to set an Acrostic competition and the best got sent forward for consideration to a national competition to be published. And my son was lucky enough to be published, so now has set himself a target in life to be published again in some way 😉</p>
<p>So how about an acrostic competittion relating to either Bruce or Security but with a slight difference to make it more chalenging?</p>
<p>Now the normal rules for an acrostic is the first letter of each first word on each line of the poem should when read from top to bottom spell a word that relates in some way to the subject of the poem.</p>
<p>Now to make it more chalenging, how about a double acrostic where the first letter of the first word and the last letter of the last word on each line is used, BUT&#8230; instead of words, Bruce hashes the words on the front covers and back covers of the book. The hashes are then converted by some recognisable method to letters which are then used for the first and last letters on the lines, and each poem should be atleast ten lines long.</p>
<p>People then Email them to Bruce who posts them for people to vote for.</p>

<p>This solution tries to reward people for their helpful involvement in the greater work and also encourages insightful discussions on the blog in future.</p>

				<p>Following the theme of the &#8220;Chuck Norris jokes&#8221; (see <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=Chuck+Norris+jokes" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.google.com/#q=Chuck+Norris+jokes</a> ), I propose you award the books to the commenters who come up with the best &#8220;Bruce Schneier jokes&#8221;.  Examples:</p>
<p>Bruce Schneier once visited the TSA Headquarters, only to find the building completely deserted.  All the employees heard he was coming and called in sick.</p>
<p>Whenever Bruce Schneier travels, he carries two vials hidden in his beard.  The first vial contains lemon juice that turns yellow when there&#8217;s a security threat, and the second contains water that turns red when the threat is real.</p>
<p>Bruce Willis, Bruce Almighty and Bruce Schneier were traveling together on a plane when suddenly a man dressed in a robe lept to his feet, pulled out a grenade and shouted &#8220;Allahu Akbar!&#8221;  Bruce Willis said, &#8216;Stand back while I kill this terrorist.&#8221; Bruce Almighty said, &#8220;Wait, I will turn his heart to good.&#8221;  Bruce Schneier simply pushed the call button and when the flight attendant came, he asked for more popcorn.</p>

				<p>Ask people to nominate a colleague or friend to get the book. Then starting at the second (or nth) most popular nominee either take the next twenty or use a random interval.  One this gets people to think of others, chosing the second or nth negates automatically generated responses (you know if you are top you will not get a copy).  Chosing an interval is purely up to Bruce and how wide he wants to spread the net.</p>

				<p>My idea:</p>
<p>Post one particular interesting quote, dilemma, idea, etc used in your book that can spark some sort of debate.  Let people post their views, arguments for/against whatever it is&#8230;the most interesting or insightful responses get a copy of the book.</p>
<p>Not only will it offer a bit of a peek into the book, but it will generate more chatter and excitement about the book as well as getting a few copies out there.  People with the interesting responses who receive the book will probably also be some of the best people to talk it up and spread the word about it as well.</p>

				<p>You should follow the same paradigm as a security checkpoint.</p>
<p>The only strategy for selecting people to be checked or to receive a book that can&#8217;t be gamed, is to give the books away at random (and one to me 🙂</p>

				<p>If you&#8217;re going to give away copies to readers of this blog, I think there&#8217;s something to say for giving them out to those who consistently provide insightful, enlighting and humorous comments.</p>

				<p>I propose an interactive contest based on the main idea of the book, like you said &#8220;I will model the fundamental trade-off of societal security &#8212; individual self-interest vs. societal group interest &#8212; as a group prisoner&#8217;s dilemma problem&#8221;.</p>
<p>An example follows:<br />
People sign up for the contest<br />
They are randomly divided into groups of 20<br />
Each one of them has to answer the question:&#8221;Do you want a copy of the book right away?&#8221; with Yes or No<br />
If only one of the group answers Yes, he takes the book<br />
In other cases people with Yes are disqualified and people with No go to the next round<br />
And it goes like this until (somehow) you have 20&#8230;</p>
<p>I know it needs more work in order to get to exactly 20, but I hope you get the idea&#8230;</p>

				<p>I would auction them on eBay and give the proceeds to your favorite charity. It will allow the people who support you and are enthusiastic about your book to support you in a somewhat orderly fashion and it will allow you to &#8220;give back&#8221; to the community in a subtle way. It also requires some courage on your part in allowing the market to dictate the books value.</p>

				<p>First, thanks for your enduring efforts to talk about the true nature of topics, this makes you a valuable source of information.</p>
<p>And secondly, that you are multidisciplinary about you approach to the analyzing topics, including the human side of things.  &lt;/thoughtful butt kissing &gt;</p>
<p>And now a suggested approach:</p>
<p>Requirements:<br />
Solution should require some effort from contestants, and as stated in other posts, should not be game-able, and should not be uniquely solvable by the proposer, and lastly, does not require much of your time and will bring a general value to the world at large&#8230; with these requirements, I suggest the following:</p>
<p>Solution:<br />
Contestants pick a topic that is lacking attention in the media. Each contestant is to describe this topic and why it is important, and how to bring visibility (limit to 200 words).</p>
<p>Then let your blog readers vote on the importance of the topics posted, the clarity of description, and suggested the approach to bring visibility to this topic.</p>
<p>Benefits:<br />
1.  You get to see what people are thinking about, maybe something you have not as of yet.<br />
2.  Your readers to the heavy lifting of reading and voting.<br />
3.  You are inspiring contestants to think, and clearly communicate in a digestible format.<br />
4.  The winners are selected automatically based on actions, not luck, or chance, or time zone.<br />
5.  You will have a chance to see and blog about entrants if you desire.</p>
<p>And you should offer the sign the book, so it can be a keepsake for the next generations&#8230;.</p>
<p>Good luck&#8230;.mark</p>

				<p>For half of the books to give away, I think you should have Wiley assign you a &#8220;book fairy&#8221; to accompany you (for a while) around RSA. As you break into conversations, or are approached by people, or even if someone asks you a really good question during a talk, you can then have the &#8220;book fairy&#8221; reward them with a free book. The &#8220;book fairy&#8221; should be dressed in a security-appropriate fairy costume.</p>
<p>For the rest, I suggest variety of approaches, onsie-twosie:<br />
 &#8211; Appease Wiley, and give one away based on twitter RTs or Facebook Likes<br />
 &#8211; Have a poetry/haiku contest, as was suggested above, for one<br />
 &#8211; Cook up a survey that supports one of your research interests, randomly giving a book away to one respondent<br />
 &#8211; Provide one as a door prize for the academic workshops you&#8217;ve been supporting (economics or human behavior)<br />
 &#8211; etc.</p>

				<p>Put newsletter subscribers into a pool; select randomly and email to see if desire copy of book.  You could also give on to the oldest subscriber (as in when), the newest subscriber, then randomly.</p>
<p>I prefer anonymity, thus no ID for a blog post.  Rewarding blog activity merely rewards a fraction of your readers and while it acts as a reward, it does not &#8220;spread the word&#8221; to the unenlightened.</p>
<p>Of course, you could always send a copy to the top 20 world leaders 🙂  Not that they would read it, but hope springeth eternal.</p>

				<p>If you have 10 books, you could give one book away each day at noon (your time) to the most insightful or interesting commenter who posted a comment on schneier.com since the last book was given away. You could be the sole judge of comment quality and only allow one win per person.</p>
<p>This allows all time zones to compete over a period of 10 days and encourages people to contribute quality content (thus improving the website).</p>

				<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;give copies away randomly&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you mean random as in <i>random</i> or <i>pseudorandom</i>?</p>
<p>Interesting that many believe to receive a book you still have to work for it i.e. through puzzles or competitions (doing) or be a valued contributor or frequent reader (being)&#8230;</p>

				<p>How about this:</p>
<p>Give away n copies based on the best n stories describing how someone else deserves a copy. Examples might be best security teacher, best secuity researcher, or best security practitioner I know.</p>

				<p>Bruce, you&#8217;re a logical person but for this task, try to leave logic out of the equation. So why not choose the winner or winners for that matter, based on something completely illogical. Just pick up a few based on nothing, but because you just feel like it.</p>

				<p>No new ideas here.</p>
<p>Hashes sounds nice but should turn out to be random, and random is too obvious aka boring.</p>
<p>CIO&#8217;s is a very good idea, but how to define who get&#8217;s a copy?</p>
<p>An auction towards a charity is im my opinion the obvious choice, but how to combine it with the ideas  expressed in the book is the problem.</p>
<p>I therefore suggest that your readers should nominate CIO&#8217;s (gov allowed) who in their opinion is in need to read it. With this list you ask for donations to a charity of your choice connected with names on the list. Those on the list who created the highest amount in donations to that charity get a free book. Some people on the list might make high donations for someone else, so that they don&#8217;t get associated with the giveaway. It should create a nice big sum for charity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t want one; I&#8217;m just completely capable of buying one myself.</p>

				<p>Find the second receiver of a free copy (the first am i if you follow my suggestion 🙂 )  in a knockout competion ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament" rel="nofollow ugc">single-elimination tournament</a>) in which a single &#8220;match&#8221; is between two candidates. This two candidates have to come to an agreement about who is the &#8220;winner&#8221; that reaches the next round (or receives the free copy) in any manner they want. If they do not come to an agreement, draw lots.<br />
Alternatively appoint any other game to decide the single matches.<br />
Every candidate has to provide an (throw-away) email address in the comments to be informed about the match partner and to communicate with that partner. The winner of the tournament may suggest the next receiver of a free copy and the succeeding too, until all 19 copies are out.</p>

				<p>I would suggest going back over the last 2-3 years and randomly pick 20 people from that list. That way there is no one just entering to get a free book.</p>
<p>I would not use a metric like &#8216;the top 20 posters&#8217; because some people only post to relevant topics while others just like to espouse their opinions.</p>

				<p>The best way to give away the books it&#8217;s reading  all the comments of the last two or three months in your blog or remember the most importants, and send it as a christmas gift to the 10 or 20 who add  value in their comments or made some funny contribution. Nobody is going to be more glad to receive your book  than your readers.</p>

				<p>If it were me I&#8217;d take bribes.  In might seem similar to an auction, but brides are better!  You can still say it was free, you don&#8217;t have declare income for taxes and of course the best part (dramatic pause).  The person who wants the book has to figure out a way to bribe you over the internet.  I admit I have not done the research on this, maybe paypal already has a secure escrow for bribing.</p>

				<p>An idea from Good Will Hunting, go to a local college/university that has a security program or a security conference and post a security question or cryptography algorithm on a blackboard or notice board. Something only real security geeks would get. The person who gets it gets the book and a push in the right direction.</p>

				<p>Given:  1) Copies will already be provided to &#8220;the press&#8221; through other channels, and 2) The computer security world will already be all over this without any additional fanfare on your part, I suggest that you give the limited number (20 or so?) of these copies to the first 20 people who are NOT computer security types, but who rather request them based on the book&#8217;s broader psycho-social implications.  I think that&#8217;s the market that will require a little extra effort.  Or, you could give copies to the first people who can stump you with arcane security trivia.</p>

				<p>Why I&#8217;d like a free galley copy of Liars and Outliers, by Steven Orr</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like a copy because of a number of factors. I very much admire the work that Bruce has done, not only in the math side of developing crypto algorithms, but also in the side that targets The Great Unwashed. TGW are the people who desperately needed to have the concept explained in words, that confiscating fingernail clippers to get on a plane doesn&#8217;t actually make you safer. The definition of the average IQ is 100, so that means that about half the population is lower than that. It doesn&#8217;t mean they can&#8217;t learn; it just means they need a bit more help to master new concepts. It&#8217;s like Eskimos having 150 words for the different kinds of snow. If you don&#8217;t have the word for something then you don&#8217;t realize that you might even have the concept.</p>
<p>I feel elevated when I read Bruce&#8217;s books. I did work for the DoD for a while in the area of crypto, I use GPG, and I feel that I would get more out of reading the book than most people.</p>
<p>I could go buy the book, but I have to say that I&#8217;m watching my pennies very carefully these days. I&#8217;ve been working for a year, but before that I was out for two.</p>
<p>In addition, I was sued in Federal Court a few years ago for speaking out in public about practices in my community that caused highly increased concentrations of social services. Social services are an important part of every community, but in our case, we ended up as  the epicenter for servicing a 23 town region. Social service recipients are usually thought of as people who are down on their luck, hungry, unwed mothers, battered women, the mentally handicapped, etc&#8230; But it also includes murderers, rapists, arsonists, drug addicts and dealers. We were inundated with the latter category.</p>
<p>What was the point of the above story of the law suit? (Great question. I have a tendency to ramble.) At the time, they subpoenaed a huge pile of email from me (which I refused to turn over, BTW), but at that time I had not yet started to use GPG. In retrospect, I really wish that I had kept encrypted messages in my sent-mail folder so that they would have demanded that I decrypt them. Because I did not have such encrypted messages, I lost the ability to tell them that I did not have the ability to decrypt.</p>
<p>Lesson learned.</p>
<p>Anyway, I diverge. But! I&#8217;d really enjoy the read. 🙂</p>

				<p>There are many people who contribute to this blog with insightful comments, making it worth my while to read the comments in addition to the post itself. I cannot say that about many other blogs.<br />
Top commenter&#8217;s should be recognized, so I propose that half of the books be given to commenter&#8217;s who have contributed with many comments or people who consistently provided insightful comments. This is based on your subjective view of this blog.</p>
<p>The other half should just go to random people commenting on a post where you say that you are giving away books. (Give everyone a chance and drum up interest for your book.)</p>

				<p>10-20? how many people do you think will be reviewing the book? They should get the galleys first. Then what about people you want to review the book? Send one to Jon Stewart at the Daily Show for instance. At this point I would guess you would ideally have two or three left at most. Keep one for yourself, send one as a publicity stunt say to the eventual Republican nominee for president or a TSA director. Finally if you are in the enviable position of having one or two left&#8230; What about a charity? I&#8217;m sure some firefighters some where would love ta raffle such a thing off.</p>

				<p>Use a polling tool like ideascale.com to solicit two or three security related topics &#8211; for example:<br />
1. Where did you expend the most effort pertaining to security defenses in 2011;<br />
2. What are the top security-related threats that you will focus on in 2012;<br />
3. Share your top security-related story of 2011 (similar to longreads.com);</p>
<p>The tool would allow for the schneier.com community to vote up the top answers to the top of the stack. This would provide your visitors with a fantastic reading list that has been crowdsourced by your audience (and potentially influenced by you &#8211; if you choose).</p>

				<p>Well, do you have to &#8220;give&#8221; them away?  Why not sell them on Ebay with as a signed copy personally addressed to the winners!</p>
<p>Or maybe setup a virtual GeoCaching or similar type of treasure hunt?</p>
<p>Or maybe the best security-related cartoon?  (Newly made not just pulling from xkcd.)</p>
<p>Or recruit other blogs, etc. to use them as giveaways on their sites &#8211; thus saving you from coming up with ideas and making them do the work!</p>

				<p>Trying to relate to the theme of the book and how we relate to books themselves, here&#8217;s my entry:</p>
<p>Give the book away to the people who give the best examples of earning your trust with a quote from a book which is personally meaningful to them (thereby demonstrating some aspect of their character).  If you also relate to the quote, then perhaps you can trust that person.</p>
<p>As an example, my self-serving and rather circular entry for that competition would be:</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s problems require new thinking.  When we think about trust, our natural inclination is to think about personal relationships.&#8221; &#8211; taken slightly out of context from the blurbs on Amazon.com of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Liars-Outliers-Enabling-Society-Thrive/dp/1118143302" rel="nofollow ugc"> a forthcoming masterpiece</a> &#8211; so perhaps you should not trust me, since I rearranged the words!</p>

				<p>I feel bad for you, Bruce, having to read all these suggestions.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no &#8220;good&#8221; way of handing these out because, frankly, there&#8217;s no really &#8220;bad&#8221; way of handing them out either.  Whatever system you come up with can be gamed and if you try to make it impossible to game you&#8217;ll just end up working really hard for no noticeable benefit.</p>
<p>I say post an email address, randomly select 20 unique mailing addresses emailed to that address, send out the copies.  Your choice for whether multiple people from the same address can apply.</p>
<p>If you do actually want to do some work then in addition to a mailing address have each person also choose N whole numbers.  Give books to the lowest 20 unique numbers.  (N should be from 1 to 3 inclusive, depending on number of expected responses.)</p>

				<p>I assume you want to do this fairly quickly.  I would randomly pick from winners or runners-up in a few of your earlier contests such as best movie plot threats or TSA logos.  (No sadly I&#8217;m not in that group.)  It would add one more incentive for your future contests at least for those who assume your next book will be worth winning. 😉</p>

				<p>Bruce &#8211; right back at ya.  You choose.</p>
<p>I propose that the best way to distribute the copies is for you to choose.  It&#8217;s your book, and you can use whatever means you&#8217;d like.</p>
<p>Asking for your readership to choose a selection process is novel, but is somewhat like Time Magazine nominating &#8220;the protester&#8221; as person of the year.  While novel, it&#8217;s a cop out.</p>

				<p>What I generally do with my books is, keep a pile in the basement, occassions do pop-up to hand out a book one at a time</p>
<p>That gives me a happy moment, as well as a memory for the receipent, and the book surely gets read and passed around</p>

				<p>By solving simple cryptographic puzzles in which the answer to each puzzle provides part of the code which has to be entered into a form, or better yet emailed to you.  Answers to the puzzles will be accepted for one week, the entries received which are correct are then entered into random drawing.</p>

				<p>Post a security / encryption related puzzle.  Try to create a puzzle that relates to the content of your new book.  Have people email their answers to a mailbox by a given deadline.  Randomly select book recipients from the pool of correct answers.</p>
<p>This will be fun for participants and will also stand a pretty good chance of getting the books to a deserving audience.</p>

				<p>The obvious answer seems to be to post encrypted instructions on how to pick up the book, and give them to the first 20 people to figure out how to do it.  But if this is too obvious, how about asking for the best security limerick or joke?  Most of the posts so far have been way too serious.  And then you get to use the jokes later when you do your talk on the book.</p>

				<p>You could ask people to submit posts for your blog, and then give copies to the N people you publish.  That would both get rid of your books and get some interesting perspectives on the blog.  Although it would require alot of leg work on your part in reading the posts and picking the winners.</p>

				<p>To give away copies of the book, I would devise a contest with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_bid_auction" rel="nofollow ugc">Unique Auction Bid</a> where each entrant privately submits a positive integer (1, 2, 3, etc). The winners of the contest are the 10 individuals to submit the smallest numbers that were unique; in other words, find the contestants who submitted numbers not submitted by anyone else, and pick the 10 smallest numbers as winners.</p>

				<p>Instead of a contest or random allocation &#8211; very deliberately allocate your 20 copies to those charged with fixing high-profile security disasters (credit card data leaks, etc&#8230;).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re able to gift copies to those who have been called in to fix, say, a major retail credit-card information leak, Wiley PR may be able to extract some very valuable endorsements. Something like, &#8220;We&#8217;re here cleaning up this mess, if our predecessors had followed Bruce&#8217;s guidance this wouldn&#8217;t have happened&#8221; or  &#8220;Bruce is not just a pundit, but directly advises those working to clean up the biggest messes&#8230;&#8221;</p>

				<p>DiegoB, there&#8217;s something kind of funny about DOSing Bruce Schneier with empty boxes.</p>
<p>If Bruce picks that method, I&#8217;m totally going to forge the sender of my packet^H^H^Hages with people I know, in hopes that if some do get through, my odds of getting a book back increase a little.</p>
<p>I also like Fred P&#8217;s poetry contest idea.</p>
<p>My other idea is to pick the people with the most outrageous ideas for giving away free copies. Not silly ideas like &#8220;hand&#8221;-delivered by an elephant, but actual ideas that can work, without any kind of pachyderm, be it African or Asian. Unless you&#8217;re volunteering your own elephant for use in the giveaway.</p>

<p>My father was the pope and my mother worked in a traveling show until she was recruited by MI5 as a target decoy for the queen&#8217;s public appearances.  This worked out so well that she secretly became the queen after QEII stood too close to a Harrier Jump Jet during an RAF demonstration back in the 70&#8217;s.  But of course, I can&#8217;t talk about any of this.</p>

				<p>Wow! 250 comments in 10 hours.  You are going to sell a ton of books.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t recommend another contest.  The whole &#8220;What&#8217;s the best terrorist plot&#8221; thing you did a couple of April 1&#8217;s ago was pretty scary.  I still use it as the definitive cost of a completely effective and novel plot == one signed book (~$50).</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m not an anonymous coward, at least on this blog, using past postings would discriminate against them.</p>
<p>I think the only viable approach is the one you&#8217;re using here.  &#8220;Best response gets a book&#8221;.  You don&#8217;t even have to give away a book if the responses to some post aren&#8217;t that interesting.  Just post an entry once a week listing the best N responses from the previous week and send them a book.  If it leads to more thoughtful responses, that&#8217;s great for the blog.</p>

				<p>Greetings from Mexico!!</p>
<p>You can do an array of riddles that reveals hints, the answer of that hint will bring out the next riddle, and so on… until you consider is fair enough to win the book.<br />
The topic of the last riddle can be about how to submit the answers… so you can ensure you will get no spam on your inbox. 😉</p>

				<p>Assuming your goal in giving away these 10-20 books is viral marketing, you might want to focus on influencers.</p>
<p>You could, for example, look for people near you (e.g. friends of friends) in your social network of choice (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, G+), sort by people who have a lot of followers/readers and get retweeted/shared at high rates, make sure they are widely dispersed (not all friends of each other), then give them the books.</p>
<p>And, I hate to say this because it seems unfair, but you might want to limit to US only, primarily to minimize shipping costs and maximize sales impact.</p>

				</p>

				<p>There might be a way to appease your publisher and still touch into social media. Think about introducing a security related contest like many other people have suggested above, but instead it the medium in which to run it should be say tweets, limiting the # of characters (this also limits your contest a bit but you may a few interesting/humorous/creative results)</p>
<p>I do think your impact on a more social media aware audience is meaningful, it reaches a demographic (my own 18-35) more easily influenced than entrenched parties that are more resistant to change. It will help shape the discussion in the future and builds a base of individuals with a better understanding of security related topics, and specifically since it targets more general audience, which this books is looking to reach, you&#8217;ll get a wider amount of readers from different backgrounds hitting a contest in the social media realm. I think its certainly a better suggestion than just &#8220;liking&#8221; you.</p>

				<p>How about a simple riddle?  Not a huge crypto deal, but a simple riddle that takes more common sense to figure out than it does mathmatical &amp; analytical skill.  You could drop a few clues on your site in locations that are so obvious no one will ever find them.  This kind of fits with the whole &#8220;The truth is right in front of us if we just choose to see it&#8221; mantra.</p>

				<p>I agree with many of the other people&#8211;despite many suggestions, there aren&#8217;t much more &#8220;fair&#8221; ways of distributing it than random.

				<p>Here are some suggestions (you might combine them):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Donate the available books to some schools of your choice. Probably the best way to ensure they get read as much as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sign them, then auction them on Ebay. Donate the profits to an organization of your choice (school, OpenSSL etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use them as extra incentive for the security conferences you&#8217;re attending (i.e. one signed book for the best question from the audience).</p>

				<p>A copy to Clive &#8230; but with the condition he has to write a review.  I think we&#8217;d all enjoy reading that, and it could be published (Amazon, dead-tree press etc.)</p>
<p>Send another copy to Ross Anderson, and ask him to set his security engineering class to writing critical reviews which also suggest the next areas of research based on Liars and Outliers.  Publish these (like Ross&#8217; paper on  crowdsourcing the UK national lottery).</p>
<p>Repeat for other interesting groups: NSA, TSA, Stanford U., Harvard U., Chaos Computer Club, IBM Research, Microsoft Research, Royal Holloway London.  But remember they have to promise to publish the reviews and the suggestions for next steps.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I&#8217;ve already got a copy on pre-order from Amazon so (kudos aside) I don&#8217;t actually need another one.</p>

				<p>(Forgive me for not reading all the other comments, but I wanted to give you my unvarnished thoughts)&#8230;</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230;  Not necessarily everyone who reads the blog would be a good candidate to get a copy of the book &#8211; because some simply don&#8217;t have the time or more detailed interest to read it&#8230;  You want to give out the book to people who will read it, not to those who will just put it on the shelf unopened.  Your winners should ideally share what they have read across their organizations or circles of associates, even if they are not writing formal reviews.</p>
<p>This suggests that you should award books to people who actually ask for them (not a random drawing from everyone who reads the blog) and will commit to sharing their experience reading it with others!  You probably also want them to let others read their copy too &#8211; since what you and your publisher really want to generate is more &#8220;buzz&#8221; about the book &#8211; that this will accomplish.</p>
<p>A random selection of people who have asked for it is probably pretty fair, otherwise you&#8217;ll get people writing in claiming that they&#8217;re hugely influential in some context &#8211; without any way to verify any such claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would you like a copy of the book&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;Who will you plan to share your experience reading it with&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;How fast can you read it and share it with others&#8221;?</p>
<p>O.K. &#8211; the last one&#8217;s more of a joke &#8211; but you get the idea!</p>
<p>By the way, I&#8217;d love a copy of the book, will share my experience reading it with everyone I know (including my cat), and will read it quickly and share it with anyone who would like to read it too!  -:)</p>

We have to deserve this honor, for example, Bruce can submit an exercise and the best of us win. We will demonstrate our big interest in the crypto domain.</p>

				<p>This is the best approach &#8230; and it involves liars, and outliers, and maths (from Bruce&#8217;s past). Perfect!</p>
<p>-People enter by submitting two numbers, each from 0 to 1, each to a maximum of 5 decimal places.<br />
-Bruce lies 🙂 because he&#8217;s not interested in both numbers, so he&#8217;ll ignore one &#8211; leaving just one number per person, but he won&#8217;t tell you which one he;s going to delete.<br />
-He will then calculate the average of all the remaining submissions, and take 75% of that<br />
&#8211; The 10-20 people who are closest to that number will win the book.</p>
<p>This creates an outlier effect, because everyone knows they need to be near the &#8216;75% of average&#8217; so they are trying to guess others&#8217; entries and be even lower than that, whcih in turn pushes the average even lower.</p>
<p>Slightly more complex than previous replies, but I think mathematically interesting. IMHO.</p>

				<p>Start a project on kickstarter to produce a book on computer security for kids, or somethign else that is fun and useful and that you would be excellent at. Give away a copy of your current book to each person who pledges 100 dollars or more.  If you are feeling generous, give everything over a certain amount to Change Congress.  That should get some google fu.</p>

				<p>Both GoodReads and LibraryThing have programs for distributing ARCs (and even copies of the published book) to readers who are then expected to provide a review.  These are avid readers who are committed to interacting on those sites.</p>
<p>So, if your goal is to obtain feedback from &#8220;regular folks,&#8221; those are by far the best options. Subsequent posting of the &#8220;contest&#8221; via social media would ensure word got out.</p>
<p>The advantage to using these two social media channels is that those who participate are from a broad spectrum of lifestyles and careers. The one thing they have in common is a love of books and of sharing what they read with others.</p>

Sorry to ping you through your blog, but I&#8217;ve only been here a month and the IT guys are having a hard time setting up my access. I&#8217;m trying to schedule the French translation of Liars/Outliars here with our near-shore team up in Montreal and I need to get a digital copy ASAP to get them moving on this. Email me at the above. As you know, the holiday period is approaching and timelines are tight &#8211; need to maximise the reach for the Christmas period. Being the security conscious guy you are, you can call me on my NY number*:  1-900 123456</p>

				<p>Judging by the number of comments in just a few short hours, any subjective method will be a logistical challenge.  So, that is what I am suggesting.</p>
<p>Of all the ideas and comments (and there are some good ones), Steven W. Orr&#8217;s impassioned plea for a free copy stands out.  Not because of his economic plight, but because it gives us a glimpse at the perspective of someone who reads Bruce Schneier&#8217;s books and it begs the question; &#8220;Who really does read this stuff?&#8221;  Let&#8217;s face it, the target demographic for Liars and Outliers is not those who understand how to implement a tweakable block cipher.</p>
<p>Here is my suggestion:</p>
<p>Let people give you examples of the perspectives of your readers.</p>
<p>Then, to mitigate the logistical nightmare, give books to the first submissions, or the best submissions until you get bored, or a random sampling of submissions.  Then post the submissions so that we (your readers) can see where we fit.<br />
This solution gives you complete control (well&#8230; it might feel like control).  It gives your readers a glimpse of each other. And it gives the publisher fodder for the first few pages of your next book.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it gives me (and to be fair, Steven W. Orr) an advance copy of the book.  (I can buy one when it comes out, I just don&#8217;t want to wait).</p>

				<p>What about this. Of all the people named as subscribers to your newsletter, use a simple random number generator based on clock timing pulses to pick each name out of the database, storing the order in which each name was picked. So it would go (1) Jones, (2) Allen, (3) Wurz, (4) &#8230; etc for example.</p>
<p>Then, having stored all these original names&#8217; orders, do the same thing again from the original database list, but with a different number order, but this time without having to store the order, just check to see whether a name and number in this iteration are the same as in the saved list.</p>
<p>E.G. Second order :(1) Smith, (2) Davis, (3) Stein, &#8230;</p>
<p>If they are, then decrement the counter by one from 20, remove that name from the pool and continue until the counter reaches zero.</p>
<p>Statistically, you are very unlikely to pick out the same name at the same position each time, although this will eventually happen, thereby providing you with your list of twenty people who have been touched by the hand of providence.</p>

				<p>In the spirit of The DailyWTF, and as mentioned above, collect anecdotes from people on this blog who already &#8220;get it,&#8221; but have <i>something valuable that you can add to a speaking tour for the book</i>.  This makes it easier to promote the book and encourages folks to come and hear unique twists no one would know unless they read thousands of comments per week.  Submitters could post anonymously, but would need to leave a valid e-mail by which you could contact them further, even if the mail drop was hotmail/GMail.</p>

				<p><b>The contestants write stories, songs or poems or anything like it about security.</b><br />
<b>Here&#8217;s some non-random selection methods:</b></p>
<p>You publish a random quote from the book. The best guess about the context wins one.</p>
<p>You publish a random quote from the book. The funniest guess about the context wins one.</p>
<p>The best story about (legitimately) bypassing some security measure wins one.<br />
This could be about how you got in your apartment after locking yourself out, getting that transfer through that your bank blocked for no reason, how you bypassed your own computer firewall after forgetting your password, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>The best suggested security measure for whatever wins one.<br />
It could be your method of locking your bike (I have three locks and always locks both wheels to the frame and the whole thing to something that can&#8217;t be moved), a way to keep your computer safe, how to transport a billion dollars, how to do this contest without revealing the identities of the contestants and yet getting the books to them, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>The best song wins one.</p>
<p>The best fictional security story wins one.<br />
It can be strange, funny, clever, anything else or all of it at once. Considering the average reader here, I guess it&#8217;ll end up being a Sci-Fi story.</p>
<p>The best suggestion for how to socially engineer you to get a copy wins one.</p>
<p>The best motiviation for why one need the book wins one.<br />
This can be anything, such as for school work or if you&#8217;re aspiring to be the next Bruce Schneier.</p>
<p>The best description of how one will use the book wins one.<br />
Teaching the CEO about security?</p>
<p>The best description of how to randomly select a winner gets one.</p>
<p>The person who makes the best suggestion for who needs a copy wins one.<br />
The TSA? Sony CEO&#8217;s? Somebody else that were involved with failed security? The best motivation wins.</p>
<p>The funniest story about how the staff involved in a security breach must have thought wins one.<br />
&#8220;Red alert? Meh, we get those all the time, it&#8217;s nothing. There hasn&#8217;t been any explosions yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>You pick one story that you really like. Pick any way you want, as long as it&#8217;s not just randomly. Maybe one that made you laugh or one that&#8217;s really interesting.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, that&#8217;s 13 non-random suggestions. A very fine prime number, although many people irrationally fear it, as if it was the cause of many insecurities itself. 🙂</p>
<p><b>Now, here&#8217;s 7 random methods &#8211; another very fine prime number &#8211; that you can use:</b><br />
First of all, you select +20 entries, obviously, for the ones where an entry is selected randomly from the contestants.</p>
<p>This guy picks one: <a href="http://www.geekologie.com/2011/12/skills-lizard-playing-ant-crusher-on-sma.php" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.geekologie.com/2011/12/skills-lizard-playing-ant-crusher-on-sma.php</a><br />
Just make an app with a list of entries (flies can represent entries), and get him to pick one.</p>
<p>A squid picks one by the same method (also touching one entry on a touch screen).</p>
<p>Generate a hash tree at random, the type where one hash matches many entries (just generate random bits).<br />
The first email adress among the subscribers of your news letter that match it wins one. If there&#8217;s no response, try another address. If no email matches or nobody responds, you generate a new hash tree at random.</p>
<p>Put one in a locked box, put it in a public place. It could say &#8220;Bruce Schneier&#8217;s latest book inside, first person to open this box gets it&#8221; on it.<br />
The box should have the strangest locking mechanism you can find. Make sure plain brute force is too hard to be worth it.</p>
<p>Print them all on pieces of paper (only the good entries). Put them on the floor in some large place. Throw a rubber ball in there, the entry it stays on or stays closest too wins one.</p>
<p>Assign random numbers to all entries, make sure there&#8217;s no collisions. Ask a stranger to say some random number. If the number doesn&#8217;t correspond to that of any entry, try again. The entry who&#8217;s number is selected wins.</p>
<p>And of course, the best suggestion for how to do it randomly is used. The person who is selected that way wins.</p>

				<p>Hi Bruce!</p>
<p>How about &#8220;freeing&#8221; your copies instantly by using and registering them via BookCrossing (<a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.bookcrossing.com/</a>)?</p>
<p>So you could leave them one by one simply at some places you visit and distribution does not require you anymore to select people.<br />
Further doing that you might reach people who are interested, but would have not come across your work the &#8220;usual&#8221; way.</p>
<p>Best, Thomas.</p>

				<p>Send Bruce a number by a time that Bruce specifies (gives every time zone a chance to participate). Bruce will hash that number with an algorithm and salt that he will reveal (to enable verification) after the deadline. The resulting hashes will be sorted, and the highest n will receive a book.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sort of like the lottery, but with cryptography! 🙂</p>

				<p>Your book is about trust &#8211; Give the galleys to those who best demonstrate that they trust YOU.</p>
<p>Step 1.  Publish a paypal &#8220;pay&#8221; link and a &#8220;transfer amount&#8221; &#8211; say $1024.  First 20 who &#8220;transfer&#8221; you $1024 get a book, but everyone who submits payment gets their money refunded &#8211; except no guarantees.  If money is &#8220;transferred&#8221; but nothing is &#8220;sold&#8221;, paypal has no transaction fee.</p>
<p>Step 2. Next day, if books are still available, drop &#8220;transfer amount&#8221; by factor of two to $512.  Continue until books are gone.</p>
<p>Oh, and step 0: consult a lawyer. And talk about it with Paypal ahead of time.</p>
<p>By starting with a fairly high &#8220;transfer amount&#8221; (not &#8220;price&#8221;) you should keep the number of transactions small enough that this wouldn&#8217;t be a lot of effort on your part, and the whole process would give you something interesting to write about.  Maybe generate some &#8220;buzz&#8221;.</p>

				<p>Have we done a &#8220;Security Theater/Theatre&#8221; recently?  Those are always fun and a great way to do a contest.  Otherwise, a &#8220;guess which number I&#8217;m thinking about&#8221; with 10-20 numbers in a given range would be a fun test in brute force (obviously this would require some limiting factor on submitters or a single brute forcer would get all 10-20 copies).</p>

				<p>an essay contest. have entries of no more than x number of words written over a topic in the information security field, something current and nothing can be used/referenced from anything you have already written. this way those who enter can still write over anything relevant, yet still writing entirely in their own words.<br />
winner is the one who best demonstrates their idea of what happened and a solution across.</p>

				<p>I like the time-zone distribution &#8211; it seems easy  enough to do.  A short script should give the winners. Contests are too time-consuming.  24 copies is not much of a stretch.</p>
<p>But which reader from each time-zone?   Qualifiers should be subscribers to crypto-gram &#8211; that seems obvious.</p>
<p>Additional qualifiers?</p>
<p>Earliest cryptogram or blog subscriber from that time-zone?</p>
<p>Facebook member likes you?</p>
<p>Crypto community members &#8211; maybe.</p>
<p>First, 10th or  24th (or last if less than 10 or 24  from a single time zone, which seems not likely).</p>
<p>As for me, I&#8217;m putting it on my Amazon wish list.</p>

				<p>I like the &#8220;liars/outliers&#8221; themes suggested by some, MythBusters style take somethign that on the outside seems probable, but when you look at it, really is just the statistical outlier and isn&#8217;t really all that likely (&#8220;Probable&#8221; or &#8220;Plausible&#8221; in MythBuster-ese)!</p>

				<p>Use two methods: GeoCache + Random</p>
<p>Place half the books around country (or world) and publish their geocached locations  hidden within the security puzzles of your choice.  Anonymous readers get a chance at retrieving a book without ever posting.  Requires both skill and luck.</p>
<p>Randomly give the other half to non-anonymous commenters to this blog. Interested, but possibly non-expert readers, get a chance at winning just by &#8220;showing up&#8221;.</p>

				<p>CML should win!</p>
<blockquote><p>
Your book is about trust &#8211; Give the galleys to those who best demonstrate that they trust YOU.</p>
<p>Step 1. Publish a paypal &#8220;pay&#8221; link and a &#8220;transfer amount&#8221; &#8211; say $1024. First 20 who &#8220;transfer&#8221; you $1024 get a book, but everyone who submits payment gets their money refunded &#8211; except no guarantees. If money is &#8220;transferred&#8221; but nothing is &#8220;sold&#8221;, paypal has no transaction fee.</p>
<p>Step 2. Next day, if books are still available, drop &#8220;transfer amount&#8221; by factor of two to $512. Continue until books are gone.</p>
<p>Oh, and step 0: consult a lawyer. And talk about it with Paypal ahead of time.</p>
<p>By starting with a fairly high &#8220;transfer amount&#8221; (not &#8220;price&#8221;) you should keep the number of transactions small enough that this wouldn&#8217;t be a lot of effort on your part, and the whole process would give you something interesting to write about. Maybe generate some &#8220;buzz&#8221;.

				<p>Hi Bruce!</p>
<p>Your best 2 options are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just pick a random comment here &#8211; there are so many already sifting through them&#8217;s going to be a nightmare.</li>
<li>Have a quiz/poll/one-question kind of multiple choice related to security/trust/etc. and give copies away to a random person who gets it right.  You could do a question or two a day or something, so that system would work for all X copies you&#8217;ll be giving away.</li>
</ol>
<p>PS &#8211; I love that you&#8217;re not doing the Facebook/Twitter thing&#8230; it would be a little too ironic to award people for using such &#8216;insecure&#8217; and anti-privacy systems like those for a security book.</p>

				<p>I like both WDS and Greg&#8217;s responses&#8230;</p>
<p>WDS&#8217;s involved picking the best suggestions from all the blog posts about the book.  I suggest taking the same set but picking at random.  All of the blog posts about the book (previous to this one) and then randomly pick a comment.</p>
<p>Another alternative (inspired by Greg&#8217;s idea) is to use something similar to panopticlick.eff.org/ and give it to people with the most identifying browser characteristics.</p>

<p>This idea is that you publicly announce a future source of entropy, determine and enumerate the candidate pool, and specify the algorithm for applying the entropy to choose the candidates. It will be completely random and verifiably above board.</p>
<p>If you want your selectees to have particular qualities (i.e. have written a book review before), you just need to select for that quality beforehand when developing your candidate pool.</p>

				<p>1) Auction with the price as a donation to EEF. Winners are not highest bidder, but randomly selected from the pool of entries with the chance to win proportional to your bid price, and you pay the price you bid if you win.</p>
<p>2) People post a note about the book on Twitter, Facebook, G+, etc. They submit the URL for the post, which must be public. A parser could make sure the book name appears in visible text, and randomly selects winning entries using <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits</a> as the random data source.</p>
<p>-MpH</p>
<p>P. S. I also like the pictures of poor security idea, and the skein hash idea. Tweak on the hash choose N hash schemes [N=number of copies], one winner per scheme. Tweak on the 3 words: 4 words: Wet Squid T-Shirt Contest [pedagogically: is that 4 or 5 words?]</p>

				<p>If you want to show favoritism towards those who comment on your blog, then use the number of blog entries as a criteria.</p>
<p>If you want to give the book to people who READ your newsletter (as opposed to receiving it), and are interested in the book, then pick randomly from those who reply to a blog directly related to giving away the book (like this one).</p>
<p>Or you can pick randomly from those who receive your newsletter.</p>
<p>Or you can give them to your favorite bloggers.</p>
<p>Congrats, and good luck.</p>

				<p>Bruce,</p>
<p>Thanks for not asking for &#8220;likes&#8221; or &#8220;tweets.&#8221;  I always find that shameless and tasteless (almost as much so as Facebook and Twitter themselves).</p>
<p>Regarding the books; Drexel University has one of the first really high quality Information Security majors in the country.  We recently hired a grad of the program, and he&#8217;s been outstanding and had a reasonably developed security mindset from when he started.</p>
<p>I say up the # of books a tad, and donate a whole set to Drexel&#8217;s current InfoSec class.  If that&#8217;s too much $$, make them Kindle books, I&#8217;m sure they could work with that.</p>
<p>PS: I&#8217;ll pay 20 bucks for it personally.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m not a loyal enough reader to merit a free copy, so even if I win, please give it to someone else.</p>
<p>I do enjoy your site, but I assume by now you have a set of enthusiastic and helpful commenters who have enhanced your thinking on security. You probably already know who they are, or could come up with a reasonable set of names based on their prior contributions. This is the group that would appreciate and deserve free copies.</p>

				<p>While this isn&#8217;t exactly a way to give away copies, you may want to consider trying to get your book &#8220;banned.&#8221; That would do more to insure brisk sales than anything else&#8230;</p>

				<p>Create a cryptographic hash function based off a well-known existing one. Tell everyone what the original hash function was. The first 10-20 people who can submit a string whose hash begins with as much of a substring of DEADBEEF as possible win the book copies.</p>
<p>Every day put 100 random strings through the hash function, and publish the inputs/outputs.</p>
<p>Run this contest for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>At the end of it, give out the books.</p>
<p>Clearly some people will just win randomly, like their input string will hash to DEA0F7. But others will figure out how you&#8217;ve modified the hash function and modify theirs similarly, and thus be able to do a brute force &#8220;attack&#8221; on it, generating strings that hash to DEADBE5G. Those people will pretty much be guaranteed to win a copy of the book.</p>
<p>Also, the person who comes up with the most creative excuse about how they have a string that hashes to DEADBEEF but can&#8217;t prove it wins a copy of the book for being a good liar.</p>

				<p>I am glad you decided against a Facebook giveaway, not only Facebook is a privacy abusing company, it also encourages people to put out their personal details on the Internet as if it was nothing to worry about, not to mention that some of us do not have an account.</p>
<p>Regarding the give away, my idea would be to get people to post one security tip on your blog with the understanding that if chosen, it can be reposted by you on your next book, this way everyone gets something for something, including you.</p>

				<p>Hopefully this hasn&#8217;t been mentioned before, just too many comments to read! How about giving out the copies to the top 20 people that have subscribed to your newsletter the longest?</p>

				<p>This is obvious;  you need the best product placement of your book in either a security movie plot or in a proposed piece of security theatre:</p>
<p>Jenny had not long joined the kindergartern  protection group;  set up in the wake of the self engineered flu virus scare, the group was able to reach any location in the 48 continguous states within 20 minutes;  they carried with them a self replicating machine detector; 10 tonnes of heavy weapons and a copy each of &#8220;Liars and Outliers&#8221;;  Jenny reached for hers now.  This mission would not be easy.  The nursery teacher they were going to arrest had been a member of the &#8220;Occupy&#8221; movement before they had been crushed in &#8217;22; had spent years in a camp withut any proof of having reformed and would be well versed in the arts of deception.  She couldn&#8217;t understand how such a person could end up in charge of the most vulnerable children.  Maybe Schneier would give her a hint;  a year of their basic training had been spent studying it, but she still found new things in the text every time she opened it.</p>
<p>P.S. My entry is in for both possible competitions.</p>
<p>P.P.S. If you read through to this comment you are my hero; even if you don&#8217;t give me the book 🙂</p>

				<p>I recommend you give them to those who comment regularly and add meaning to the conversation here.</p>
<p>I post every year or so, but I do read the comments. You&#8217;ve got several devoted commentators who deserve it, and even I can figure out who some of the would be.</p>

				<p>Bruce,<br />
When I&#8217;ve had copies of my books to &#8220;give away&#8221;, I&#8217;ve done it only under certain circumstances:<br />
1. Talks on specifics. It is good to reward people who actually <em>bother</em> to come to see you discuss a technical issue of interest. I&#8217;ve done it for OS kernel and datacenter issues.<br />
2. Students who do work in the field. Now, I know students don&#8217;t rate high on the marketer&#8217;s list, but students can rarely afford such a book. It cultivates a loyal following.<br />
3. A few times, I&#8217;ve had someone submit code that is really great. And they got a book and a thank you.</p>
<p>Congratulations on your latest book.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Lynne.</p>

				<p>My proposal for how to give way and ecopy of draft copies of your new book is to use MerlinEZ (I will give you a code to download a free copy) to encrypt it.</p>
<p>MerlinEZ requires a CryptoFile, which is any type of file. MerlinEZ will automatically choose what part of that file (up to about 1Mb) to use as an encryption key.</p>
<p>Then you notify the recipients of where the CryptoFile is by placing it on a web site of your choice where there is no link to it.</p>
<p>Then contact each and recipient tell them the URL which will download the file (a picture a sound file, a spreadsheet, &#8230;) and save it.</p>
<p>The last step is for them to download the free MerlinReader decryption program to decrypt the encrypted book draft using the downloaded CryptoFile.</p>
<p>To send people the link to get MerlinReader go to:<br />

				<p>Please may I have a signed copy of your new book? Thank you.<br />
Now just tell everyone you gave me a copy (or not) because I asked nicely. Then, sell as many as you can and give away as many as you want however YOU want to! That&#8217;s it. You don&#8217;t need our help. It is interesting to see all the comments though isn&#8217;t it!<br />

				<p>Step 1: Ask anyone who is interested in a free copy to email you (or, perhaps, submit via CGI form) their full name and mailing address.</p>
<p>Step 2: Generate a cryptographic digest of their name / address information.</p>
<p>Step 3: Perform some sort of operation on the digest, such as reversing it, slicing it and re-combining it, etc. (Save it as a unique key for the name / address record.)</p>
<p>Step 4: After all entries are received, ASCII-order the unique key (modified digests). First ten in the list get a free book.</p>

				<p>This is my idea: Make a little game with all the books that you are giving away. Put a small table on the first blank page of the book, so it has Name + City/State/Country + Relationship to the next person.</p>
<p>Now, give the books to 10 random people to read it. They should put their data and then pass it to someone whom they &#8220;trust&#8221;, but not necessarily they &#8220;know&#8221; (this shor instruction should be also on the book). After, say, the 10th reader, he/she should send it back to the editor. You, when you receive the books back, could see how the people trust each other in real life, even to recommend reading a book they would probably not take it in the bookstore&#8230;.</p>

				<p>I recommend figuring out a way to get the addresses from anyone who wants to participate and then include everyone.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Everyone registers their email address in an online document (use throwaway ones!).</p>
<p>You grab the first x based on random sorting (matching the number of books to distribute).</p>
<p>Those people get sent books (email for phone number, someone then speaks and gets address).</p>
<p>Those people get the book, sign it and add location and date, read it then find the next willing recipient in the online doc and send it to them.</p>
<p>That way, the books get to travel the world and we spread the love.  We can also track which books get to where.</p>
<p>Yes, some finer detail is missing but that&#8217;s the gist of it 🙂</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be buying one from the place where you get the best kickback btw 🙂</p>

				<p>This may be a duplicate as I gave up reading about 1/2 way through. Obviously the offer of a free copy is a massive incentive.</p>
<p>There are a few participants in this blog&#8217;s comments who regularly post insightful useful entries. You know who they are. I suggest you just pick the people who&#8217;s comments you look forward to reading and send them a copy.</p>

				<p>As a variant on the Security Theatre poster idea, ask for submissions for a Security Theatre (or similarly themed) T-shirt design for your loyal readers.</p>
<p>Reward the best designs with galley copies of your book, reward the rest of us (and keep the publicists happy) by submitting the best design(s) to Threadless.com to make and sell the T-Shirts.</p>
<p>If DefCon, 2600 and Black Hat can all have cool shirts, so can we. Heck, I&#8217;d buy one for each of my Dev staff.</p>

				<p>Liar detection is hard to automate, so I suggest picking outliers. Send books to the people who have posted the most number of comments on your blog, but have NOT posted in THIS comment thread. It should be a fairly easy query to write.<br />

				<p>Put out a call for &#8220;the best way to give out a free galley copy of Liars and Outliers.&#8221;  Discard the most common responses and take only the really ludicrous responses. (The outlier responses, if you will.)</p>

				<p>Use a scheme that requires geocaching to find a copy. If you are the first one at the site, you must leave a book of similar type and value. Each person who finds the site(s) takes a book and leaves one.</p>

				<p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>Since I published some books myself, self-publish via CreateSpace to be more precise, I couldn’t help, but to response to your call for suggestions.</p>
<p>I found that from all the books I gave away, only a fraction was read and appreciated. Actually, after some time I felt that my intention could be misinterpreted as a pathetic strive for some publicity.</p>
<p>In your situation, I would ask the readers of your Crypto-Gram, if, and then why, they find the subject of your book interesting. From the received replies I would draw randomly and every copy of the book I would sign. In the wording I would try to include some specifics from that particular reader’s submission.</p>
<p>At this year’s ending, I would like to thank you for sharing with us your knowledge during the last year and for all the issues of your Crypto-Gram, which are very much appreciated.</p>
<p>Wishing you all the best in 2012,</p>
<p>George</p>

				<p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>1) Let &#8216;n&#8217; be the number of copies you want to give away;</p>
<p>2) Let &#8216;L&#8217; be the number of received messages;</p>
<p>3) Merge all the received messages in one file;</p>
<p>4) From the file in step 3, create &#8216;n&#8217; files with a text message &#8216;n&#8217; appended to each one;</p>
<p>5) Let X[n] = MD5(file(n));</p>
<p>6) Let Y[n] be the 2 leftmost hexadecimal digits of X[n];</p>
<p>7) Send copy n to the message Y[n] mod L;</p>

				<p>&#8220;The best way to give away free galley copies of Liars and Outliars is to hold a contest where you ask for the person who can come up with the best way to give away free galley copies of Liars and Outliers&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is that only gives away one copy.  I can&#8217;t think of a good way to make it recursive.</p>

				<p>There was always the rumor that my professors graded papers by throwing them down the stairs. The ones that landed at the bottom got an A (having more momentum by being heavier, you know), on the first stair a B, and so on. Perhaps something similar would work for you. 😉</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve thought about this, too.  If I do it, it will be for two or three copies &#8212; not for all 20.  Choosing people solely based on willingness to pay doesn&#8217;t seem ideal.</p>

				<p>&#8220;I just think you&#8217;re lying when you say that you&#8217;re going to give away free copies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Honestly, it&#8217;s not worth the trouble to lie about it.</p>
<p>Wiley has earmarked 20 copies of the galley for the specific purposes of giving to blog readers.  This is in addition to the copies of the book that will be sent to book reviewers.  (And the galleys only have limited value; after the book is published people are going to want that one.)</p>

				<p>&#8220;You already have the e-mail addresses for everyone on the distribution list for your monthly newsletter CRYPTO-GRAM. Just randomly select the persons that win a copy of your new book from that list.&#8221;</p>
<p>There two problems with the use the Crypto-Gram mailing list solutions.  One, it leaves out people who read me on this blog and not in e-mail.  And two, I don&#8217;t know whether a Crypto-Gram subscriber actually reads my newsletter. It might go into a spam trap, it might be a dead e-mail box, etc.</p>

				<p>Yay, Schneier responses!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some more additions to my previous suggestions (in case not all the ones I posted before was good enough):</p>
<p>The best description of the most insane security system (by any means) that worked wins a copy.</p>
<p>The best description of the most crazy just-for-fun not-actually-intended-to-be-used security system that actually worked wins one.</p>
<p>The first people to respond to Schneier&#8217;s responses wins one. Oh, that type of selection were already ruled out? Huh, too bad for me. 😉</p>
<p>The best description of the most elaborate home-made security system wins one. (Has to be funny in some way.)</p>

				<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give any copies away, but say that you did (liar).  Then, give copies to the first N people to call you on it (outliers).&#8221;</p>

				<p>Suggestion on how to pick recipients:</p>
<p>The goal seems to be to raise the bar by requiring opt-in style participation, but still require minimal work (e.g. not reading hundreds of limericks, unsolicited blurbs, jokes, etc. and judging them on merit).</p>
<p>I have had success in similar enterprises running a simple lottery:<br />
a) create a disposable gmail account, e.g. <a href="mailto:landocontest@gmail.com">landocontest@gmail.com</a><br />
b) over a 24-hour period, would be recipients email an N-digit random number (as subject), blank body, to that account<br />
c) after 24 hours, enable filter to route &#8220;late&#8221; messages to trash<br />
d) generate a winning number by preferred method; start winners list with top N of those who guessed that number<br />
e) if you don&#8217;t have enough winners, generate a second random winning number; repeat until winners list is full.</p>
<p>This method does require a disposable account, but with the anectodal side benefit that you can examine the distribution of guesses (very modal in my experience).</p>
<p>Good luck!<br />

				<p>Slight improvement: in lieu of blank body in email, have people submit their desired mailing address for their copy.</p>
<p>That way, you have the addresses of winners on hand as you pick them.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you give it to the people who had the most valuable comments when you were soliciting feedback on your choice of title for the book?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is my favorite so far.  It requires me to go back and read the 2-3 threads where we talked about titles, but that&#8217;s not too much work.</p>

				<p>&#8220;I liked the postcard idea. Pick a date that you have to receive them by and then choose the pictures you like best from the cards that you&#8217;ve received.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is kind of a nice idea.</p>
<p>Or how about I ask readers to send me &#8220;three box tops,&#8221; specifying nothing further about the nature of the box tops.  Most interesting sets of box tops win.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Give the book to the people that can guess the number of times you have written the word &#8216;terrorism&#8217; in the book. Those first 20 who can come close, gets a copy.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not bad.  I could make the contest more complicated, by asking people to guess the prevalence of several different words: terrorism, outliers, trust, reputation, and squid.</p>

				<p>A contest to bring to light security issues distinct from but growing with modern technology would be better, I think.  E.g., how to verify the identity of a supposed authority or individual, or how to avoid eavesdroppers and having your letters read.</p>
<p>These concepts permeate into every level of society, even if you&#8217;ve never seen a computer, though much more so if you have.  Short Schneier-like posts could bring attention and perspective to modern manifestations that are not well known.</p>
<p>Not only does this generate relevant content for your website, but the contest and the content both help to engage the broader community, especially in the time leading up to and shortly after the book publication.</p>

				<p>Two thoughts on the contest:</p>
<p>== [1] ==<br />
Ask for people to write a convincing (##-word or less) essay/paragraph on whether they are a Liar or an Outlier.</p>
<p>I look forward to reading all of the &#8220;I&#8217;m a liar&#8221; entries to see how far people take them, and all the &#8220;I&#8217;m an outlier&#8221; entries to spot the liars that are just too accustomed to lying to admit that they are liars. 😀</p>
<p>Or:<br />
== [2] ==<br />
Something to do with shared risk of a group &#8211; allow people to leave a comment saying &#8220;I want to be part of The Book Group ##&#8221;, and if the number of people that have left a comment to be in Book Group 1 exceeds the number of books, then that group DOES NOT get the books. So, anyone that leaves a comment after you can sabotage the group. Whichever group comes closest to the number of books that you have left once you&#8217;ve donated some to the EFF or TSA or whatever is the winning group. This does have the risk of having too many groups being exactly the right number, but it also adds an element of group trust, and how easy it is to break it. Shared risk and all that. 😀</p>

				<p>I&#8217;d pick people that would agree to pass the book on after they have read it so there is some generalized reciprocity. If just 4.74 people pay it forward, perhaps even Kevin Bacon could learn about the relationship between security, trust, and society.</p>

				<p>I think you should slip the books into the luggage of unsuspecting strangers at the airport.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun, amusing, and a little bit subversive.  I don&#8217;t know if it would qualify you as an outlier but it might earn the book a little extra street cred when people find out/you get arrested&#8230; wait were these supposed to be reasonable ideas?</p>
<p>How about having people write their idea for the first line of the book and the one that is closest to the real thing plus your favorites each get a copy of the book.</p>

				<p>There are lots of interesting ideas that involve randomness here&#8230; whichever one you choose, if you end up needing randomness I think you should use the TRNG at random.org to give their educational side a bit of exposure and to have fun using real randomness from the Actual Universe.</p>
<p>In the end, you&#8217;re going to have to find a method you can feel good about having done, which probably involves your assessment of the community here and your relationships with the individual contributors (which, sadly, rules me out since I generally have time only to consume information, not add value here.). If you end up with more than 20 candidates, use random.org and write about it. 🙂</p>
<p>BTW, so long as I have this comment form going, thanks for all of the excellent signal you add to the web. You improve the signal to noise ratio out here immensely.</p>

<p>Obviously you&#8217;re an outlier if you try, and you&#8217;re probably also a liar if you  succed. Because seriously, who&#8217;s gonna go ahead and let you put a tank with a squid in their bosses&#8217; office? (Unless you could convince them it&#8217;s really hilarious enough.)</p>

				<p>Have people submit anagrams based on the title of the book, or your name, or something else of your choosing.  Pick the entries you like most, for whatever reason.  And share the submitted anagrams with us.  That would be fun, and a little cryptic.  Just a thought.</p>

				<p>I think that it would be best to give any free books to people who are definitely likely to read it. Most people hardly ever read books and giving a great book to someone who doesn&#8217;t read it is like throwing pearls before swine.</p>
<p>So I suggest that free books be given to people who write a short passage about their thoughts on the subject matter so that they can really prove that they are interested in the topic and therefore likely to read and appreciate the book.</p>

				<p>Set up an electronic prediction market in which bloggers try to predict which bloggers will get books (allowing people to vote for up to 10 bloggers).</p>
<p>Give books to the 10 most highly voted for bloggers and the other 10 to the voters who made the best predictions.</p>

				<p>After reading some and seeing the vast number of suggestions already given, it is clear that this offer is a substantial motivator.  With all the submissions that come from a submission based process, it is reasonable to hand the decision process over to a properly motivated society/group of people.  it is also desirable to have the results of the process further security in the most sensible way.  Because sensible security is to protect the freest evolution of society, have the books go towards the best suggestions and/or implementations in this direction.  Thus the entries need to be valued in how well they dynamically fulfill the balance of protection against destruction of created value while still enabling future creation of value (such as the arising of new leadership ) in any given living context.  Let various groups of volunteers  set up the website interfaces or other means to enable the participation of entry makers  and decision makers &#8230; the way they set up and run such interfaces can also be considered as entries for prize.  The various groups can also evaluate each other in this regard.  Then it can be interesting to see what kind of a consensus or divergence of evaluations arise&#8230; The groups that start with the book bonus motivation may well find sufficient intrinsic meaning in their endeavors to want to extend them beyond solving the gift distribution issue.  The solutions may be become generic group distributive evaluation systems with a broad realm of application beyond security issues.  They could be open source licensed or given as freeware.   And the one who thought of all this should get one book for this initial thread.  Thank you, it will be well treasured.  By the way, it could be that you, Bruce, will win one of the books for your writing the book.  And for you to receive your book in this fashion could indeed be of a special and ironic meaning to you.</p>

				<p>Gonzo nailed it: &#8220;I think the only logical way to give away free copies of your book is to give it to TSA screeners while you travel. Then, when you come back through the airport, ask them what they thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the lazy man&#8217;s approach.  If you want to be sure it gets read, ask to speak to a TSA supervisor and then give the supervisor the book.</p>
<p>Better yet: ask the supervisor at the departing airport to autograph it and then give it to the checkpoint supervisor at your destination airport.</p>

				<p>Bruce expressed interest in auctioning a few copies, so I re-iterate my &#8220;proportional bid auction&#8221; idea so that copies don&#8217;t just goes the person with the means to pay the most.</p>
<p>1) Auction with the price as a donation to EEF. Winners are not highest bidder, but randomly selected from the pool of entries with the chance to win proportional to your bid price, and you pay the price you bid if you win. Some copies will cost a lot and some will go inexpensively.</p>
<p>[Or this: I figure each copy is about 300 pages and there about 20 galley proofs available to give away. By the time this thread tapers off I&#8217;ll bet there will be about 6000 comments. I&#8217;m sure it is no coincidence the math works out equal. Send each commenter one page.]</p>

				<p>Ask for small proof of motivation/interest, and distribute based on age (20 youngest persons), as for younger persons that could be greater inspiration to think and act in future. That could actually inspire their career.</p>
<p>Of course that would disqualify myself 🙂</p>
<p>The only problem would be verifying actual age, so some kind of physical book transfer should take place.</p>

Anyway what if for sure &#8211; as ever &#8211; is that you make me think a lot (at dawn, french time!). And what I&#8217;ve (almost:) understood of what could bring your book to security questions in society gives great expectations and promises of others dawn+ thinking&#8230; Thanks</p>

				<p>Bruce,</p>
<p>I just want to say I have really enjoyed your monthly cryptograms for the last 8 years&#8230; ever since you were the guest speaker in the computer security class I was taking at the University of Minnesota. I commonly forward on the monthly email to family and friends as I think everyone should be informed on the issues you present.<br />
  I also have enjoyed reading Secrets and Lies and Schneier on Security&#8230; so how about a buy two get one free deal?</p>

				<p>Since the title is &#8220;Liars and outliars&#8221;, how about asking for astonishing lies your readers have manged to get away with? The lies you enjoy the most could be awarded with a copy of the book.</p>
<p>I have a few nice ones myself and I&#8217;d bet there is a veritable gold mine of funny and breathtaking lies among your readers that would be highly entertaining (which is a great part of why I&#8217;d want you to choose my idea).</p>
<p>This would also introduce an element of trust since you would have to believe your readers sincerity in their tales. And you&#8217;d have a blast picking the winners!</p>

				<p>The issue I have with CML’s idea is that it does tend to discriminate against those who do not have $1024 available.</p>
<p>Personally, I’d suggest a copy goes to someone who is prepared to read it soon and publish an informed, balanced and informative review of it for the rest of us in 500 words or less. And I would rather it went to that someone than to me.</p>

				<p>@ Bruce,</p>
<p>&#8220;What recipe do you have?&#8221;</p>
<p>Spicy Jamaica style Squid baked inside a loaf of bread.</p>
<p>It sounds a bit weird but tasts rather nice and depending how you make it (in a tin or cottage loaf style) the crust can be highly ornamental and makes a sufficient difference that even conventional &#8220;turf&#8221; munchers will try the &#8220;surf&#8221;.</p>

				<p>My suggestion is this: 1. first of all make sure that the winners will read your book, because else it&#8217;s just a waste of money !  This could for example be done by asking who would like to win and then asking for something in return, a review of the book or feedback on which chapter is the best or something like that.<br />
2. It would properly be smartest to ensure a degree of geographical spread amoungst the winners by asking about homecountry at the same time.</p>

				<p>Make a difficult contest on a subject that you have at heart, but whose difficulty would not attrack entries without a significant bounty, like those books with dedicaces.</p>
<p>I now detail an example, an underhanded contest, like <a href="http://underhanded.xcott.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://underhanded.xcott.com/</a> but with social interactions replacing the C language.</p>
<p>Each entry of this context should describe a particular mechanism to establish trust between two parties, in a precise setting in the real world. In apparence, it should be evident to the public and the expert that this mechanism cannot be abused, is fool proof, and is as simple as possible. With an invisible weakness that may be used to abuse it, explained at end of entry.</p>
<p>Example of entry: <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/07/man_flies_with.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/07/man_flies_with.html</a></p>
<p>Give the 19 books to best entries. Extra points for the entries that seem to respect the principles detailed in your book, and for those not involving computers.</p>
<p>I am not sure that this is the type of difficult contest that you have at heart, you may have a different contest in mind.</p>

				<p>Really, your books deserve reaching a wider audience than the people reading this blog.</p>
<p>Hence I would suggest the following: bookcrossing !</p>
<p>Ie. identify places where people gather who you hope would read your books (conferences, universities, maybe places where decision makers meet to discuss trust and security), and just leave a few books here and there.</p>
<p>Whether or not you want to encourage people to allow you to trace who reads these bookcrossed copies (see bookcrossing.com) is an open question. People would have to think twice about the privacy implications, which is per-se an interesting question.</p>

				<p>The point of galley copies is to spread the interest for the book before publication. So you want it to end up with &#8216;opinion leaders&#8217; before the first print edition.</p>
<p>The best way to achieve that may be by letting people hand it personally to an &#8216;opinion leader&#8217;. Their argument for which &#8216;opinion leader&#8217; they think is most important <em>and</em> needs to read this the most (could be someone who talks out of his ass on the subject) gives you a good selection criterium, as well as giving some people and excuse to visit an &#8216;opinion leader&#8217;.</p>
<p>You have 20 copies, that means you can do this 10 times (1 copy for winner, one for &#8216;opinion leader&#8217;)</p>
<p>Given how much you trust the winners, you can send them two copies, or the second copy only after they&#8217;ve given evidence of handing the first copy over to the opinion leader.</p>
<p>If you want to increase reader participation even further, let the readers decide on the winners.</p>
<p>I myself will be happy to buy the book and support your work.</p>

				<p>The idea @CML is interesting. But there are some interesting risks: If everyone who responded in this thread participates and sends $1024. Bruce won&#8217;t have to sell his book if he turns out to be the &#8216;Dishonest Minority&#8217;. 😀 Nah, he wouldn&#8217;t do that, would he?</p>
<p>I like two things: (both suggested by others)<br />
&#8211; Pick someone based on they comments the title-suggestion threads, which guarantees at least some level of interest.<br />
&#8211; Then ask them to write a short review.</p>
<p>The benefit is that it partly serves the purpose of galley copies.<br />
Then hold a poll to select the best review. Give that one (or the best x) a final copy when it gets released.</p>

				<p>First, skip my copy, because my method requires that these be given out in pairs.</p>
<p>Assign a four digit number to each of twenty books.</p>
<p>Commenters post their four digit guess.  When the sum or difference of two commenters matches a book&#8217;s number, two books are given out.  The commenters may exchange email addresses or other identity information as their choice.</p>

				<p>Whatever you do with the 20 copies, people in this blog will most probably read your book (either print/digital copies), so why not seek within population outside your blog. While not easy, there are ways: post an advertisement asking for people to proof read your book for comments (might need to use an alias and don&#8217;t provide much info about the book&#8230;)</p>
<p>Congrats on your new book, looking forward to read into it.<br />

				<p>Send me a copy, let me read/review and, and I can then make a determination on whether or not it even warrants a giveaway.  If it does warrant a giveaway, I&#8217;d suggest you pick 10 numbers between 1 and 1000, establish a deadline, and the 10 people who pick the exact, or closest number, to those 10 numbers by the deadline get copies of the book.</p>

				<p>Wow ! Many people seems to want a copy of Liars and Outliers. Good luck just to read all the comments. Here is my suggestion : take your 20 best friends, those who are not in the security business and give them a copy. Before doing so, although, save some from your children. If it&#8217;s your most ambitious book, it&#8217;s the one you may would like them to keep.<br />
PS : don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll buy it anyway 😉</p>

				<p>I dislike CML&#8217;s idea.  It&#8217;s really more a test of your trust of Paypal than your trust of Bruce.  If Bruce reneges, Paypal can give back the money.  If Bruce is honest, Paypal can somehow find a way not to give back the money or charge fees.</p>
<p>Personally, Paypal has not earned my trust.</p>
<p>Pre-emptive response: They also haven&#8217;t demonstrated enough fear of negative publicity for me to take &#8220;negative publicity&#8221; as an argument in favor of trusting them anyhow.</p>

				<p>You could give away them to people who are actively doing something related to security and/or cryptography as a hobby (may or may not be doing it professionally as well). By hobby I mean doing something that they don&#8217;t receive significant income from.</p>
<p>I.e. doing free cryptography lectures for students, writing articles on security, etc.</p>
<p>Most of such people have preordered your book or will buy anyway, but not everyone. Some of them may be from backwards countries where it&#8217;s difficult to buy anything via internet. Some of them may find the price too high compared to their earnings in their countries, and so on.</p>
<p>Applicants somehow should of course prove they are who they say they are.</p>

				<p>I wonder whether distribution of these copies could be used in a substantive test of the book&#8217;s thesis.  So, let&#8217;s say that most people who visit this blog (or get Cryptogram, as I do) believe that it is in society&#8217;s best interests for as many people as possible to read and understand the thesis of this book.  Yet, visitors would also like to be a recipient of a (presumably signed) galley copy from one Bruce Schneier.  Combine Sur&#8217;s idea.  Let visitors to the blog suggest opinion leaders.  Through crowdsourcing, you should be able to get a very credible list.  However, once the list is finalized, you agree to <em>double</em> the number of copies someone can show (with some credibility) that the list has been biased by one or more (&#8220;dishonest minority&#8221;) persons who would simply like to have a copy for themselves (whether or not they can enhance the book&#8217;s reception).  In other words, if Sur&#8217;s list of &#8220;opinion leaders&#8221; includes a person who managed to manipulate themselves onto the list (perhaps via a shill) despite <em>not actually being</em> an opinion leader, then your book&#8217;s thesis will have been given support.  And it would be great guerilla marketing, when you think about it&#8230;</p>
<p>Just an idea.  🙂  Good luck, Bruce!</p>

				<p>Most readers here can easily afford buying the book or find it in a local library sometime after it&#8217;s out. But there are people can get neither. So I&#8217;d give the books to readers from third world countries. Should the demand exceed the offer &#8211; random draw to rescue.</p>
<p>Of course we are potentially getting here to US export embargo issues 🙁</p>
<p>PS: If my suggestion happens to be the winning one, I&#8217;ll donate my copy too and buy one from Amazon (most likely in e-book format).</p>

				<p>simple.. don&#8217;t give them away just for the sake of giving them out.. we need people to support security &#8211; there must be some form of charitable or security education cause out there.. or maybe a university that teaches info security &#8212; have the people interested in a free copy make a donation to a security foundation or educational institution.. then they&#8217;re eligible to get a copy.. or simply have people buy the book at a pre-sale cost or some amount, donate the proceeds and send the individual a slip for their tax return, hence only the charity makes something and there is no profit or loss per se..</p>

				<p>&#8220;But on a more serious note I think that giving away books to readers of this blog is a poor idea. Lots of people including myself chose to post anonymously and honestly I&#8217;m not willing to give up my anonymity just to get a free book. &#8221;</p>
<p>Why does that make giving away copies of the book to blog readers a bad idea?  I understand why it&#8217;s a bad idea for you to request a copy of the book.  But there&#8217;s no other reasonable way for me to give a physical book to someone other than through the mail, and that requires a mailing address.  It doesn&#8217;t feel right to penalize every blog reader just because some blog readers value their anonymity more than the book.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m liking @Jur&#8217;s idea. But who&#8217;s a good opinion leader that would both read it and comment on it. On one hand I&#8217;d love to give one to Senator Patty Murray, but I doubt she&#8217;d read it or write about it (good or bad.)</p>
<p>Off hand, I&#8217;d suggest: Stephen Frye, Orson Scott Card, Wil Wheaton, Daniel Henninger (WSJ&#8217;s Wonder Land), Gregg Easterbrook (Sonicboom, TMQ), Steven D. Levitt (Freakonomics), . . .</p>
<p>I think they all exhibit the useful confluence of informed curiosity and desire to write at large.</p>

&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get 10 to 20 copies that I&#8217;d like to give away to readers of this blog. I&#8217;m not sure how to do it, though.<br />
&#8230;<br />
So to start, I&#8217;ve decided to give away a free galley copy of Liars and Outliers to the person who can come up with the best way to give away free galley copies of Liars and Outliers.&#8221;</p>
<p>December 16, 2011 9:13 AM<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m much more interested in getting the book in the hands of people who have never heard of me and would otherwise never read my book.&#8221;</p>
<p>However readers of this blog cannot possibly have never heard of you: are you lying to us?</p>
<p>A devoted and grateful reader since years.</p>

				<p>Generate 20 unique token strings like JYs!7@!fWx3rL0eR</p>
<p>Then use a php preload or similar to randomly inject them as a comment that will appear to be from a reader.  The comment won&#8217;t actually be stored in your blog, and if they hit refresh, they lost their chance.  If they DO notice the token, they can articulate what it might be used for, in a REAL reader comment , like this one, and you will contact them for their mailing address.  Thanks, Bruce.</p>

				<p>How about providing a plaintext message that must be encrypted using page number &#8211; line number -word number using one of your previous books as the key?</p>
<p>The method is easy to understand, so it makes if fair for your less experienced readers.  But it still requires a bit of dedicaton and work to build the cyphertext.</p>
<p>First X users to send a correct cyphertext wins a galley copy.</p>

				<p>Have us guess how many times the word &#8220;trust&#8221; appears in the book.  (or word-fragment, in the case of &#8220;trustworthy&#8221;)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pseudorandom, but possible to make reasonable guesses with a bit of thought.</p>
<p>I think it would be a nice balance between random (&#8220;fair&#8221;) and completely subjective (&#8220;unfair&#8221;).</p>
<p>You could even mix the two, by taking the closest 100 for 20 books, and select 20 randomly from those 100. This would hopefully also solve the problem that might arise if 25 people make identical guess for the exact correct value, and you only have 20 copies.</p>

				<p>Dear Mr. Schneier,</p>
<p>I have a suggestion which I expect will appeal to your mathematical/logical side. You are probably familiar with the so-called Unexpected Hanging Paradox. Here is the Wikipedia description:</p>
<p><i> A judge tells a condemned prisoner that he will be hanged at noon on one weekday in the following week but that the execution will be a surprise to the prisoner. He will not know the day of the hanging until the executioner knocks on his cell door at noon that day.<br />
</i><i>Having reflected on his sentence, the prisoner draws the conclusion that he will escape from the hanging. His reasoning is in several parts. He begins by concluding that the &#8220;surprise hanging&#8221; can&#8217;t be on Friday, as if he hasn&#8217;t been hanged by Thursday, there is only one day left &#8211; and so it won&#8217;t be a surprise if he&#8217;s hanged on Friday. Since the judge&#8217;s sentence stipulated that the hanging would be a surprise to him, he concludes it cannot occur on Friday.<br />
</i><i>He then reasons that the surprise hanging cannot be on Thursday either, because Friday has already been eliminated and if he hasn&#8217;t been hanged by Wednesday night, the hanging must occur on Thursday, making a Thursday hanging not a surprise either. By similar reasoning he concludes that the hanging can also not occur on Wednesday, Tuesday or Monday. Joyfully he retires to his cell confident that the hanging will not occur at all.<br />
The next week, the executioner knocks on the prisoner&#8217;s door at noon on Wednesday — which, despite all the above, was an utter surprise to him. Everything the judge said came true.</p>
<p>Similarly, it would be amusing to set up your selection system for book recipients as follows: Each user would select some other user (not himself) who he thinks would be LEAST likely to receive a book. The 20 users who receive the most such nominations (the &#8220;losers&#8221;) would in fact get a book. One might object that it would be the 20 users who contributed least who would receive books, but I think that is unlikely to happen: since every person who posts on this site wants a book, people will purposely not select people who they actually think shouldn&#8217;t get books, precisely  because if everyone did so, than the people who voted for the losers will actually be less likely than the losers to receive a book. A similar situation occurred in my college Literature class: the professor announced that we would all vote on which project was the best, and whichever project won would get 50 extra credit points. It was pretty apparent to everyone which project was best, but people were reluctant to vote for them, because the voters knew that if they all voted for the best project, they themselves would have no chance of receiving the bonus points. As a result, a more mediocre project won. The strategy I outlined above works in the opposite way; voters have an incentive to select the most insightful commenters, precisely because they think that those people are the ones least likely to win and rob the voters of a shot at winning. Of course, by explaining the method, I just ruined any chance of it working, since now everyone would realize that the voting process was actually selecting the best commenters and vote for someone else&#8230;</i></p>

				<p>(500 replies already. Hope somebody we&#8217;ll be able to read mine)<br />
How to give them up depends on what goal you want to achieve:<br />
1) to be fair among you readers: let them sign for it (until the day it will be published) and then do random selection.<br />
2) to advertise: let readers send you a link to their blog/facebook/etc post, that mentions publishing of this book. And select whichever pleases you most or has most number of readers/followers.</p>

				<p>Use a clue based &#8220;snipe hunt&#8221; to find a Wonka style &#8220;golden ticket&#8221; for the book.  Many years ago they used a similar scheme once for a role playing game of a prize of a silver statue buried somewhere.  Of course in this case you&#8217;d need 20 differing locations to hide the &#8220;tickets&#8221; instead of one.</p>

				<p>If charity is the goal, you should do a money gouge auction:</p>
<p>It would work like this:<br />
Alert media outlets and the charity PR person.<br />
Open bidding on Autographed Copy Number 1,<br />
Rules read and acknowledged to bid,<br />
and name a selected [world scope?] charity as posted:<br />
Let bidding proceed.<br />
The top two bids must both pay in each separate auction,<br />
but only the top bid gets a signed book.<br />
[The Other gets an ALSO BID CERTIFICATE.]</p>
<p>You wil likely be surprised at the final value of bragging rights,<br />
if you do a PR posting of the two top bidders for charity.</p>
<p>When that auction ends, repeat the loop,<br />
until the amounts offered drop under, say $200 each, as final bid,<br />
or you run out of books.</p>
<p>You get money for your charity,<br />
provide shared publicity for charity and books and donors,<br />
you alert new demographics to your books, and leverage publicity.</p>
<p>That would leverage each book for the most good in return.</p>

				<p>How about the first 20 subscribers of your crypto-gram newsletter. Ask the owner of that mail box to reply  in &#8220;n&#8221; hours.. So you can check whether the email is a valid one or not (if not skip to the next).<br />

				<p>Pipe the output from an infinite number of monkeys bashing at keyboards through an address validator, and send the books to the first 20 valid addresses world-wide.</p>
<p>Of course, this has several relevant features &#8211; <strong>you</strong> would first assess the randomness of the algorithm and the security of its implementation, and then <strong>we</strong> would all seek to compromise the system so as to increase our individual chances of getting one of the books&#8230;</p>
<p>And the flash-monkeying would also help to draw attention to the plight of monkeys in probabilistic captivity&#8230; Schrodinger&#8217;s cat has been getting all the charitable donations&#8230;  🙂</p>

				<p>My friend Milton F. once told me there is no such thing as a free &#8230; You could auction the books. There are a lot of clever auctions. As for me, my time costs are high enough to just buy a copy when the book becomes available. Regards, to all.</p>

				<p>Randomly assign sequential numbers to every commenter.  Have some else (who doesn&#8217;t know which number was assigned to whom) select 20 numbers between 1 and N.</p>
<p>The commenters get a book.</p>
<p>If you want, I&#8217;ll select the numbers for you and you can eliminate me from the selection process.  That way the selection is fair since I select randomly AND you assign the numbers randomly, which should assure fairness.</p>
<p>I also like the charity auction aspects.  Take a few and give them to people in the community who would auction the book for improvement to their charity; one person to consider might be Johnny Long.</p>

				<p>Another one, and IIRC this one has NOT been posted yet (and Schneier has said he wants it to be about security and be useful for promoting security):</p>
<p><b>First the participants have to identify real but not well known security risks.</b><br />
It can be just about anything, from something in everyday life to something obscure or an insecure &#8220;security practice&#8221; that some company is doing. Airport security, car security, cosmetics security, whatever. The more people it affects the better, in general, but it does not necessarily have to affect the whole world.</p>
<p><b>Explain the risk.</b><br />
What can it cause? Is it something like bad car brakes or instable constructions that is dangerous by itself? Or is it something exploitable like insecure ATMs or corporate policies that can be abused? And how ca it be abused?</p>
<p><b>Suggest a fix.</b><br />
Not just a quick fix, but the most the most complete fix you can think of, including pointing out potential errors in the reasoning about security that could have caused the insecurity, and explain how to change the thinking about it. Every single detail that you can find should be included, and the insecurity should be completely gone if your suggestion is applied.</p>
<p>The best ones win. And their contributions can easily be used to promote security, and could get people interested in the book.<br />
Contributions that are relevant to the theme of the book, contributions that are interesting to average Joe, etc, could be prioritized.<br />
Note that the contributions must be <b>easy to read</b> and <b>not obvious</b>.</p>

				<p>1) Pick one randome person who commented above, get them to pick the next, etc. until you get all 20</p>
<p>2) Get everyone who wants a free copy to send you a single cent.  Get them to also enclose a guess of how many cents you will receive in total.  The 20 closest guesses to the actual number of cents received win the book.  (Keep the money or donate to charity.  (But it&#8217;s really only nearly free then.)</p>
<p>3) If you are worried about timezones then pick the first person to post from each timezone or country, state, etc.</p>

				<p>Hi Bruce &#8212; I sent you a long list of errata and questions re: your first edition of Applied Cryptography shortly after it was published (and shortly after I had finished grad school studying under Hellman and Diffie &#8212; everything still fresh in my mind at that time!).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested to read and respond to the galley of your new book if you&#8217;d find that helpful.  Maybe that is a way to distribute galley copies &#8212; to people who have provided a significant amount of feedback to your prior books?</p>

				<p>I propose that you hold a colouring contest.</p>
<p>I have taken the opportunity to have a likeness of Bruce rendered as an outline portrait, see the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Ipl9R.png" rel="nofollow ugc">http://i.imgur.com/Ipl9R.png</a></p>
<p>The top N people who do the best job colouring in Bruce (in whatever medium they choose), and possibly photoediting him into a humorous tableau, should win a copy of the new book.</p>
<p>After the contest is over, the entries could be displayed in a gallery for all to enjoy.  I feel that this gives everyone a chance to participate, not just those who are technically gifted or who are familiar with the fields of security or cryptography.</p>

				<p>Hmmm&#8230; Liars and Outliers, a galley copy, and we have to trust that there will be a selection of a selection algorithm/method?</p>
<p>Anycase, I&#8217;d advice on sending Galley copies to the Universities involved the most in &#8220;Trust&#8221; research, as I&#8217;ve found they are the people that don&#8217;t know about you, and where I see the least amount of understanding about the real world trust and security problems.</p>
<p>Yours wishing for a galley copy, but rather wanting his local universities to get them.<br />

				<p>First, let me state that I&#8217;d really like a <em>signed</em> copy of the book.</p>
<p>Second, let&#8217;s look at your dilemma. You want to give away 20 copies of your book. You do not want to do this randomly (either through social media, pick the Nth poster etcetera).</p>
<p>That means that out of a potential set of people who would like to receive your book (assuming that is one of your criteria too, you&#8217;d like to give a copy to someone actually interested in reading it) you want to apply filtering criteria.</p>
<p>As you can already see by the entries, this potential set is already large, as there will be people reading this blog not bothering to respond with an entry for whatever reason.</p>
<p>This means that out of fairness, you want to apply a filter yielding close to 20 results, yet not be biased against any individual in particular.</p>
<p>I do not think that is possible.</p>
<p>That means you have to reduce the potential interest set by other means. If it cannot be random (take all candidates, pick the one with no Bs or Ss in his or her name etc.), this means a contest of some sort.</p>
<p>There are a number of possibilities:</p>
<p>1- the contestants would have to produce something.</p>
<p>(a) the something could be the solution to a puzzle. I.e. only one correct answer, no bias in verification.<br />
(b) the something could be something like an essay.</p>
<p>1a has the potential to yield more than 20 winners. 1b has a bias, it involves work, and it puts people who do not speak a language that you understand at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>2- the contestants would have to perform a series of somethings (a la Hercules)</p>
<p>Well, the disadvantages of that one go without saying.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that your premises and criteria for distribution, if I captured those correctly, prevent a solution without bias. Even if you could come up with a puzzle that is so hard it would be solved by only 20 people already interested in the subject matter, you probably could have selected those 20 from the blog commenters already.</p>
<p>But maybe the question posed is more readily answered on the Freakonomics blog?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ronald</p>

				<p>Rather than randomly choose anyone who has commented on the blog, why not choose randomly from a subset of commenters who offered a security topic/news story on Fridays.  Since you leave it up to the community to discuss security topics during the week that you haven&#8217;t addressed after your squid blogs, I think this could be a nice way to reward those who enhance this community by bringing up topics per your request!  It might not be very easy to filter out Friday comments this way(perhaps if they include a URL?).</p>

&#8211; a random choice for the second<br />
&#8211; a &#8220;first to comment&#8221; choice for the third<br />
&#8211; a &#8220;best funny comment&#8221; choice for the fourth<br />
&#8211; &#8230;.<br />

				<p>New idea: Movie trailer style video!</p>
<p>Preferably with that classic deep voice (voice modifier software are OK), lots of action (or at least promises about lots of action :), some cool/funny/interesting excerpts from it (since we don&#8217;t have the book, make some quotes up), &#8220;can he possibly overcome the challenge of outdoing himself yet again?&#8221;, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>The best 20 videos wins. It can be decided by voting. Obviously, this can get the interest of plenty of otherwise uninterested people so that they&#8217;ll read the book.</p>

				<p>you should send the first prints to libraries (in europe also). thus a lot more of people will have access to the book (especially some that maybe are starting in the field, like me, and don&#8217;t have the means to buy all the needed books). good luck! lucian, romania</p>

				<p>How did I get here?  Who is this Bruce Schneier fellow?  Why does my email keep getting hacked?  Why isn&#8217;t &#8220;password123&#8221; a good password?</p>
<p>Book?  What book?  Okay I&#8217;ll read a book.  Where is this book?</p>

				<p>I&#8217;d like to suggest an idea.</p>
<p>Why not look for<br />
a hidden message from a<br />
neophyte cryptographer who<br />
thinks he&#8217;s clever?</p>
<p>All you need to do is gaze at it for awhile.</p>
<p>Better yet, use a simple bot to filter<br />
out superfluous text until<br />
only the message remains and will be<br />
known to all.</p>

				<p>I suggest that I start a discussion with other users about how to best give away the books, in which the first item will be to suggest starting a new list to suggest how to do it, and so on ad infinitum. Since I could go about doing this programmatically and always be the first to post, and since this is obviously the best suggestion, I would win all the books, unless you have an infinite supply.</p>

				<p>Alternatively, figure out the person who has the smallest Schneier number (like the Erdos number or the Kevin Bacon number) based on factors outside of this blog, thus negating the actual comment providing whatever suggestion. Perhaps you could use LinkedIn&#8230; oh wait, you wouldn&#8217;t have an account there since they&#8217;re password requirements are so lax. Well good luck with this one.</p>

<h2>send a galley copy to the most unlikely professional, i.e. me. As a forester now engaged in business development i deal with broad range of issues, including security.  How on earth could i be interested in IT security and cryptography? because this affects everything we do, especially noticable after a trip thru various customs agencies in new zealand and usa.</h2>

				<p>Hi,<br />
you can ask a question about an issue in the book or use a cryptographic riddle<br />
OR<br />
auction the copies and give a charitable donations.</p>

				<p>A free book would be nice, but I have a good job and I can afford the price of a book.  I look at the younger generation as our future and the most needy people who would benefit from a free book would be those cash poor computer science majors in college slaving away at their PCs learning all the new technologies.</p>

				<p>As the book is about trust you should give them away to people whom you do not trust &#8211; politicians and senior government figures mainly I would guess.</p>

				<p>Great post. Articles that have meaningful and insightful comments are more enjoyable, at least to me. It’s interesting to read what other people thought and how it relates to them or their clients, as their perspective could possibly help you in the future.</p>
