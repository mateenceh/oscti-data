		<h2 class="entry">TEMPEST Attack</h2>
		<p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/radioexp/">new paper</a> on a low-cost TEMPEST attack against PC cryptography:</p>
<blockquote><p>We demonstrate the extraction of secret decryption keys from laptop computers, by nonintrusively measuring electromagnetic emanations for a few seconds from a distance of 50 cm. The attack can be executed using cheap and readily-available equipment: a consumer-grade radio receiver or a Software Defined Radio USB dongle. The setup is compact and can operate untethered; it can be easily concealed, e.g., inside pita bread. Common laptops, and popular implementations of RSA and ElGamal encryptions, are vulnerable to this attack, including those that implement the decryption using modern exponentiation algorithms such as sliding-window, or even its side-channel resistant variant, fixed-window (<i>m</i>-ary) exponentiation.</p>
<p>We successfully extracted keys from laptops of various models running GnuPG (popular open source encryption software, implementing the OpenPGP standard), within a few seconds. The attack sends a few carefully-crafted ciphertexts, and when these are decrypted by the target computer, they trigger the occurrence of specially-structured values inside the decryption software. These special values cause observable fluctuations in the electromagnetic field surrounding the laptop, in a way that depends on the pattern of key bits (specifically, the key-bits window in the exponentiation routine). The secret key can be deduced from these fluctuations, through signal processing and cryptanalysis.</p></blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/06/radio-bug-can-steal-laptop-crypto-keys-fits-inside-pita/">Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Researchers at Tel Aviv University and Israel&#8217;s Technion research institute have developed a new palm-sized device that can wirelessly steal data from a nearby laptop based on the radio waves leaked by its processor&#8217;s power use. Their spy bug, built for less than $300, is designed to allow anyone to &#8220;listen&#8221; to the accidental radio emanations of a computer&#8217;s electronics from 19 inches away and derive the user&#8217;s secret decryption keys, enabling the attacker to read their encrypted communications. And that device, described in a paper they&#8217;re presenting at the Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems in September, is both cheaper and more compact than similar attacks from the past &#8212; so small, in fact, that the Israeli researchers demonstrated it can fit inside a piece of pita bread.</p></blockquote>

				<p>I remarked upon this in another thread when the story was first released. It seems an extremely practical attack although is somewhat stymied by the proximity required to extract the keys.</p>

				<p>Um, when the abstract gets to sending &#8220;carefully-crafted ciphertexts&#8221; to the target computer, I am left wondering exactly how does <em>that</em> happen in an unobserved way?</p>
<p>This would seem to require a highly-targeted attack and a few other conditions beside proximity.</p>

<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>From the article: &#8220;GnuPG is often invoked to decrypt externally-controlled inputs, fed into it by numerous frontends, via emails, files, chat and web pages. The list of GnuPG frontends contains dozens of such applications, each of them can be potentially used in order to make the target decrypt the chosen ciphertexts required by our attack. As a concrete example, Enigmail (a popular plugin to the Thunderbird e-mail client) automatically decrypts incoming e-mail (for notification purposes) using GnuPG. An attacker can e-mail suitably-crafted messages to the victims (using the OpenPGP and PGP/MIME protocols), wait until they reach the target computer, and observe the target&#8217;s EM emanations during their decryption&#8221;</p>
<p>Looks like some basic knowledge of what&#8217;s running on the system is required, although you&#8217;d probably have that requisite information anyway if you were to execute this targeted attack.</p>

<p>Hmm. This was my thought at first, but after some though I wonder if this isn&#8217;t all that hard to do.</p>
<p>One could imagine a state actor who has full view of the network could simply watch and wait for ciphertexts that match their needs (e.g. a large amount of ones). Then, through other means, they install their EM sniffing devices and just correlate what it sees on the network with what emissions the sniffer sees.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;m assuming that this attack isn&#8217;t just possible for low-bandwidth PGP, but potentially high bandwidth TLS applications where signatures are made constantly by a highly trafficked server.</p>
<p>And that being said, browsers control one-half of the channels with servers. They may have some power here to force a useful message to be signed during the TLS handshake.</p>

<p>The range can be extended <em>slightly</em> by the use of more powerful equipment but with it comes interference from other nearby devices.</p>
<p>It would have to be concealed under a desk or maybe in a wall to be effective. And even then it would need to pick up the keys at just the right time.</p>

				<p>@all<br />
These are very common problems with cryptography on any electronic devices. @Clive Robinson have spoken a lot about this problem very widely and for a very long time. EMSEC is something hard to get right and even the &#8220;EMSEC-protected&#8221; machines may use fixed methodologies which one may be able to adapt and re-issue an adapted attack vector. It is kind of a cat and mouse game in the end.</p>
<p>The best protection is active offense which is to generate tonnes of noises with lots of redundancy (multi-core processors with huge amount of redundant and dynamically changing steps) which me and @Clive Robinson have suggested for active protection systems.</p>

				<p>The Hacker News and Reddit threads seemed quite clueless. We&#8217;ve had a nice information page for a long time:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jammed.com/~jwa/tempest.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.jammed.com/~jwa/tempest.html</a></p>
<p>Might be a good side project for someone to use Wayback Machine or ask people for cached copies to produce a nice zip file (or series of them) with all the relevant information. A number of those companies still exist. One that did classified training on TEMPEST said general TEMPEST info got unclassified and they can teach whoever. They have a book for sale on it. The Swedish shielding company&#8217;s office enclosures were pretty nice. As are the descriptions of shielded PC cases people acquired in surplus.</p>
<p>Universities need to be working and publishing on this subject en masse. Especially trying to figure out what the &#8220;seismic&#8221; category is. Or pushing limits of active attacks that bounce a beam off the electronics. Also, remember that ultrasound is a more recent threat that government panicked on. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re looking into infrasound yet so get on that now to earn your black patent. 😉</p>
<p>Note: Even your water pipes are a threat. Someone needs to circulate a &#8220;Restrooms considered harmful&#8221; paper in ACM or IEEE. Mwahahahaha.</p>

<p>I once worked on a project with a real paranoid client. We worked in the basement behind double sets of steel doors with 6 digit combo locks on each. One day the client visited and freaked out when he saw two copper pipes that went to the outside A/C compressor. No air ducts, just the cooling freon pipes. The air would get so stagnant that late at night we would momentarily hold all the doors open with fans blowing just to get some fresh air inside. We were told to remove the pipes because someone might use those as signal conduits. even though the building was buried deep in a campus of high security buildings.</p>

<p>You give your cell phone to the &#8220;attendant&#8221; (the guy with the gun) before you go in. I have seen magnetometers installed to help people remember. Also, they can&#8217;t transmit from inside, although they can certainly record and photograph.</p>
<p>Oh, and turn it off. We don&#8217;t want to drive the guy with the gun nuts.</p>

<p>“This was my thought at first, but after some though I wonder if this isn&#8217;t all that hard to do. One could imagine a state actor who has full view of the network could simply watch and wait for ciphertexts that match their needs (e.g. a large amount of ones). Then, through other means, they install their EM sniffing devices and just correlate what it sees on the network with what emissions the sniffer sees… I&#8217;m assuming that this attack isn&#8217;t just possible for low-bandwidth PGP, but potentially high bandwidth TLS applications where signatures are made constantly by a highly trafficked server…”</p>
<p>That’s a good possibility.</p>
<p>@ Thoth</p>
<p>“These are very common problems with cryptography on any electronic devices. @Clive Robinson have spoken a lot about this problem very widely and for a very long time. EMSEC is something hard to get right and even the &#8220;EMSEC-protected&#8221; machines may use fixed methodologies which one may be able to adapt and re-issue an adapted attack vector.”</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Here is Clive’s idea to solve the distance problem with a device to “call home” or to “store and forward” the stolen keys to out:</p>
<p>“…the application the researchers developed for the &#8220;smart phone connected to an AM band radio audio output&#8221; could be easily modified to &#8220;do an ET&#8221; and phone home or act as a &#8220;store and forward&#8221; so that it can be called up… You could also put the sensor in a laptop power supply addaptor, and just send out the information via &#8220;Home mains networking&#8221; or short hop HF through UHF bugging device to a couple of Km wih little or no difficulty as you have an inbuilt power source and antenna&#8230;</p>
<p>“It is when all is said and done just another &#8220;end run&#8221; attack, just like putting a miniture WiFi CCTV camera in the &#8220;smoke detector&#8221; in a hotel room where it can see what the weary business traveler types in on the keyboard when downloading their email etc… [1] Think of the bits inside of a &#8220;Mobile Broadband Dongle&#8221;(MBD), it would not take any kind of genius to &#8220;augment&#8221; one to act as an appropriate EM detector as an extra function, likewise the Near Field Conectivity(NFC) in dongles and now being built into mobile phones as standard would be ideal as sensing heads. It is something I&#8217;ve been thinking about off and on for a few years due to some work I was asked to do for an organisation that was contracting services to a state level organisation. Oh and as the Chinese make by far the majority of the MBDs NFCs and almost certainly the IoT devices as well, we might well not be talking &#8220;in the future tense&#8221; it might well have happened already&#8230;”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/06/friday_squid_bl_483.html#c6699014" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/06/friday_squid_bl_483.html#c6699014</a></p>
<p>There are probably a lot of ways to ex-filtrate the keys via some modified cell phone, hacked router, hidden device connected to a bot net’d box and so on.</p>

<p>A lot of things can serve as a “wire” to send data down. Even the AC power outlets in your home or office could be used.</p>
<p>“Barbed wire telephone lines were local networks created in rural America at the end of the 19th century and beginning of 20th century. In some isolated farmers&#8217; communities, it was not cost effective for corporations to invest on the telephone infrastructure. Instead, the existing extent of barbed wire fences could be use to transmit electric signals and connect phones in neighboring farms.” –Wikipedia</p>

				<p>And there I was thinking that pita bread was only used for making felafel and the like &#8230; boy, was I mistaken! What happens if someone actually tries to eat it? (It is a big bigger than I was led to believe. I was picturing something the size of a hearing-aid.)</p>
<p>One counterattack is to buy up big in pita bread whenever you suspect someone&#8217;s going to scatter inedible pita around. Then feed the surplus to random beggars and sundry strangers. That way, if you were served up with a helping of eavesdropping pita, you can use your loaf and let some beggar curse you for giving him a lump of inedible electronics &#8211; though if said beggar has nous enough, he&#8217;ll sell the electronics to some random recycler and $PROFIT$ from someone else&#8217;s stupidity.</p>

				<p>You could hide all of this not in a Pita but one of those nice leather bound writing pad holders.</p>
<p>That nice &#8220;welted&#8221; edge would be a realy nice place to put the magnetic loop antenna, and reasonable sized batteries and a micro memory card put under the sprung pad holder. The fact that most such holders have a stiff internal board and padding under the leather would mean that the board could be double sided FR4 PCB with all the electronics being surface mount. You could also have. Miniture &#8220;reed switch&#8221; in the pen holder such that a small magnet in a very expensive Monte Blanc etc pen could be used to turn it off and on.</p>
<p>Whilst putting a pita in range of the laptop might be odd and prone to discovery, putting an expensive pad holder down next to or close to the laptop to take notes most certainly would not.</p>
<p>Oh and the range of magnetic antennas goes up proportional to the area of the loop, so with around ten times the area the range is going to increase by between 10^-3 and 10^-2 which is pushing it up to the meter range. Also if you have two loops one in either cover and you hold them at around ninty degrees to each other you can feed this data into a few interesting computer algorithims such that you can &#8220;notch out&#8221; even quite strong interfering signals providing you don&#8217;t hit the receivers end stops on dynamic range&#8230;</p>
<p>I could make it even more senitive using other tricks&#8230;</p>
<p>However if I was to manufacture such items how much would you think folks would be willing to pay? I recon 10,000 USD would not be unreasonable with the appropriate software. Oh and for say 5000 more I could add encryption to the data going onto the memory cards.</p>
<p>As for &#8220;copper pipes&#8221; remember they have insides as well as outsides, the inside will make a rather good 12Ghz and up waveguide. Further if you have two pipes run as a parallel pair they will act rather more efficiently as a high impedence &#8220;transmission line&#8221; than an antenna. Which means that they will carry the signal way way way further for any given power as well as dificult to find with most &#8220;bug hunter&#8221; receivers, and such low power would mean a long battery life or better still a couple of thermo couples using the heat differential between the pipes and other fixings&#8230;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s actually a clever brainstorm. I hadn&#8217;t thought about it and don&#8217;t know anyone else posting on it. The countermeasures remain the same whether it was considered or not: power filters, EMSEC safes, shielded rooms, etc. Yet, it might be fun research for someone to see what one could learn at that point in the electrical system.</p>

				<p>Grandpa called. He said something to effect that HE had done things like this once upon a time.</p>
<p>Look up TEMPEST. It was a concept that went back to the early 1980s at least, and probably even before that. You&#8217;d think by now that people would have heard of this and done something about it. But apparently this is one of the many things that they don&#8217;t teach in undergraduate courses these days.</p>

				<p>@ Jake Brodsky,</p>
<blockquote><p>Look up TEMPEST. It was a concept that went back to the early 1980s at least, and probably even before that.</p></blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;re joking?</p>
<p>It goes back a lot lot further than that to the trenches of WWI. There were listening post both in and under the trenches that used early transducers and amplifiers (some used magamps).</p>
<p>There were a number of types of listening post including acoustic for finding artillery and mining operation, &#8220;phantom circuit&#8221; to pick up the signals from field telephones and early spark transmitters. If you look up &#8220;barbedwire telephony&#8221; you will find the knowledge of how to do this was well known to mid west farmers, who set up their own &#8220;party phone&#8221; system because the likes of Bell and Westinghouse did not think there was profit to be made there.</p>
<p>But the early &#8220;telegraph&#8221; systems from then were known to Bell enginers to be detected and decoded from considerable distance using quite modest equipment.</p>
<p>By WWII things had progressed to the point that the difference between the &#8220;hold and release&#8221; times in the relays of One Time Tape super encryptors could be easily stripped off.</p>
<p>Have a look at the history of the UK Diplomatic Wireless Service and the Rockex super encryptor. It took a very long time to sort out both the electrical and acoustic side channels it suffered from. The work was carried out by a Canadian Prof of Electrical Engineering and it required the personall approval of Winston Churchill.</p>

I'm a fellow and lecturer at Harvard's <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/bruce-schneier">Kennedy School</a>, a board member of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and the Chief of Security Architecture at <a href="https://inrupt.com/">Inrupt, Inc.</a> This personal website expresses the opinions of none of those organizations.</p>
