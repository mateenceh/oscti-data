		<p>It&#8217;s the Internet, which means there must be cute animal videos on this blog. But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MHUlVIJy94">this one</a> is different. Watch a mother rabbit beat up a snake to protect her children. It&#8217;s impressive the way she keeps attacking the snake until it is far away from her nest, but I worry that she doesn&#8217;t know enough to <a href="https://en.wikivet.net/Snake_Handling_and_Restraint">grab the snake by the neck</a>. Maybe there just aren&#8217;t any venomous snakes around those parts.</p>

				<p>Looks like at least three babies, two dead when the mother arrived, and one got away. This is why you need to get a sitter and not leave young children alone. Or at least move into a house or apartment with locks on the doors.</p>
<p>Also, the snake appears to be a black rat snake (if it was venomous, I would expect the mother to have shown the effects of the venom), placing the film in North America (being that one of the children appears to speak English as a first language, this makes sense).</p>

				<p>@ Anura,</p>
<blockquote><p>Also, the snake appears to be a black rat snake (if it was venomous, I would expect the mother to have shown the effects of the venom)</p></blockquote>
<p>From what my son and I were told at ZSL London Zoo, whilst all snakes have venom glands etc, the venom can be either ineffective or fairly prey specific. Even the constrictors have the venom glands, but there function has changed with time to act more like a set of extra saliva / lubrication glands to assist in swallowing prey. Even supposadly non-venomous snakes like the corn snake often used for pets have both venom glands and associated teeth. In the case of the corn snake they are very far back in the snakes mouth, and thus don&#8217;t work on anything rather than very small prey. Oh and Auz is not the place to go if you don&#8217;t like venomous snakes ar they have the largist percentage of the top deadly snakes&#8230;.</p>
<p>And I know from experience you &#8220;walk down the middle&#8221; of the track / road in rural areas of countries like Thailand etc, as the side &#8220;cesses&#8221; or drainage ditches are favorite resting places of &#8220;lazy snakes&#8221; that being &#8220;opportunists&#8221; rather than active hunters tend to have more deadly venom.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a big venomous snake person; I live in Southern California. Fun fact, a rattlesnake is capable of instantly paralyzing a human being without even biting them. I know this from experience, because as soon as I hear that rattle I am completely incapable of moving. Some of the trails I hiked haven&#8217;t been much wider than a person, and with tall grass or bushes to either side.</p>
<p>I was somewhat relieved for a minute when reading on Wikipedia that many snakes will either reduce venom or not inject venom at all for defensive strikes. This was until the next sentence which stated that rattlesnakes are an exception that increase venom for defensive strikes, which made me the opposite of relieved.</p>
<p>I have no problem with lizards, or any other snakes common to California (I love king snakes, because they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdCozo_Ub_Q" rel="nofollow ugc">eat rattlesnakes</a>).</p>

<p>Red and yellow mingle, bite feel a tingle. Red and black hug, sing a song, you lug.</p>
<p>Red and yellow cohabitate, soon you will suffocate. Red and black together, in for sunny weather.</p>

				<p>The rabbit doesn&#8217;t do too terribly, but it does look like it&#8217;s a bit late back to the nest. I&#8217;d be curious to see if the number of venomous snakes in an area changes behavior; if that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;d guess the jackrabbits and cottontails down here deal better or similarly with snakes as the one in the previous video.</p>
<p>One of the things I&#8217;m always impressed with, though, is our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LE78eJx5hg" rel="nofollow ugc">state bird and how it deals with rattlers</a>. It actually goes out to hunt varied snakes as a food source, which explains its expertise in handling them.</p>

				<p>No, it&#8217;s more likely this was captured in Plains, Georgia. They have killer rabbits in those parts. One of them was Soviet trained to kill Carter.</p>

<p>That video was awesome. Thanks for sharing it. Far as your worry, rabbits are prey by nature: experts at evasion rather than killing things. You could see how she clumsily launched her attacks and was confused on how best to do it. She picked a spot then leveraged her other innate skills of biting and kicking. She&#8217;s lucky it wasn&#8217;t poisonous.</p>
<p>All in all, an unlikely situation with an unusually entertaining and happy ending.</p>

<p>They have ultra-deadly everything over there. I&#8217;ll stick with America&#8217;s tourist joints: less death. We do have bears and lions. We have equally-powerful firearms, too. I try to ensure I have one in case I meet the other. 😉</p>
<p>@ Anura</p>
<p>&#8220;Fun fact, a rattlesnake is capable of instantly paralyzing a human being without even biting them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Funny. I do the same thing&#8230; briefly&#8230; to give them no reason to attack me while I try to find them or a clear area. Then I will frigging ninja-roll to that spot without regard for physical injury. Repeat until I&#8217;m sure the darn thing isn&#8217;t anywhere near me.</p>
<p>@ Wael</p>
<p>Holy crap! I had no idea a mantis could eat a corn snake! Given I&#8217;ve caught both, I&#8217;d have thought it would be the other way around.</p>
<p>Far as the tips, they&#8217;re nice mnemonics. I just tell people to learn what kinds of critters are in their area. For us, it&#8217;s mainly <a href="http://www.cottonmouthsnake.org/" rel="nofollow ugc">cottonmouth&#8217;s</a>, <a href="http://www.livescience.com/43641-copperhead-snake.html" rel="nofollow ugc">copperheads</a>, and occasional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattlesnake" rel="nofollow ugc">rattlesnake</a>. The rest are almost always the harmless varieties. I hear snakes terrify people across the country. Here in the South, they&#8217;re mostly pets or outdoor fun for bored, rural kids.</p>
<p>@ David</p>
<p>That&#8217;s nice. Those birds look pretty neat. Bashed his head in and &#8220;he dies a virgin.&#8221; Lol.</p>
<p>@ All</p>
<p>My favorite is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lampropeltis_getula" rel="nofollow ugc">common kingsnake</a>: harmless to people, kills snakes, and looks neat. 🙂 We caught one as a pet one time. Kept it in a fish tank but needed to keep top on. Put an entire encyclopedia set on top of it while we were gone. Came back to find an empty tank and a messy floor. One&#8230; strong&#8230; snake. Couldn&#8217;t find him anywhere in the house. Next day, neighbor ran out of the house yelling about a snake in her bathroom. We feigned suprise, offered to get it for her, searched the whole house, and turned up nothing. Never saw it again. Didn&#8217;t turn anymore into pets, either, lol.</p>
<p>Sneaky snakes&#8230;</p>

				<p>OFF TOPIC<br />
(guessing is is the &#8220;Friday&#8221; thread)</p>
<p>People here know I like exploring solutions to problems that mainstream admins or coders would be aghast about. Generally, the things they like cause most of their problems and I like to avoid problems here possible. Hence, the divergence. Sometimes it&#8217;s just perverse enjoyment, though. My most recent foray, inspired by High Level Assembler research, was to come up with a new, efficient, web application framework&#8230; using assembler language. (villainous laughter)</p>
<p>Turns out <a href="http://asm32.info/index.cgi?page=content/0_MiniMagAsm/index.txt" rel="nofollow ugc">someone</a> kind of beat me to the punch. And <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/b0a2z/a_reddit_clone_in_two_evenings_and_666_lines_of/" rel="nofollow ugc">an almost</a>. Ok, so there&#8217;s people out there actually doing this. The Reddit comments had an answer to every other suggestion, too. Except one: Verilog/VHDL. Might do a HDL web application in the future. Anyone accusing me of cheating with something like SHard Scheme or C-to-Verilog is probably innocent of slander.</p>
<p>(Pauses. Worries. Googles to see if Verilog web-app is unoriginal, too. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQRmjNZXH5g" rel="nofollow ugc">Damnit!</a> Give&#8217;s up&#8230;)</p>
<p>Still room for a <em>real</em> assembler web framework, though. The above examples are mere toys. Might do one in High Level Assembler or a meta-asm in the future. Target it to Docker and enjoy the look on people&#8217;s faces when shown how the containers are so small. Mwahahaha. Perhaps do a DomU guest on Xen that&#8217;s all assembler for Internet appliances. With ability to leave out anything you don&#8217;t need.</p>

				<p>Not much comment so far.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Maybe there just aren&#8217;t any venomous snakes around those parts.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>No, Bruce, there aren&#8217;t any venomous snakes around these parts, but I warn you, this rabbit warren runs deep, in fact so deep that it finally surfaces in China.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s a little project.  Someone kindly look at this form SF-86 that Ms. Archuleta has so kindly posted for public consumption</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/sf86.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/sf86.pdf</a></p>
<p>and compare that with a <i>real</i> form SF-86, because there seem to be a few check-boxes missing.</p>
<p>As to those missing check-boxes, Ms. Archuleta has seen fit to out us to the Chinese by deliberately and illegally relaxing security protocols that were put in place to protect such information.  And the Chinese are laughing all the way to the bank.  And we&#8217;re still covering up for the public.</p>

<p>re <b>Rescued Rabbits</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m mowing my grass with my reel mower when a baby rabbit takes off running. Predators regularly run through my lawn so I decide to catch him and release him in a bit safer place. Doing it without hurting him was a nice challenge. So, I mow the thick sides of the lawn to suddenly see rabbits flipping everywhere like they&#8217;re drunk. Apparently, I was running a rabbit haven and didn&#8217;t realize it.</p>
<p>I made sure the two I ran over were OK (not a scratch), calmed them down a bit, and put them back. Knowing it&#8217;s a nest, I thought the other one might be better off where the mother would return to. Finding baby rabbits in the woods isn&#8217;t easy lol. It was dark then so I decided to cheat by using my phone-light to spot the eyes. His were closed but I spotted him asleep in a camo&#8217;d spot. Grabbed him, lost him, grabbed him again (sighs), and brought his screaming ass back to his home.</p>
<p>Checked on them a bit later to see the two youngest were <a href="http://i.imgur.com/HKcCNGD.jpg" rel="nofollow ugc">together</a> with the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4QBUNky.jpg" rel="nofollow ugc">runner</a> a few inches away in thicker bush. That one has the security mindset haha. Links are the pics I took.</p>
<p>Note: Nobody type the words &#8216;image sharing service&#8217; into DuckDuckGo if you&#8217;re at work. Every sample pic on top was a porn layout lol. A few were good but it&#8217;s clearly a poor default for those common search terms. Unless that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re usually used for and DuckDuckGo is unusually smart&#8230; hmm&#8230;</p>
<p>@ Wael</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t seen a rabbit in over a year despite them allegedly being all over here. Bruce mentions it and I run over some within days of each other. Another synchronicity perhaps? 😉</p>

<p>Either that, or @Bruce has mastered the art of mind control. It&#8217;s the next step after large scale surveillance and monitoring, you know. At any rate,  a rabbit synchronicity is a lot better than a snake synchronicity. It was a full moon a couple of days ago, so who knows&#8230; (I am sure @Buck has no clue 😉 )</p>
<blockquote><p>Hacking Team&#8230; HACKED</p></blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of an <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/news/2004/jan-mar/pato_rsa.html" rel="nofollow ugc">HP project</a> a while back. Was called &#8220;active counter measures&#8221;, if I remember correctly. The idea was to use known or advertised 0-day vulnerabilities to deliver a benign payload to close the hole &#8212; fight fire with fire, eh?</p>

				<p>This is clearly in America somewhere based on the mixed language use and house construction.  Could be my suburban Atlanta neighborhood. We have a few Indian families living here. Nice folks.</p>
<p>I have both snakes AND rabbits living on my property. The snakes don&#8217;t get that big &#8211; at least I&#8217;ve never seen any longer than about 3ft. The rabbits get huge!  We have rattlesnakes around here too, but the density is nothing like Tx or Co.</p>
<p>Just like everywhere else, you teach your kids what to know about any dangerous creatures, since they will discover them on their own, always.</p>

<p>Ahhh yes, the lunar effect!<br />
Your linked article is not too easy to debunk, as the authors make no meaningful attempt to provide any sort of testible hypothesis&#8230; 😉</p>
<p>Firstly, they mention it, but then go on to ignore (call illusory) the possible effects of superstition on human behavior&#8230;</p>
<p>Second of all, they make the false claim that the advent of outdoor lighting has somehow negated the moon&#8217;s luminescence&#8230;</p>
<p>Thirdly, I have plenty of anecdotal experience with a certain 28-day cycle (moon-based or coincidental) that tends to affect my mood to a certain degree&#8230; I don&#8217;t need any loony PhD to tell me I&#8217;m (not) crazy! 😛</p>

				<p>@Buck,</p>
<p>Good guess, but not in this universe! It&#8217;s negative the speed of light, I would think; -300,000 Km/S</p>
<p>As light travels in one direction, dark travels at the same speed in the opposite direction. Kind of like electrons and holes in a semiconductor.</p>

<p>The question was about speed, not velocity, and speed is magnitude and always positive. That said, dark is caused by anti-photons*, which travel at the same speed as light (which is the same speed as all massless particles).</p>
<p>*Admittedly, I was stoned through most of my high school physics classes</p>

				<p>@Anura,</p>
<p>Pretty good for a stoned student. You are absolutely (pun intended) right. Speed is a scalar quantity and is the magnitude of velocity. You got me on a technicality. I&#8217;m still not sure my answer is correct (if we use velocity instead of speed) since I can&#8217;t visualize it.</p>

				<p>For a more serious answer: Imagine a water hose: when you turn off the hose, what speed does the not water move at? It doesn&#8217;t because it&#8217;s not a thing, however it appears to move at the same speed (and velocity) as the water, since the last drop of water exiting the hose moves at the same speed as the first drop of water (assume instantaneous opening and closing of the valve).</p>
<p>As for the quality of stoned learning, it&#8217;s like I learned in bowling: if you are going to drink in league games, make sure you practice while drinking. If you plan on being stoned in life*, make sure you go to school while stoned. If you are going to become a meth head demolitions expert, learn to handle explosives while high.</p>
<p>*For medical purposes only, of course, until I move to Colorado</p>

<p>Has nothing to do with Newton&#8217;s third law of motion. It maybe a nebulous question or my brain is getting tired&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have to think about it more&#8230; Or maybe @Clive Robinson or some physicist will have something more meaningful to say (short of this is a meaningless question)</p>

				<p>@ Nick P,</p>
<p>Regards &#8220;bunny haven&#8221; it they are rabbits not hares then they will have a warren close by. Hares on the other hand are surface dwellers and live in &#8220;scrapes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Either way they make nice eating, and I have a nice recipie for both a double crust rabbit pie and a more flavoursom jugged hare.</p>
<p>And Bruce probably knows where a good bunny pie or three can be found, as he used to do a bit of restaurant critiquing.</p>
<p>Oh and I&#8217;ve a couple of squirrel recipies that work with rabbit, hare and pigeon.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve not mentioned if you have rooks in your area, it&#8217;s very nearly that time to go &#8220;rooking&#8221; and make &#8220;four and twenty black bird&#8221; pie which actually used young rooks not mature blackbirds.</p>
<p>Speaking of blackbirds, I had a plesant surprise this morning. In my &#8220;wild life sancture&#8221; of a garden I have some brambles / blackberries against the back of the house (for jam making), on which very suprisingly there are blackberries that are actually ripe. One branch of which is resting up against the french windows where I eat breakfast when the sun is shining. Well I saw a blackbird pop up on the fence hop along it and onto the branch and work it&#8217;s way up to the berries. It looked at me as if to ask permission (close enough for me to see it had mites in it&#8217;s feathers). I nodded slightly, where upon the bird bent down grabbed a berry and hopped off, I presume to feed fledglings. Speaking of which hopefully, the three robins nests I have in the garage will be &#8220;fledged&#8221; fairly soon so I can get back in it to get out some tools to do a bit of cutting back (in the UK most wild native birds are legaly protected and disturbing their nests is a major no no).</p>

				<p>@ Buck, Wael,</p>
<p>There is obvious evidence of &#8220;lunacy&#8221; in the past when our control on our environment was a lot lot less than it is now.</p>
<p>Back three hundred years or so and earlier, man&#8217;s sources of light were Sun, moon and flame. Due to the problems with candles out doors man used what we call &#8220;torches&#8221; hence the word &#8220;torchlight&#8221;.</p>
<p>A torch was a stout stick or branch, which had a mixture of twigs, dried grass and similar tied with &#8220;withies&#8221; &#8211;string was to valuable&#8211; to it. They would sometimes have animal fats to make lighting them easier, however such fats were a very valuable resource and would be very attractive to rats and similar, so even gun powder was used as a starter&#8230; Further torches had quite a &#8220;head of flame&#8221; and thus burnt fairly quickly as well as being increadibly dangerous ( the majority of houses were wood and thatch with mud and animal dung on hurdles for walls, and fires in which a torch might be lit were in the center of the house in a pit for centuries).</p>
<p>Thus most people went in their house and locked up at dusk and stayed there untill sunrise. It was only when moonlight was bright and clouds few that people might venture out into moonlight. It was also not a safe time to be out due to a number of factors, not the least of which most people were surfs and tiethed to a lord, thus those out at that time were obviously up to no good&#8230;</p>
<p>But people did not sleep all night, they would sleep for two or three hours wake, and do various things prior to sleeping for the last two or three hours before dawn. Children as they reached six or seven would likewise start to be awake in the midnight hours and tales to keep them safe would be told. Thus the fear of &#8220;creatures of the night&#8221; would develop a life of their own.</p>
<p>And if you have been out at night in &#8220;the countryside&#8221; where manmade lighting is not used you will find that there are a lot of creatures abroad including rodents and their like and the carnivores that prey on them, and bats and owls can be very scary to encounter even when you know what they are, because that primative monkey brain we all have is easy to scare and makes us want to run up a tree to safety.</p>
<p>Thus only fools, idiots, imbeciles and others weak of mind would be abroad in the luna light, or so people would think and say.</p>
<p>As for the weak of mind being more of a problem at full moon than other times, well it has a degree of truth, due to them &#8211;wisely&#8211; not being given candles etc, moonlight gave them light to see by that at other times they did not have.</p>
<p>Now man controls the light and thus the night, the luna light connection is almost irrelevant and thus it&#8217;s effects well down in the statistical noise these days.</p>

<p>It seems like a lot of intolerance, because I have expressed myself in a certain way.  If you don&#8217;t understand it, it&#8217;s not for you, so ignore it.  If you don&#8217;t like it, take it up with the moderator.  Otherwise, tough.  I said what I said.</p>

<blockquote><p>Fair enough, I guess&#8230; Let&#8217;s sleep on it! 😉</p></blockquote>
<p>Two ways to look at it. Suppose a laser beam is fired into space. Suppose the length of the beam is 1 meter.</p>
<p>1- The beam moves in one direction at the speed of light. Or you can view space (darkness) moving at the opposite direction at the speed of light, and the laser been is standing in place.</p>
<p>2- A 1+/- meter beam of darkness trails the the berm of laser, following it in the same direction at the speed of light</p>
<p>@Anura,</p>
<p>If we specify the direction of &#8220;speed&#8221;, we implicitly make it a vector quantity.</p>

				<p>In the news that Ms. Archuleta resigned from the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/10/politics/opm-director-resigns-katherine-archuleta/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/10/politics/opm-director-resigns-katherine-archuleta/</a></p>
<p>Regarding the breach itself, China isn&#8217;t half of it.  The Mob undoubtedly has the doxx on every FBI agent in the nation.</p>
<p>This is a side story, and not the whole story, and I won&#8217;t get into that here, but it reminds me of one time I was really angry (probably drugged against my will) and I went downtown in search of the Mob.  Finally a lady on the street told me where they were, and when I went to that place, four of them got out of a car and started to surround me in black leather jackets, all smoking cigarettes, (almost as if it were a movie.)  I just backed up a few steps, and told them, &#8220;You know, you guys just aren&#8217;t welcome in town anymore.&#8221;  The argument pretty much just degenerated at that point, more people got involved, and I was no longer involved, but by the time it was over, the score was about 4-0.  I mean, big old ruckus in the street, and the body wagon rolled.  Big old ruckus in the street, and the body wagon rolled again.  All through the night, and I had nowhere to sleep, just to try not to be where the next ruckus was.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think over would be over, but no, a couple years later some upstart associate of the Mafia sets me up with some girl in a hotel room and spikes both our coffees with roofies, but well, she wasn&#8217;t exactly up for that sort of thing, so we didn&#8217;t do it, (but we were both rofl from the roofies.)  They rounded us all up and put us all in jail anyways, except for the girl, of course, because there is an unwritten rule that girls never go to jail if the Mob can help it.</p>
<p>Now the Mob is back in town yet again, and the fight goes on.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really know how big a deal the doxx on the FBI agents are.  I suspect big, but then again what type of person are you when you join the FBI?  The Mob has probably had your number long since by the time you even apply.  Even gangs like the Crips and Bloods have their own intelligence networks, and they know quite a bit more about you than you&#8217;d think.</p>
<p>The FBI and the local cops need to grow up and start taking on what they&#8217;re dealing with.  They need to get out of their offices and circulate more in the streets so they can collect more intelligence.  When they get back to their office, they need to sweep it more aggressively for hidden eyes and ears, not to mention their clothes, bodies, and cell phones.  They shouldn&#8217;t be chatting up everything they do like it&#8217;s Grand Central Station.  Keep private talk private.  That&#8217;s all.</p>

<p>Oh, now I see! I should have picked up on it from the &#8220;holes in a semiconductor&#8221; analogy, but for some reason I was thinking more about &#8216;black holes&#8217; or &#8216;dark energy&#8217; or something like that&#8230; 😛</p>

<p>Too much knowledge [1]</p>
<p>[1] Reminds me of a test long time ago. Was a probability class. Forgot what the question was but there was some spherical symmetry to it. I changed coordinates from Cartesian to spherical and trucked along. It surprisingly got very messy &#8212; I mean the idea of leveraging spherical symmetry was to simplify the solution. The prof walked around and paused at my solution, then said &#8220;too much knowledge&#8221;. At the time I smiled and felt proud (it wasn&#8217;t a complement.). This is not the case when I say &#8220;Too much knowledge&#8221; to you 😉</p>

				<p>Interesting solution.  Will have to look into that, and find out who&#8217;s prescribing this &#8220;Dilaudid&#8221; and why.  I mean, they sell all kinds of pills, and who really knows what&#8217;s in them with all those cryptic codes?</p>

				<p>@Justin,</p>
<p>The codes are there to help identify pills (that aren&#8217;t in a marked box, for example.) Can help in emergency situations as well. A similar system is used in the U.S. <a href="https://bhs.econ.census.gov/bhs/cfs/Hazmat%20Code%20List.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">hazmat code list</a>. These are the numbers you see on tankers waiting at the light next to you.</p>

<blockquote><p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nothing to see here. Wait for the light to turn green, and move right along. None of my concern what they&#8217;re carrying.</p></blockquote>
<p>How about a nice shipment of CAS Reg# 593-74-8?</p>
<p>Also seen as &#8220;C2H6Hg&#8221; a colourless liquid, that could be easily mistaken for water or light oil at a distance. Years ago &#8211;early 80&#8217;s&#8211; I had to work with the stuff occasionaly when working with NMR equipment. You might want to lookup Karen Wetterhahn&#8217;s story from a decade and a half later and see why it made my blood run cold,</p>

				<p>@Buck, @Anura,</p>
<p>Have you gone &#8220;dark&#8221; on us?</p>
<blockquote><p><i>What&#8217;s the speed of &#8220;dark&#8221;?</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking of that, there is this interesting clip about the <a HREF="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JTvcpdfGUtQ#" rel="nofollow ugc">speed of dark</a>. The video has an unbelievable story about the Dunning–Kruger effect and its relation to lemons (8:50 onwards)!!!</p>
