				<p>The ProtonMail official release date has been pushed back to the 18th February 2016.</p>
<p>iOS and Android apps will be officially released on 18/02/2016 and their blog states that &#8220;custom domain support&#8221; will be added along with 5GB of storage &#8211; both features require a paid account.</p>
<p>Now seems like as good a time as any to move over to an encrypted email service particularly post-CISA which allows all historic emails to be disclosed (and much more). Their service is based in Switzerland.</p>

				<p>Law enforcement has no issues with mass surveillance tracking of law abiding citizens in secret without any judicial oversight. But lets turn the tables:</p>
<p>Chicago Police Hid Mics, Destroyed Dashcams To Block Audio<br />
<a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20160127/archer-heights/whats-behind-no-sound-syndrome-on-chicago-police-dashcams" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20160127/archer-heights/whats-behind-no-sound-syndrome-on-chicago-police-dashcams</a></p>
<p>We need a national, uniform code of conduct for law enforcement with progressively severe consequences for intentional tampering and subversion of official records<br />
1) First offense – verbal warning<br />
2) Second offense – formal written reprimand and unpaid suspension. Probation. Ineligible for promotion.<br />
3) Third offense – termination and automatic referral to district attorney. Police license terminated</p>
<p>Special Circumstances<br />
An additional crime of special circumstances will occur in cases involving death, serious injury or corruption of justice.  Police should fight against terrorists not become one!<br />
Logically then, citizens should be able to share these incidents of possible state sponsored terrorism modeled after the CISA law.  Are you interested in the TRUTH lawmakers?</p>

				<p>@Grey, PGP et. al.<br />
The better option is to use any mail with end-to-end security in a less obvious manner. PGP with the huge PGP message banner is a gove away sign and using a secure email providers like ProtonMail also marks you as a person of interest. The better idea is for a secure email protocol wuth end-to-end encryption like PGP but remove the vulnerability of the huge PGP message banner and also in the header of the PGP encrypted message, make it harder to know the public key recipient involved. One way is to use miniLock file encryption scheme to have multiple public key encrypted headers and recipients have to use their private key to bruteforce and find their session key encrypted block. It would still leak information on how many recipients there are for the message as each recipient have a session key block. One way to stem the leaking of possible amount of recipients is to create fix amount of session key header blocks. An example being a 5 session key header block increment so you can hide 1 to 5 recipients and if you have less than 5 recipients you can fill it with random bytes to fake other non-existent recipient.</p>
<p>The problem comes in dealing with a variety of public key length with some preferring to use 2048 bit RSA and some using 4096 bit RSA and some preferring to use different types of ECC curves with shorter key lengths. This makes it hard and bulky to create the redundant session key header blocks of an encrypted message if it were to have to handle a variety of key length and might leak even more information. One way to fix it is to fix the length of every session key header bkock to the biggest possible key sizes some one might use (i.e. 8192 RSA size but you can go up to 16kb key sizes and more) which trades off redundancy for efficiency.</p>
<p>On the matter of metadata glimped while observing the encrypted MIME email travelling between global mail servers would be unavoidable unless there is a real need to not use the traditional email format and use a specialize secure messaging format.</p>

				<p>@Thoth</p>
<p>PGP isn&#8217;t used by many people and whilst, in my opinion, it is the gold standard of email encryption it is incredibly cumbersome. Providers like ProtonMail handle the decryption &#8211; subject to the user inputting the correct password. The obvious benefit to this is that it allows you to search encrypted emails on the server; something that you can&#8217;t do with plain PGP.</p>
<p>Also these online providers offer an easy to use portal-based system for a non-ProtonMail user for them to log into and decrypt their message. The recipient is provided with the password out-of-band. Obviously there&#8217;s a degree of trust here but they do make their source code available. Any emails sent without the explicit encrypt flag for non-ProtonMail recipients will receive the message via TLS (subject to support) and you could bake in any additional protection you felt necessary.</p>
<p>The other way of achieving good security would be via a conventional email account using a combination of PGP and S/MIME. A highly sensitive message could be encoded and signed with PGP, then encoded and signed with S/MIME (triple-wrapped). Even assuming compromise of the Certificate Authority you&#8217;d still have the PGP to fall back upon. Nothing would protect you if either endpoint was compromised.</p>
<p>No solution seems to fix the omnipresent metadata &#8216;problem&#8217; although for most people this I suggest is not so much of a concern contrasted with the other option of having their private emails totally unprotected.</p>

<p>I hate to say this, but there are plenty of good police. One has to always keep in mind statistics when evaluating security issues&#8230;</p>
<p>This does not mean the US &#8211; and other national &#8211; policing agencies and justice systems are not entirely fucked up.</p>
<p>They certainly are.</p>
<p>Yes, you can point out the hyperpower of the US, and the prison statistics which put the US on the same line with the worst totalitarian nations which have ever existed&#8230;.</p>
<p>But the real problem is that the worst criminals in the world are not those of the sort likely to find themselves in prison.</p>
<p>End.</p>
<p>The entire age has to be reset.</p>
<p>@albert</p>
<p>I wrote a post in a recent thread on drone technology and the problems therein. They are worth repeating. Albeit, in numerous ways, Germany, your country, has many more problems in these regards then the US&#8230;.</p>
<p>But, to recap, briefly: drones are extremely popular for the amateur market. This is unlikely to change. The primary problem, besides with crashing them, is their battery issues. The core reason why drones are even a thing.</p>
<p>Lithium ion batteries are great, and made the sure in amateur drones possible. After all, RC is hardly new. And loud. Not backyard fun.</p>
<p>But the best of them only last thirty minutes.</p>
<p>So, hydrogen fuel cells is the next wave. And this requires more automation.</p>
<p>Which gets into GPS jamming and spoofing wars&#8230;.</p>
<p>@Grey</p>
<p>I do use protonmail, but mostly because part of my job is actually <em>to be surveilled</em>.</p>
<p>Hushmail is what I depend on for anonymity, which I really consider only a silly card to play to throw people off. Why? Because Hushmail won&#8217;t turn over their information to anyone? No, because of nyms.</p>
<p>@Comment</p>
<p>&#8230; tor&#8230;</p>
<p>It should be noted that Roger Dingledine was NSA. Some say of ex-Spook, that they are never really ex.</p>
<p>A poor cover I would say, but&#8230;</p>
<p>Dingledine is not exactly the most realistic name I could ever think of, anyway.</p>
<p>Someone else posted somewhere this week about the problem of encryption being it is all amateur and non-governmental driven.</p>
<p>Bzzzt.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>It is all NSA driven&#8230;..</p>
<p>Not that the NSA is the God people tend to think it is, lol.</p>

In fact I believe it is more of the astern Mediterranean including Israel. Not surprise the UKUSA warhawks are monitoring the progress in unstable regions.</p>
<p>Quite surprisiny, all they claimed to have used are open source software suites (Image Magick and antisky) and a whole lot of patience bruteforcing the encryption and managed to break into the encrypted feeds. With enough decrypted feeds, I believe the guys in GCHQ and NSA might already have worked out the encryption algorithms for these feeds long time ago.</p>

<p>It is just a matter of time before the US goes to war with Israel. Not that I would know, lol&#8230;  I mean from my own understanding, Israel is basically our little sister we watch after.</p>
<p>So. We struck Iraq and Afghanistan to sandwich Iran. And Isolate our &#8220;buddy&#8221; Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>🙂</p>
<p>This is probably why I actually work Israeli operations, and why I am privy to the fact WE did the Dubai Hit. Which the Mossad fucked up. But, did not hurt us. Which I know, and who else? 😉</p>
<p>We have to take over all of North Africa and &#8220;The middle east&#8221;. In quotes. Because I also mean Iran.</p>
<p>So, FYI.</p>
<p>Just to let you know the future.</p>
<p>We do not fail. 🙂 🙂</p>

				<p>@RadioStar,</p>
<p>RE: Drones:<br />
What&#8217;s interesting in the CRS drone report, is the fact that the FAA is actually doing something about the drone issue. Hobby drones are low on their priority list, and there&#8217;s the typical bureaucratic inertia to deal with&#8230;but they&#8217;re trying.<br />
While I don&#8217;t want to be hit in the face by -any- size drone, a 55-pounder (the maximum weight limit in these regulations) would definitely give you a terminal headache.</p>
<p>With hobby drones, jamming techniques will become more popular and widespread, to the point of becoming dangerous to the heavier and more deadly commercial drones.  A fatal (or just serious) drone-aircraft encounter will likely get the lead out of the FAAs efforts.</p>
<p>A simple way to increase loft time, without increasing battery capacity, is lighter-than-air assistance.  The disadvantages are obvious, but the advantage of staying aloft for hours is something to be considered.</p>
<p>. .. . .. &#8212; &#8230;.</p>

<i>The NSA has been viewing encrypted Israeli drone video. The encryption algorithm was presumably strong yet applied to video in a brain dead fashion.</i></p>
<p>Funny the article only briefly mentions that they have also been viewing video feeds from fighter jets.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s doubtful that their <b>fighter jets</b> would have had encryption applied in a brain dead fashion.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if the thought of the article is to hide the true extent of the capabilities (or back doors) used by USA. Thus the Intercept wants to provide you &#8220;information&#8221; but not really the actual full picture.</p>
<p>Ergo statements about algorithms applied in a brain dead fashion.</p>

				<p>@Thoth, @Grey</p>
<p>Protonmail from a different tack..</p>
<p>There are benefits to using services like protonmail other than as a means to ensure ones privates stay private. As intuitive as that pursuit is &#8211; and acknowledging that one could very well find oneself in a situation where absolute anonymity determines ones immediate life/liberty/fortune &#8211; and as much as this may be your particular situation (or simply your passion) &#8211; this is not the case for most people. But that doesn&#8217;t mean there isn&#8217;t still value in using protonmail.</p>
<p>Besides the benefit of enhanced privacy, by using services like protonmail (in conjunction with the many other similarly privacy-promoting technologies) the individual makes a political/social statement. The same way they make a statement simply by NOT using privacy infringing technologies. The mere use (or not) of any particular product or service promotes (or not) the ideals/finances of their providers. I realize that one doesn&#8217;t always have workable alternatives. But where one does, they should ensure they use them &#8211; even if the only benefit is the statement that use makes.</p>
<p>As an example, imagine the impact of the message that would be communicated if most people started using TOR for their day-to-day browsing and ceased all activity on Facebook. Not because they were a spy, wanted to protect trade secrets, conceal criminal activity, or participate in some illicit rendezvous. But simply to communicate to commercial/governmental interests that they value privacy.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but think that for most people in most situations, it&#8217;s better than not to promote privacy enhancing technologies by regularly using them. Even if that means they &#8220;stand out&#8221; and become a person of interest. I mean, so what? If some TLA actually does go to the trouble of looking at most people, all they&#8217;re likely to glean is what is already obvious to everyone else; that they&#8217;re idiotically wasting their time and our money.</p>
<p>The more <i>&#8220;persons of interest&#8221;</i> average folks become, and the more incrementally difficult it becomes to see what they&#8217;re saying, the more mass surveillance becomes disinteresting.</p>

				<p><b>The non existant ISIS encryption app</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what to make of this.</p>
<p>Various media organisations have mentioned that IS had a secure mobile phone message app, which I was a bit suspicious about for various reasons.</p>
<p>Well it appears others were suspicious as well, and went on the hunt for it&#8230;</p>
<p>They found not a lot except some group called &#8220;Ghost Security Group,&#8221; that claims to have relationships with Western Counterterrorism interests and the media&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/isis-alrawi-encryption-messaging-app/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.dailydot.com/politics/isis-alrawi-encryption-messaging-app/</a></p>
<p>The article makes interesting reading, and the FBI&#8217;s James Comey and other prominent in the media US persons get mentioned over their quiet suspect claims about terrorists using encryption.</p>
<p>So the question arises about Ghost Security Group, who or what are they. Currently they are looking like a fake group trying to provide faux information to be used as propaganda for various LEO / IC political interests in the US and UK.</p>

				<p>@ Clive, a month ago @<a href="https://medium.com/@thegrugq" rel="nofollow ugc">thegrugq</a> wrote an somewhat detailed analysis about the [jihadi, not simply ISIS&#8217;] “<b>Cyber Terrorists Who Can’t Cyber</b>… <i>and who can’t hack for shit</i>.” Choice cuts, but <a href="https://medium.com/@thegrugq/cyber-terrorists-can-t-cyber-144406a2d78b" rel="nofollow ugc">worth reading in full</a>:</p>
<ul>The Islamic State’s is running out of hackers after the US announced the death of the Bangladeshi Siful Haque Sujan, [who] was possibly the top ISIS hacker. [He] appears to have had technical literacy, and maybe even knew how to program, but he does not appear to have had cyber security skills. <i>It seems likely that he gained the ISIS hacker mantel by simply being a “computer guy” at the ISIS shop</i>. The most specific the Western forces could come up with for a description for his hacking responsibilities was “<i>anti-surveillance</i>,” i.e. he read privacy manuals. […] ISIS has not had much luck conducting offensive cyber attacks. The biggest hack attributed to the ISIS hacker crew — Cyber Caliphate — was the TV5monde hack, but it was actually a false flag operation by Russia. Even if it was actually ISIS affiliated hacktivists, it is no more impressive than any other hacktivist attack (i.e. low skill).</ul>

				<p>More acute insights from @<a href="https://medium.com/@thegrugq" rel="nofollow ugc">thegrugq</a> on ISIS/ terrorist field communications that manage to stay ahead of traditional, inertia-laden counter-surveillance. <b>Long story short: encryption is neither used, nor does it matter</b>.</p>
<p>First this preamble: two months ago, in the wake of the November Paris attacks, while flipping the cable channels, I came across Glenn Greenwald speaking about then-topic-of-the-day, which was <i>giving the police all sorts of powers to decrypt electronic messages of  terrorists</i>. He said something very acute, that, however, seems not to have trickled down to other mass-media (perhaps the small-audience footprint of &#8220;France 24 in English&#8221; channel was here to blame).</p>
<ul>GG said that &#8220;<i>terrorists have no need to talk on the phone to one another, because they plan their attacks face-to-face… it has become family affairs… look at the <a href="http://m.thenational.ae/world/france/from-orphans-to-terrorists-journey-of-the-kouachi-brothers" rel="nofollow ugc">Kouachi brothers</a>; the Tsarnaev Boston bombers; Abdelhamid Abaaoud and his &#8220;cowgirl&#8221; cousin in Molenbeek…</i>&#8221; [paraphrased from memory].

<p>Now, from @ <b>thegrugq</b> <a href="https://medium.com/@thegrugq/its-like-snapchat-but-for-terrorists-149c63b9b6bd" rel="nofollow ugc">about use of common chat apps by the terrorists</a>:</p>
<p>[…] <cite>Suspected terrorists in Europe, young men, are playing online video games with their friends, some of whom are also suspected terrorists. These games have chat functionality. Security forces are caught off guard as <b>no one was thinking of FIFA 15 as a terrorist communication tool</b>. The reality is, almost anything young people use today allows them to chat with each other. This is <b>less an encryption problem than an overabundance of communications options</b> available to, and used by, young people</cite>.</p>
<ul>[…] “<b>The phone tapping yielded nothing</b>,” Marc Trévidic, the chief terrorism investigator for the French judicial system, said in an interview. […] <b>No one talks on the phone anymore</b>” [<a href="http://grugq.tumblr.com/post/111370459658/lessons-in-the-art-of-war" rel="nofollow ugc">thegrugq&#8217;s own emphasis</a>]</ul>

				</p>

				<p>From:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~vijay/BLAST/Lesson_5.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~vijay/BLAST/Lesson_5.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;There are four basic types of camouflage:</p>
<p>Concealing Coloration: when an animal hides itself against a background of the same color.</p>
<p>Disruptive Coloration:</p>
<p>The stripes, spots or other patterns on some animals are used to make it hard for other animals to see the outline of their bodies.</p>
<p><b> A herd of zebras crowded together might look like one large mass to a lion rather several zebras. This makes it hard for the lion to single out a weak zebra and come up with a good plan of attack.</b> Also: The zebra&#8217;s stripes also helps it hide well in tall grass from the lions. Even though the a zebra&#8217;s stripes are black and white, whereas the color of grass is green or brown, the stripes also provide effective camouflage because lions are color blind!</p>
<p>Disguise: This is like concealing coloration except that the animals blend in with their surroundings by their shape and/or texture rather than color.</p>
<p>Mimicry: Animals that use mimicry are imposters. They mimic the characteristics of unappetizing animals. A monarch butterfly is toxic and unappetizing to birds. Viceroy butterflies safeguard themselves from birds who prey upon them by looking a lot like monarch butterflies.  &#8221;</p>
<p>Device users need to choose their own style of camo. Personally I think Zebra stripe would work well against mass surveillance. How can the predatory government, corporation or other crook zero in on a rogue zebra, when they all look alike.</p>

				<p>Zebra stripes?  You are so wrong; so very, very wrong:</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;First of all, stop using the zebra as a symbol of something that is daring, exotic or eye-catching. . . . . Secondly, be wary of misconceptions or biases you might be bringing to your work. The theory that zebra stripes offer a form of camouflage has lasted for more than a century. . . . Finally, and here’s probably the most profound insight — if you’re an innovator, it’s worth questioning all the bizarre legacy processes in your company. There’s probably a good reason why things are the way they are, even if you can’t figure it out right now. In the case of zebras, of course, these bizarre legacy processes are those stripes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<p>@Ianf: A counter example to Generation Jihadi 2.0: The Norwegian right-wing terrorist managed quite a tally on his own. And if the Americans weren&#8217;t in that train (purely out of chance), that attempted attack might have ended quite a bit different as well. I for one am quite glad that the people attracted to daesh are, so far, not too bright.</p>

				<p>I like this quote from the movie After Earth (2013):<br />
Fear is not real. The only place that fear can exist is in our thoughts of the future. It is a product of our imagination, causing us to fear things that do not at present and may not ever exist. That is near insanity Kitai. Do not misunderstand me, danger is very real, but fear is a choice. We are all telling ourselves a story and that day mine changed.</p>
<p>(or just &#8220;Danger is very real, but fear is a choice.&#8221;)</p>
<p>I read it as &#8220;The danger of terrorism is real, but attacks are not necessarily as likely or as successful as one would fear.&#8221;</p>

				<p>@ Who?,</p>
<blockquote><p>It would be nice to know what experts on this forum think about his talk.</p></blockquote>
<p>I read the article a few days ago and thought &#8220;stating the obvious&#8221;, but then I&#8217;ve been thinking about this sort of problem for a third of a century or so from one aspect or another.</p>
<p>I started out finding and exploiting attacks of the sort you find in the TAO catalogue. Only I&#8217;ve had quite a few years head start on them in some respects.</p>
<p>I Then found out where some of the kit I&#8217;d designed ended up (stealing IP) and as a result I started to think about &#8220;how do I protect me?&#8221; from such state level worms.</p>
<p>You have to consider the whole computing stack from the -X physical layers through the users/managers (8), market (9), legal (10) and up.</p>
<p>The problem with the -X physical / hardware layers is &#8220;bubbling up&#8221; issues into the higher layers. The simple fact is you can not realy trust the PC hardware from this century, thus you have a serious issue as old hardware becomes scarcer and scarcer with time.</p>
<p>Thus you have to look at other hardware sources or instrumentation and mittigation.</p>
<p>Other hardware sources are microcontroler chips upto around 2010. Many of these at around 1USD each are more powerfull than minicomputers that the likes of BSD Unix was developed on. Thus if you know how to port early Unix (the source and other info is out there) and are happy with the command line and no networking then you can make a secure four terminal unix system or something similar (striped back plan 9 might be better).</p>
<p>You also need to think about what &#8220;Bastion Hosts&#8221; and &#8220;DMZ&#8221; networks are realy all about. You also need to research how you deal with security levels using data diodes / sluices / pumps / etc.</p>
<p>But to get to grips with that you also need a reasonable degree of knowledge on TEMPEST / EmSec design philosophy and physics.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve pointed out in the recent past &#8220;air-gaps&#8221; are insufficient you realy need to think &#8220;energy-gaps&#8221; and &#8220;human data diodes&#8221; if you are looking at the higher security levels.</p>
<p>But even this is not going to stop the high end snoopers who have effectivly &#8220;backdoored hardware&#8221; in the chips, the supply chain or by black bag job.</p>
<p>The way to deal with this is by mitigation and instrumentation, which is a quite involved subject.</p>
<p>Not being funny but one of those 1980&#8217;s &#8220;fall out shelters&#8221; deep under your house is a good place to start if you want the higher levels of security. Building systems in safes with &#8220;auto zero&#8221; and other &#8220;bug-out&#8221; protection is another aspect of this along with the equivalent of SCIFs etc.</p>
<p>None of which of course helps with communications issues, which are an even bigger heap of problems.</p>
<p>But you also need to</p>

<p>Clive is mentioning early bsd or a stripped down plan9 as embedded options for non standard hardware families&#8230; I would like to point out that NetBSD specifically has done the work and runs on like 30? platforms. It may make for a good starting point or reference.</p>

				<p>Some of which like the m68k lack an MMU ofc (i think this is basically to what Clive is referring).  You can source Motorola compat chips from just about everything.  In addition to the official docs there&#8217;s been lots of r/e work on the families think 6502 68k&#8230; Some of them have even made it into the ECU&#8217;s of vehicles in the last 20 years.</p>
<p>So they are likely to be accessible, programmable, light weight, low power, industrially hardened &amp; resistant to the environment.</p>
<p>You just gotta know where to look I suppose.</p>

<p>One disappointing thing about *BSD is lack of support to newer hardware. Linux is far ahead in that respect. I still like BSD more. If I had enough time and money to retire (unlikely, since it looks I have to work until I kick the bucket[1]) I would start my own BSD based project.</p>
<p>[1] Kick the bucket: die, croak, checkout, retire, push up daisies, expire, get recycled, to take a dirt nap,  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_expressions_related_to_death" rel="nofollow ugc">&#8230;</a>. Reminds me:</p>

				<p>@wael,</p>
<p>Also: fragmentation isn&#8217;t always good the people in charge of the existing strains are qualified so if you don&#8217;t have the time for your own branch, one can still contribute.</p>
<p>Ideas, patches, optimizations, hardware, requests.</p>
<p>BSD is ripe for commercial exploitation too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny what you said about bsd v Linux, that&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve felt about Linux v Windows over the last 20 years&#8230;  that specific gap is closing though.<br />
I still don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a proper argument against bsd, the rate at which Linux is introducing code and features leave the barn door open it makes me nervous&#8230;</p>

				<p>Clive, my understanding is that ISIL uses commercial and open source applications, but it&#8217;s hardly surprising that ISIL would either rely on strong encryption or that this might actually pose a problem.</p>
<p>Should ISIL&#8217;s cyber group still be operational, it would also be unsurprising if they were to attempt to develop their own applications. This would increase their stature within ISIL, and increase the reliance of others in ISIL upon them. In other words, there are strong self-interested incentives for individuals and groups within ISIL to develop such an application.</p>
<p>Of course, there are plausible scenarios in which the incentives of such a group might weigh against such actions, or in which other forces within the organization have cut off that avenue of advancement for them. So who knows. My point is simply that in the absence of contradictory information, it would be a strong hypothesis.</p>
<p>Regarding Glenn Greenwald&#8217;s argument, he doesn&#8217;t seem to understand the double-edged nature of it. The &#8220;family nature&#8221; of the ties between operatives in certain terrorist groups or conspiracies increases the difficulty of recruiting human sources of information within those groups &#8211; which makes other forms of surveillance and intelligence even more important.</p>
<p>While they may try their best to never utilize modern communications or technologies&#8230; to the extent they succeed, their operational capabilities will be drastically curtailed, and they will be unable to adjust quickly or in a coordinated fashion to unexpected circumstances. Their plans become static, rigid, and small. But it&#8217;s not only the group itself that must practice such discipline &#8211; so too must their suppliers, those who know them, those they speak to, etc. And they will not know of their compromise until it is too late, if they ever learn of it at all.</p>
<p>(On the subject of ISIL and Syria, though, an interesting story surfaced in the last couple weeks regarding a request from Russia, communicated via the then head of the GRU in early December, to Assad, asking him to step down from his position in the near future. Although the Russian Government initially refused to comment on the story, Putin eventually denied it when asked directly. However, the story fits extremely well with Russia&#8217;s operational style, and it fits with Russia&#8217;s interests in Syria. Perhaps another episode of unexpected coordination between the US and Russia lies ahead.)</p>
<p>As to the &#8220;great debate&#8221; regarding the extent to which communications or information storage immune to government interception or decryption is a desired feature for widely available products &#8211; I think the answer continues to be highly contingent on particular facts which are not yet known. Fortunately as a policy question, it may not urgently require an answer, which allows space perhaps for policy experiments, and greater thought and research, to be given to the matter.</p>
<p>But as a matter of ethics, I would think that any individual or organization has a moral obligation under certain circumstances, if within their power, to enable the interception or decryption of particular communications or information. Surely we can all agree on that much.</p>

				<p>It seems that the DHS firewall system, the National Cybersecurity Protection System &#8211; aka EINSTEIN barely does it job.<br />
The system scans for known signature to detect attacks but fails to detect 94% of the the common software vulnerabilities&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of five client applications reviewed — Adobe Acrobat, Flash, Internet Explorer, Java and Microsoft Office — the system was able to flag, to some extent, only 6 percent of all the security bugs tested. That’s 29 out of 489 vulnerabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;“Regarding zero day exploits,” Homeland Security officials stated “there is no way to identify them until they are announced,” the report states. Once they are disclosed, DHS can mold a signature to the attack pattern and feed it into EINSTEIN.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, the system can block malicious “domain name system” servers and filter emails, but “there are other types of network traffic (e.g., web content), which are common vectors of attack not currently being analyzed for potentially malicious content,” the authors said.&#8221;</p>

				<p>@ Skeptical,</p>
<blockquote><p>But as a matter of ethics, I would think that any individual or organization has a moral obligation under certain circumstances, if within their power, to enable the interception or decryption of particular communications or information. Surely we can all agree on that much.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would be nice to think so, unfortunatly there are several flys in the ointment.</p>
<p>Firstly as you know there is no requirment for LEO&#8217;s to tell the truth to anybody but judges and certain parts of the legislature. The fact LEO&#8217;s regularly get caught out telling at best half truths to judges at worst very much purjury, must make you wonder what they would say to those with access to keys etc.</p>
<p>Secondly LEO&#8217;s always have a &#8220;no tipping off&#8221; clause, thus those asked to make moral choices hear only the information LEO&#8217;s decide to present them with. Which on current knowledge is inadiquate for a moral judgment to be made.</p>
<p>Thus I would argue that if it is known that LEOs making requests have lied then they have no ethics. In a court case the &#8220;fruits of the poison vine&#8221; doctorine would apply. Which logicaly means that the only &#8220;moral and ethical&#8221; choice is to deny them.</p>
<p>LEOs should be held to way way higher moral and ethical standards than ordinary people because of &#8220;the imbalance of arms&#8221; and the significant harms they can cause by even very minor deviations from high moral and ethical standards.</p>
<p>Unfortunately LEOs are rarely if ever held to any kind of moral or ethical standard even when it has been clearly demonstrated that they have lied to judges or presented evidence they know to be false&#8230;</p>
<p>The only ethical or moral action to take is to design systems such that you can not be put into a position where you come under any kind of duress.</p>
<p>It has been shown to be a huge myth about &#8220;going dark&#8221; and this alone should give people pause for thought (it is afterall LEOs lying and not being held accountable).</p>
<p>But &#8220;eavesdropping&#8221; or &#8220;surveillance&#8221; flys in the face of justice as does the use of &#8220;agent provocateurs&#8221; and &#8220;confidential informants&#8221;, people have certain rights that should not be easily or recklessly set aside, and those that use deception to do so should be heavily punished.</p>
<p>The citizens should be able to &#8220;trust&#8221; the Government and it&#8217;s agents and entities such that any interaction with them.should not just be legal but fair and without malice. Having uncertainty or doubt about if they can be trusted is a significant and chilling issue for all citizens.</p>
<p>I certainly have little faith in many of the UK&#8217;s agents and entities, and have found some who are without doubt malicious in their actions. I suspect that a number of this blogs readers / commenters can also say that they &#8220;have little or no trust&#8221; of their Government. In such cases I can see good reason why third party &#8220;ethics and morals&#8221; do not and should not be questioned, and therefore there should be no way that such Government entities and agencies can lay such a duty with sanctions at a third parties door.</p>

				<p><b>@Quite Funny</b></p>
<p>Can you name a Secretary of Homeland Security who claimed that <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/10/01/janet_napolitano_s_cybersecurity_strategy_don_t_use_email_.html" rel="nofollow ugc"> she did not use email ? </a> I did not find that credible at the time, after all, I know who <a href="https://cei.org/richard-windsor" rel="nofollow ugc"> Richard Windsor </a>  and even <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/10/22/hillary-clintons-email-to-chelsea-stars-in-benghazi-hearing/" rel="nofollow ugc"> Diane Reynolds </a> are.</p>
<p>We should not be surprised when a FOIA request is returned with the notation &#8220;no records responsive to your request were located&#8221; as Cheryl Mills, (Hillary Clinton&#8217;s Chief of Staff while she was Secretary of State), responded to the Committee for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) which specifically asked about aliases. Cheryl Mills had sent <i> hundreds </i> of emails to Clinton at her @clintonemail.com address and copied Clinton <i> on this very request</i>.</p>

<p>I was struck by the beginning of this piece and<br />
wondered how much of our problems with computer<br />
security revolve around the same thing. Hoping<br />
it will go away if we just ignore it long enough.</p>
<p>By that I mean trusting things far past their due<br />
date on trust, since we know they are already in<br />
a state of compromise. Why not do something? Is<br />
it because we hope it was just a false alarum or<br />
we can somehow put the evil genii back into the<br />
bottle and continue to pretend it&#8217;s not broken.</p>
<p>The story is also the essence of evolution in a<br />
capsule, survivors survive. No amount of teleological<br />
maundering or ideological absurdities will save the<br />
ones who didn&#8217;t respond correctly to the environment.</p>

				<p>@Clive, Who:</p>
<p>My personally preferred quickshot is bsd on allwinner a10/20 soc boards.</p>
<p>If you want to know how much a fresh install system talks, have a network limbo in your lab, two cheap routers (i prefer cheap openwrt patchable ones) and a cheap websmart switch with monitoring capability between them (mostly cheap tp-link crap, all together 50-100$ for a 1ge limbo route).</p>
<p>testobject<br />
|<br />
router1<br />
|<br />
switch &#8211; Network recorder on monitor port<br />
|<br />
router2<br />
|<br />
vpn<br />
|<br />
edgerouter<br />
|<br />
inet<br />
                         |</p>
<p>In such a setup only testobject initiated traffic is visible between router1 and 2 and the testobject is isolated from your local net between r2 and edgerouter by vpn.</p>
<p>Sniff your stuff, will teach you a lot about it. 🙂</p>

<blockquote><p>With hobby drones, jamming techniques will become more popular and widespread, to the point of becoming dangerous to the heavier and more deadly commercial drones. A fatal (or just serious) drone-aircraft encounter will likely get the lead out of the FAAs efforts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Could be, though the more serious drones, the military ones, have anti-jamming in them. The reason the DHS got jammed is because they obtained cheaper drones without that technology.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t know much about the ins and outs of jamming beyond that, except there are three gps systems systems which look to reliability use (Russian, chinese, and American). GPS has a very low power signal, so they probably do some trickery there to ensure that anything which is coming from the wrong direction or has a higher power signal is ruled out.</p>
<p>Amateur, or more likely, commercial jamming solutions should not take off the ground, as it is so highly illegal and trivial to track&#8230;</p>
<p>I suppose a saving grace with the hobby drones is their limited fly time, and that the more sophisticated systems auto-ban areas near airports.</p>
<p>(But as the systems are related at least to open source, they could be easily hacked.)</p>

				<p>@ tyr,</p>
<blockquote><p>Hoping<br />
it will go away if we just ignore it long enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are evolutionary reasons why people do this.</p>
<p>Take &#8220;rain&#8221; for instance, peoples behaviour to it varies and slowly changes with time. Some people will not leave the building even in mid summer unless they take an umbrella or coat. Others however will in the winter &#8220;pop out&#8221; in shirtsleeves even in heavy rain, if it looks for a moment like it&#8217;s going to let up.</p>
<p>In most places rain is more of a nuisance than a threat to life, and experience tells us in temprate climates rain is usually &#8220;short lived&#8221;. Men are way more likely to discount the issue of getting wet more than women.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same for nearly every &#8220;normal experience&#8221; in life, things change and from our perspective more often for the better than the worse. Because we tend to remember bad to good changes rather than the other way around (the &#8220;glass half full/empty&#8221; effect). It usually has to be a very major life changing event for most people to behave differently. Thus the safer we perceive our environment the less likely we are to react to rare or unknown risk, unless startled.</p>
<p>Which is the crucial point, our concious mind in most cases over rules our monkey brain that causes the &#8220;flight instinct&#8221;. Evolutionary wise it makes sense in herd animals to keep eating rather than burn a lot of scarce energy taking flight. The herd provides normality and for the majority low risk, because preditors are actually few in comparison to the numbers in the herd, and thus as a prey animal you are generaly safer in the &#8220;target rich&#8221; herd than you are on your own.</p>
<p>For most of us a fire in the place we work which effects us is a very very rare event, as are floods mud slides and other environmental effects that can harm us&#8230; Thus &#8220;waiting for it to blow over&#8221; is actually the normal / sensible response based on life experience&#8230;</p>
<p>Exceptional and mechanical events hurt us because contrary to what we experience normally they don&#8217;t improve, they just get worse till it&#8217;s &#8220;too late&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve actually seen proposals to resolve these issues where by the audible and flashing alarms are made so loud and so bright, they will make staying physicaly painfull. In one case an audible alarm being so loud it could actually damage your hearing if you got within a couple of metres of it&#8230; And guess what, in testing people still did &#8220;the herd thing&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<p>I simply put such devices on an own network (router with pfSense and 3 or more NICs) and put a Linux box with two bridged NICs between the device and the router.</p>

				<p>@ keiner,</p>
<blockquote><p>Do you see any advantages of your setup over this construction?</p></blockquote>
<p>It depends on your viewpoint, a single PC is a single point of weakness two routers, a data diode to an instrumentation PC is three devices, thus three points that have to be attacked.</p>
<p>That then brings up the &#8220;hardening&#8221; issue, which solution is going to be easier to defend against aknowledgable attacker?</p>
<p>If a &#8220;cut wire&#8221; data diode is used to the instrumentation PC then &#8220;from the unsafe zone&#8221; on the public side of the first router it is going to be very dificult if not impossible to detect and therefore enumerate. Which means that potentialy your instrumentation will be either left alone or pick up &#8220;blind attacks&#8221; against it as well as the second router behind which sits the device you want to protect.</p>

Beyond the internal distrust implied by the practice, officials said there is no clear mechanism for labeling eyewash cables or distinguishing them from legitimate records being examined by the CIA’s inspector general, turned over to Congress or declassified for historians.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is unclear to me just what might be faked. From the article, it seems like this is about either &#8220;internal memos&#8221; and &#8220;cable traffic&#8221;.</p>
<p>The article does afaik not reference any specific sources for this information, other than referencing &#8220;current and former U.S. officials&#8221;.</p>
<p>Makes me wonder if there could be fake reports about fake reports, as if there could be no accountability or trusthworthiness with filed documents at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;The simple fact is you can not really trust the PC hardware from this century, thus you have a serious issue as old hardware becomes scarcer and scarcer with time.&#8221;</p>
<p>They will be around for a long time, perhaps not in a quantity that is useful.</p>
<p>Everyone here might find these old Big Iron machines for intrest:</p>
<p>These are photos I took of the Large Scale Systems Museum (LSSM), Dave McGuire President/Curator, in New Kensington Pennsylvania on January 30th 2016.</p>
<p>See the quick walk through video: <a href="https://youtu.be/n9zCQMtYvj8" rel="nofollow ugc">https://youtu.be/n9zCQMtYvj8</a></p>
<p>Still photos of the machines inside and out:</p>

<p>The IBM 370 shown in the last shot runs at less than 4 MHz and is faster than Windows 8.1 at 3 GHz.  Sad.  I don&#8217;t use Windows on my own systems&#8230;</p>
<p>The Museum is not officially open to the public yet.  It is expanding to two floors.</p>

				<p>Something I saw on twitter:</p>
<p>&#8220;Subject: Socat security advisory 7 &#8211; Created new 2048bit DH modulus&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/02/01/4" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/02/01/4</a></p>
<p>&#8220;In the OpenSSL address implementation the hard coded 1024 bit DH p<br />
  parameter was not prime.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am no expert and can&#8217;t comment on this, but I am guessing that even though p was hardcoded (bad enough?), it should perhaps had been a prime number?</p>

<p>I do not have much moral bones about that article, even if it does state that there are laws against entering disinformation in official reports. Because that is basic security, and not all laws are equal.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the issue of CIA torture, or with the looming issues of dragnet surveillance by other agencies (and state and local). I really do not think the issues compare, even if that does mean maybe State cable leaks or FOIA reports may have inaccurate information in them.</p>
<p>Perhaps, at worst.</p>
<p>Going to funerals for people who did not really die is not seriously a real problem for intelligence. How else can you reset your name or go truly undercover.</p>
<p>Interesting article, but I doubt much of what is reported there is the &#8220;real truth&#8221;. Too much is compartmentalized, too much is secret, nobody would really know. Even the highest of administrators or the oldest of workers would never know much of anything, not simply from a secrecy level, but from a level of &#8220;there is too much&#8221; for them to know.</p>
<p>Out of touch top executives is not a problem only governments face. Though, with very old and very large organizations swamped with bureaucracy, surely, it is there the most daunting sort of problem.</p>

<p>If you guys end up seeing this, what you guys are talking about a the router interception is good for wired for sure&#8230; But not so much on the topic of nation state, what I&#8217;m always paranoid about is a wireless transceiver in monitor more sending out low power packets with intentionally bad checksums.  I guess I need to put my ears real close to the device for that w Wi-Fi huh?</p>

				<p>@Keiner: If you dont use learning routing engines, only static routes, a two router setup is much &#8220;quieter&#8221; in the test zone since none of these routers knows &#8220;for sure&#8221; what all is behind the other. Try it if you have some spare hardware for a test. Less noise, less triggers, sharper signal.</p>
<p>But your setup is of cause legit, if you know how to silence potentially triggering os generated packet activity on your linux bridge and freebsd router to near 100% silent (not trivial). You could also tcpdump directly on the pfsense routing Firewall. My home and lab nets are a little too crowded, lots of broadcasting etc. and i dont like to poison tests, i want to know what a box sends without being triggered by others.</p>
<p>But maybe i am simply sometimes too anal with snr if i test new software on dial home &#8220;features&#8221;. 🙂</p>

				<p>No value here, a) I retired b) I&#8217;m no longer ahead of the curve c) because I&#8217;m mindful of being mislabeled by my government.  It&#8217;s bs the chilling effects laws have on even those responsible but what is one to do when you flirt with being labeled an international arms dealer or unlicensed vendor?</p>
<p>But I do appreciate you guys humoring me.</p>
<p>Just because they&#8217;re not after you, doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re not targets of opportunity: the question is also much bigger than just the omnipotent, there&#8217;s others. Lots and lots of others.</p>

				<p>Skeptical is trying a new angle to avoid being full of shit. This one involves floating off into empyrean levels of meaningless abstraction, then deductively proving that angels or equivalent entities dancing or otherwise capering on the heads of pinlike or less-than-blunt objects ought in principle to be potentially subject to surveillance by a benign and/or omniscient prime mover, should we grant that one exists.</p>
<p>And still the poor sod manages to stomp the blivet.</p>
<p>Skeptical ventures out into the world and immediately falls for yet another <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/lido_732.jpg" rel="nofollow ugc">interesting</a> story of the fall of Assad. Skeptical&#8217;s insider sources have informed him that Assad&#8217;s successors will be alien lizard men who David Icke identifies by wearing special maser-polarization hypergoggles. Skeptical is just so heart-warmingly gullible when his own cherished government dupes him. Then, having shown himself a total nube sucker for US government disinfo, Skep tries again to play the spy with this &#8220;family nature&#8221; nonsense. Skeptical&#8217;s clearly <a href="http://nypost.com/2009/08/16/the-cia-siberia-and-the-5m-bar-bill/" rel="nofollow ugc">dumb enough</a> to work for CIA but his fake Walter Mitty leaks are extra clueless. Nobody told him how the Safari Club works.</p>
<p>He really is the perfect dupe to fall for all that lawfare shit.</p>

				<p>@Curious<br />
In the terms of Diffie-Hellman KEX, P and G are public Prime and Generator values needed to calculate a shared secret. Hard-coding P and G is a common practice and with a large enough private key, it is safe to hard-code P and G. The problem with P not being a prime number when it is suppose to be a P (prime number value) defeats the purpose of having P. This is not a fatal mistake that will leak the private key. It will only cause irritation when trying to use DH-based KEX beause &#8230; P is not prime number &#8230;</p>
<p>They should use the standard Diffie-Hellman Groups recommended in multiple RFC standards with large enough private key size (&gt;= 2048 bits) instead of trying to generate and P or G and find out that those aren&#8217;t prime numbers. The security is not in the obscurity of public values but in the strength (key size) and secrecy of the private keys.</p>

				<p>Bruce, I wonder if you could blog on the new US-European &#8220;safe-harbor&#8221; agreement reached today.</p>
<p>A point of concern is a possible US self-interpretation of various clauses in the agreement and gaming the words e.g. spying for criminal activity, not for the limited &#8220;national security purposes&#8221; as in the following section:</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first time ever, the United States has given the EU binding assurances that the access of public authorities for national security purposes will be subject to clear limitations, safeguards and oversight mechanisms&#8221;</p>

				<p>Off topic:</p>
<p>Btw, there was an explicit reference to Edward Snowden in one of the new X-Files episodes (I think it was ep.2). The context was someone working for the government, basically stating an intent to prosecute whistleblowers forcefully, to which Mulder quips and mention Snowden&#8217;s name.</p>

				<p><b>Crypto flaw was so glaring it may be intentional eavesdropping backdoor</b><br />
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/02/crypto-flaw-was-so-glaring-it-may-be-intentional-eavesdropping-backdoor/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/02/crypto-flaw-was-so-glaring-it-may-be-intentional-eavesdropping-backdoor/</a></p>
<p><i>An open source network utility used by administrators and security professionals contains a cryptographic weakness so severe that it may have been intentionally created to give attackers a surreptitious way to eavesdrop on protected communications, its developer warned Monday.<br />
</i><i><br />
Socat is a more feature-rich variant of the once widely used Netcat networking service for fixing bugs in network applications and for finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities. One of its features allows data to be transmitted through an encrypted channel to prevent it from being intercepted by people monitoring the traffic. Amazingly, when using the Diffie-Hellman method to establish a cryptographic key, Socat used a non-prime parameter to negotiate the key, an omission that violates one of the most basic cryptographic principles.<br />
</i><i><br />
The Diffie-Hellman key exchange requires that the value be a prime number, meaning it&#8217;s only divisible by itself and the number one. Because this crucial and most basic of rules was violated, attackers could calculate the secret key used to encrypt and decrypt the protected communications.<br />
</i></p>
<p>According to article seems to have been created by someone named <b>Zhigang Wang</b> who worked at Oracle.</p>

<p>Looks like it is plausible it could have been a mistake, as opposed to an intentional vulnerability, going by the erudition of the comments. 🙂</p>
<p>To easy to argue, &#8220;anyone looking at the code should have seen this long ago&#8221;, when that was far from the case. And, if it was, then it would have been a very poor backdoor, as there are so many ways to create vulnerabilities, not a few are very hard to find. (Proof is trivial, albeit anecdotal, consider vulnerabilities ever found anywhere, and then consider that <strong>any</strong> security vulnerability could have been intentional versus unintentional. Extrapolate back from that.)</p>
<p>There are security vulnerabilities plenty no one ever considered was intentional. In fact, very very rare when they do.</p>
<p>One poster noted the app likely wasn&#8217;t used for anything interesting, just for debugging. Probably the one which stood out to me.</p>
<p>Of course, they could be a disinfo artist or simply ignorant.</p>
<p>Very unlikely on the former, certainly possible on the later.</p>

This was not a &#8220;security vulnerability&#8221; although sure you can always claim it was.</p>
<p>This was a case of their stupid software simply not working as it should have been.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s BS to claim that this is the sort of issue that&#8217;s &#8220;easy to miss&#8221;.</p>

<p>You did not understand my statements and are responding with undue emotion. <em>shrug</em></p>
<p>A backdoor is a security vulnerability. Not all security vulnerabilities are backdoors. The singular difference is if a security vulnerability is intentional or unintentional.</p>
<p>Any security vulnerability could be intentional or unintentional.</p>
<p>Mind bending, but true.</p>
<p>People generally assume security vulnerabilities are unintentional.</p>
<p>That is an assumption.</p>
<p>This particular security vulnerability appears to be intentional, and so a backdoor. From the article comments &#8211; I do not know, I have never programmed that manner of encryption in before nor utilized those classes &#8211; it appears likely that it is not a backdoor but a mistake. It may not be. But, I do not know. Another reason I came to this conclusion was because another poster in the comments pointed out the application is just used for debugging and not for anything critical. I also do not know if that is absolutely true.</p>
<p>What is curious is you can not see that any security vulnerability could be a backdoor.</p>
<p>You believe that this one is. Why? Because there was, not so long ago, two or more intentional security vulnerabilities made in the form of weakened encryption. These were known and proven by other means. Sources confirmed they were intentional.</p>
<p>This does not mean, however, all encryption vulnerabilities are intentional. Nor does it mean that all other security vulnerabilities are not.</p>

				<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am not sure this is the right place to post, but I have noticed a steep drop in the price of Blackphone BP1 coming out of China. Other than avoiding the phones where 3G is for some reason CDMA instead of GSM; the only issues I see are 1) 4G is limited to one common bandwidth for N.A. and whatever you think of the &#8220;China&#8221; issue.</p>
<p>I am a solo entrepreneur for the last three years and my experience is that having a desktop, laptop, website and smartphone entitles me to about 90% of the information security issues big companies have.</p>
<p>As i plan to watch very little video on the phone the 4G is of limited interest to me although I would like to know the common thinking. The other worry is that Private OS 1.1 has been tinkered with directly or through hardware connections and in theory, eventually there should be a fix.</p>
<p>The Blackphone currently suits my temperament and budget; is there any reason not to go ahead?</p>
<p>Also for people like me, the best resource I have found is the ABA technology guide for solo practicing lawyers and small law firms. It is really focused on small law firms and only about 50% of what a serious sole practitioner needs, but it is better than nothing. Does the community know of a better resource?</p>
<p>Remember, be nice to newbies.</p>

re: Blackphone<br />
It has been shown time and again that PrivatOS is not really secure although a little more hardened than most Android OSes out there. You are better off running any stock Android phone or if you are paranoid, load your own Cyanogen mods onto the phone which will void the phone&#8217;s warranty.</p>
<p>Android was never designed to be secure in the first place and most security were add-ons and after-thoughts which is already bad enough and deem a compromise to security. Similarly, iPhones are also not any better (since their original design are more of a commercial insecure phone where security are added as needed). Blackberries were designed more securely from the drawing board but if you don&#8217;t mind RIM and spy agencies they share data with to read your mails and messages, then it&#8217;s all fine.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is no phones that are secure due to international pressure to ensure insecurity in commercial communication devices by world Warhwak Governments and also there are lower interest and demands in secure phones around the world.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t trust most of the recommendations and suspect that these might have been doctored by powers seen and unseen that wants to control world-wide communication lines and have a NOBUS attitude to read, collect, analyse and spoof all communication systems.</p>
<p>The first step Android can do to out-perform all mobile OSes is to use it&#8217;s huge user base and setup higher assurance practices and security designs by re-designing a security microkernel layer (probably leveraging seL4 microkernel) as the first step and re-desgining it&#8217;s programming language to something much more verifiable and suitable for high assurance applications like Haskell or Ivory with stronger application firewalls, memory protection and allocation using capability-based systems integrated into microkernel&#8217;s memory management layer.</p>
<p>There are many things that can be done to improve Android but it seems that direction is affected by so many seen and unseen forces from both commercial, individual and government influences.</p>

				<p>@the usual suspects</p>
<p>How about this snippet from history ??</p>
<p>The Okhrana, the Czarist predecessor of the GPU, is reported to have<br />
invented a filing system in which every suspect was noted on a large card<br />
in the center of which his name was surrounded by a red circle; his political<br />
friends were designated by smaller red circles and his nonpolitical acquaint-<br />
ances by green ones; brown circles indicated persons in contact with friends<br />
of the suspect but not known to him personally; cross-relationships between<br />
the suspect&#8217;s friends, political and nonpolitical, and the friends of his friends<br />
were indicated by lines between the respective circles.<em>^</em>&#8216; Obviously the limi-<br />
tations of this method are set only by the size of the filing cards, and, theo-<br />
retically, a gigantic single sheet could show the relations and cross-relation-<br />
ships of the entire population. And this is the Utopian goal of the totalitarian<br />
secret police. It has given up the traditional old police dream which the<br />
lie detector is still supposed to realize, and no longer tries to find out who<br />
is who, or who thinks what. (The lie detector is perhaps the most graphic<br />
example of the fascination that this dream apparently exerts over the<br />
mentality of all policemen; for obviously the complicated measuring equip-<br />
ment can hardly establish anything except the cold-blooded or nervous<br />
temperament of its victims. Actually, the feeble-minded reasoning under-<br />
lying the use of this mechanism can only be explained by the irrational wish<br />
that some form of mind reading were possible after all.)</p>
<p>From Hannah Arendt  &#8220;the Origins of Totalitarianism&#8221;</p>
<p>Surprisingly the whole damn book resonates with examples of<br />
things that are current news all over the planet. It looks<br />
like we are living in this book today, a condition I resent<br />
the Hel out of because I&#8217;m a Warbaby (WW2). These things were<br />
supposed to have been purged by that war and the fall of the<br />
Soviet Union, not re-invented by some asshole like Zuckerberg.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to compare Czarist Russia to modern US or other &#8216;free&#8217; nations. Russia, England, Germany, France all had extremely immoral, aggressive security services. But, of these, Russia topped the list.</p>
<p>You can absolutely see a straight line from the Okhrana to the later KGB.</p>
<p>There are severe problems in the &#8216;free&#8217; nations, and they are fragile. In the US, I am not aware of them performing assassinations, as the Okhrana did, but both do trust openly in bait operations (even though this is supposedly illegal in the US).</p>
<p>In some ways, the US system is worse. In some ways, the European and other &#8216;free&#8217; systems are worse. But, in some ways they are better.</p>
<p>Expressing contrary views, for instance. Criticism. That is a way of life. Everyone does it. It is a core part of the political system. Federal officers certainly do it. Left, right &#8212; and really? Mainstream politics is even pretty damned kooky.</p>
<p>So, yeah, that is really where it is extremely different from Czarist Russia. Everybody badmouthing the regime would be in jail, murdered, setup, harassed.</p>
<p>Leaving about ten citizens left.</p>
<p>But, freedom is small and extremely fragile, and incredibly new (considering the tiny slice of time a coupla hundred years are against the massive ruler of time of human existence).</p>
<p>Extremely unlikely to grow and mature.</p>
<p>By any natural means, anyway. 🙂</p>

<p>The interesting thing about history is that once an oppressive<br />
regime comes up with a bad idea it slowly gets implemented by<br />
those governments that should know better. Passports were used<br />
by Tsarists to keep peasants tied in place by forcing them to<br />
obtain one to travel to the next village. State forced schools<br />
were used by the Prussians to generate the needed cannon fodder<br />
to rent out as mercenaries. After a bloody civil war the US has<br />
reinstituted slavery by selling prisoners to private corporations,<br />
in some cases with an iron clad contract to keep supplying a<br />
full load of prisoners.</p>
<p>The danger is quite real. The best way to wind up in the world<br />
of Orwell is to ignore the signs or to read them as benign.<br />
Current political rhetoric would have us turning Syria into<br />
radioactive glass while demonizing any decent Moslem or<br />
migrant in preparation for fencing in the US and putting the<br />
innocents into concentration camps. thinking the US is too<br />
nice to do such things is a failure to look at a very real<br />
past. Like the German said I didn&#8217;t complain when they took<br />
my neighbors because I wasn&#8217;t one of their groups. When they<br />
came for me there was no one left to complain to. Once you<br />
allow things to occur in secret as a blanket policy the toxic<br />
nature of that policy will slowly erode everything until it<br />
becomes a rotten lacework of facade.</p>
<p>One of her other books has a charming story of a French woman<br />
who said she hoped Dreyfus was innocent so his punishment would<br />
hurt him more. I have seen people express similar sentiments on<br />
the subject of torturing prisoners who are Moslems. This kind of<br />
shit is toxic to freedom, to decency, and contaminates everything<br />
it touches.</p>
<p>One of our exercises in leadership school was to circulate a<br />
mimeographed petition which was a list of the bill of rights<br />
of the US Constitution and ask people to sign it. No one would<br />
sign it because they thought it was too controversial for them<br />
to agree to and actually advocate. This was done at a supermarket<br />
in a major US city. So how much is your freedom worth in the<br />
hands of such an informed citizenry ? Today I imagine finding<br />
someone capable of reading and understanding it would be a<br />
major undertaking.</p>
<p>Recommending Arendts work is my way of getting even with Nick P.<br />
for his endless rain of technical books and ideas.</p>

<p><cite>The Norwegian right-wing nut managed quite a tally on his own.</cite></p>
<p>Yeah, like shooting fish in a barrel, live ammo target practice using children—a very mature objective on the road to White Rechristianization of Europe (or something, don&#8217;t ask me). I&#8217;ve asked around… Breivik seems to be uniformly despised by &#8220;White Power&#8221; supremacists on account of showing their true colors, when they aim to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>[…] <cite>if the three Americans weren&#8217;t on that Brussels train, the attempted shooting attack might have ended quite a bit different as well.</cite></p>
<p>Maybe, maybe not. I&#8217;d say the threat scenario of a lone, even armed, attacker &#8220;showing off&#8221; in enclosed spaces ended definitely up on the United 93 flight on 2001-09-11. These Yanks were in the right place at the right time, no doubt about that, but others would have reacted similarly, if 2-3 seconds later than them.</p>
<p><cite>glad that the people attracted to daesh are, so far, not too bright.</cite></p>
<p>Above all, the EU terrorists to date (incl. Breivik) could but be mentally ill, whatever the verdict of the medical pros. Because there is no known logical/ philosophical construct that can explain their angst at the liberal West as a form of defense-warranting oppression of their beliefs.</p>
<p>ps. lowercase ianf or I call you <b>N</b>ames.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In a sense, that&#8217;s a reassuring sign that the ICs can not cope with the sheer (and constantly growing) number of potential online-yet-under-the-radar comms channels (endpoints and instances of), thus have to concentrate on following leads acquired by more traditional methods. In all probability even these FIFA 15-games exchanges have been captured, but, as they were &#8220;shared-context-encoded&#8221; [per thegrugq&#8217;s definition], they raised no automatic alarms by whatever robot ears eavesdropping on and triggered by known &#8220;word-semaphores.&#8221;</p>
<p>@ Jacob “<cite>Dutch police uses trained falcons to take down hobby drones that stray into forbidden zones.</cite>”</p>
<p>Falcons, even eagles. In all probability, however, these are just temporary tests of feasibility of such deployment, which will end there. Reason: birds of prey are soft, while drones with rotating blades (not to mention evasive wobbly tactics) are both hard and deadly. In the end, there can be no other defenses against explosive terrorist drones in airport approach spaces than automatic targeted high-energy beam/ laser weapons. Because, when such an attack takes place, the sole thing that one can be sure of is that it will involve an array of, not a single drone. What then, unleash a flock of [in advance in dedicated standby local aviaries held] territorial defender-eagles?</p>

				<p>@Tyr</p>
<p>The dangers are real. That is why I have studied them, and why I keep track of them.</p>
<p>Privacy concerns? I am concerned not with Joe Blow&#8217;s fucking adventures getting seen by some intel folks. I am concerned about Presidential Candidate, Mayor, Sheriff, Corporate VIP, etc fucking adventures get hunted for and used against them, sidelining the entire democratic and justice process.</p>
<p>The workforce issues: those are real problems.</p>
<p>Syria: more of a &#8220;meh&#8221;. Individuals in the US can talk, but the reality is Assad can not be replaced, because Syria is right next to Israel.</p>
<p>The State Department has more power then people think.</p>
<p>Moslems being interned: Only if Donald Trump gets elected. He won&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>Syria and &#8216;Moslems being interned&#8217;, p2: Yes, events could decide otherwise. There could be a great conflagration in the Middle East. There could be an US domestic attack by Muslim terrorists of unprecedented or 911 scale which would turn the tide completely. The outrageous response from 911 does speak to that, and actually does act as a deterrent.</p>
<p>France has a worse problem there, banning headscarves is crazy. In the US, Muslims, like many of our very many first and second generation immigrants really integrate very well into society, looking at matters historically and globally.</p>
<p>Nobody here looks twice at headscarves, or treats anyone weird even with a full blown hijab. Not collectively, anyway. Freedom of belief, while often a point of great contention, is agreeable, and well understandable.</p>
<p>The incident in California did bad, overall, and was reacted to out of scope with similar incidents from those inspired by sheer lunacy. There is a deep backlash amongst some portions of the population, and they find Trump refreshing.</p>
<p>But, they are not the millenials.</p>
<p>They are not white collared, well employed professionals.</p>
<p>They are not the monetary and power backers.</p>
<p>They are alienated and frustrated partly because of their powerlessness.</p>
<blockquote><p>One of her other books has a charming story of a French woman who said she hoped Dreyfus was innocent so his punishment would hurt him more. I have seen people express similar sentiments on the subject of torturing prisoners who are Moslems. This kind of shit is toxic to freedom, to decency, and contaminates everything it touches.</p></blockquote>
<p>Very much so.</p>
<blockquote><p>a list of the bill of rights of the US Constitution and ask people to sign it. No one would sign it because they thought it was too controversial for them to agree to and actually advocate. This was done at a supermarket in a major US city. So how much is your freedom worth in the hands of such an informed citizenry ? Today I imagine finding someone capable of reading and understanding it would be a major undertaking.?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Recommending Arendts work is my way of getting even with Nick P. for his endless rain of technical books and ideas</p></blockquote>
<p>Not Nick P, lol. I work in a very technical area of security, but don&#8217;t like to get specific, or too easy for asshole hackers to track me down and scapegoat me.</p>
<p>He also works in very different area of security then I do. Clive Robinson&#8217;s posts are more likely to hit around my area, in terms of regulars here.</p>
<p>I am familiar with the Dreyfuss affair, and these other issues you mention. I have studied the Czarist regime and abuses there, albeit usually indirectly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The World That Never Was&#8221;, great book on the crazy, terrible times of security and crazy political ideas at the end of the 19th century.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8221;, and &#8220;MI5&#8221;, good books also partly covering those topics.</p>
<p>(Just going from memory. The most fascinating books on security and freedom for &#8216;around that time&#8217; I have found in studying the first world war spy wars and twenties, especially in regards to reactions to the October Revolution.)</p>
<p>(The Dreyfuss Affair comes up, however, in a lot of books and articles on much more general issues regarding security and liberty.)</p>
<p>My devil&#8217;s advocate stance on the above topics, not withstanding &#8211; they are certainly very worthwhile to mention &#8211; there are severe outstanding and current problems in the &#8216;free&#8217; nations, and certainly many foremost in the powerhouse of them all, the US of A.</p>
<p>One is workplace issues. Which is a wide and difficult topic.</p>
<p>A major one is the over all justice system, where the incarceration rate per capita is through the roof.</p>
<p>There are significant drug abuse problems involved in that, as well, which has created deep instability &#8211; and maintains deep instability &#8211; in Mexico. Mexico who has easy sea access to both oceans and many primary, core resources.</p>
<p>Easy and powerful sea access is a major, critical attribute for the intrinsic geographic value of a nation.</p>
<p>But, the drug problem in America is epidemic. And it is far from just &#8220;illegal drugs&#8221;, it goes well into prescription drugs.</p>
<p>The ham fisted, blunt instrument, moronic &#8220;solutions&#8221; have devastated the communities even more then the drugs themselves have. Core communities.</p>
<p>And continue to do so.</p>
<p>The Democratic process is a farce, however, I do not view that as a core problem of instability.</p>
<p>The domestic intelligence issue of over reach is absolutely a core problem and danger.</p>
<p>That is exactly how to take down the freedom of a &#8216;free&#8217; nation.</p>
<p>And it is even worse that they play exactly into the hands of the very terrorists they consciously tell themselves they are fighting when they push in these directions.</p>
<p>It is not terrorism which could destroy any last vestige of freedom in these nations, but the response to it.</p>
<p>Education is another core problem. The items you cite kids are not taught in school. They are overworked with meaningless tasks, and the methodologies are deeply contrary to known best educational technology.</p>
<p>In fact, you won&#8217;t even find the items you cite well taught in colleges. People have to go out of their way to study the atrocities and tyrannies of the past.</p>
<p>One good point there: the fictional cinema media and their ever fascination with presenting future totalitarian dystopias, and the people&#8217;s continued appetite for dealing with matters in that distant, metaphoric context.</p>

				<p>Why Microsoft and Google remain on business?</p>
<p>Microsoft has:</p>
<ol>
<li>Windows 10, full of spyware.</li>
<li>Telemetry patches ported to Windows 8 and Windows 7 that periodically change their IDs to be even more intrusive against these users that care to block them.</li>
<li>A `privacy&#8217; option for `power&#8217; users (i.e., those users who pay a premium license for an `enterprise&#8217; toy operating system) that lie them and do not work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Google has:</p>
<ol>
<li>A complete tracking infrastructure.</li>
<li>Absolute despise for security and privacy (except their own).</li>
<li>A `bug&#8217; that randomly enables some tracking options that users disable on their profiles and devices (let us say synchronization of certain Google apps on Android devices, or automatic log from Chrome into the owner&#8217;s account a few days after disabling this `feature&#8217;). Unsurprisingly the bug does not work the reverse, randomly disabling tracking options.</li>
</ol>
<p>On a civilized world there is no room for corporations like Microsoft, Google, Apple or Facebook.</p>

Intel&#8217;s steady march into the military fields of chips and secure OSes by fully absorbing Wind River. It seems Intel not only wants to be a majority in terms of desktop and server CPUs but also with FPGA (Altera) and now Secure RTOS (Wind River).</p>
<p>You can imagine Intel ME and crappy Intel stuff inside a military capable FPGA :). Gonna be funny looking.</p>
