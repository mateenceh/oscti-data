		<h2 class="entry">Resilient Systems News: IBM to Buy Resilient Systems</h2>
		<p><a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49243.wss">Today</a>, IBM announced its intention to purchase my company, <a href="http:///www.resilientsystems.com">Resilient Systems</a>. (Yes, the <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2016/02/23/source-ibm-security-to-acquire-resilient-systems-for-100m/">rumors</a> <a href="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2016/02/23/ibm-acquisition-cybersecurity-firm-resilient-systems/">were</a> <a href="http://www.crn.com/news/security/300079784/report-ibm-looking-to-acquire-security-incident-response-company-resilient-systems.htm">basically</a> <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/3036812/security/report-ibm-looking-to-buy-incident-response-platform-maker-resilient-systems.html">true</a>.)</p>
<p>I think this is a great development for Resilient Systems and its incident-response platform. (I know, but that&#8217;s what analysts are <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/3027019/technology-overview-security-incident-response">calling it</a>.) IBM is an ideal partner for Resilient, and one that I have been quietly hoping would acquire it for over a year now. IBM has a unique combination of security products and services, and an existing organization that will help Resilient immeasurably. It&#8217;s a good match.</p>
<p>Last year, Resilient integrated with IBM&#8217;s SIEM &#8212; that&#8217;s Security Event and Incident Management &#8212; system, QRadar. My guess is that&#8217;s what attracted IBM to us in the first place. Resilient has the platform that makes QRadar actionable. Conversely, QRadar makes Resilient&#8217;s platform more powerful. The products are each good separately, but really good together.</p>
<p>And to IBM&#8217;s credit, it understood that its customers have all sorts of protection and detection security products &#8212; both IBM&#8217;s and others &#8212; and no single response hub to make sense of it all. This is what Resilient does extremely well, and can now do for IBM&#8217;s customers globally.</p>
<p>IBM is one of the <a href="http://www.thoughtsoncloud.com/2015/06/ibm-security-has-become-a-juggernaut/">largest enterprise security companies</a> in the world. That&#8217;s not obvious; the 6,500-person <a href="https://www-03.ibm.com/security/">IBM Security</a> organization gets lost in the 390,000-person company. It has <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/techflash/2016/02/ibm-execs-see-no-letup-for-fast-expanding-security.html">$2 billion</a> in annual sales. It has a great reputation with both customers and analysts. And while Resilient is the industry leader in its field and has a great reputation, large companies like to buy from other large companies. Resilient has repeatedly sold to large enterprise customers, but it always takes some convincing. Being part of IBM makes it a safe choice. IBM also has a sales and service force that will allow Resilient to scale quickly. The company could have done it on its own eventually, but it would have taken many years.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a sad reality in tech is that too often &#8212; once, unfortunately, in my personal experience &#8212; acquisitions don&#8217;t work out for either the acquirer or the acquiree. Deals are made in optimism, but the reality is much less rosy.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that will happen here. As an acquirer, IBM has a history of effectively integrating the teams and the technologies it acquires. It has bought something like 15 security companies in the past decade &#8212; five in the past two years alone &#8212; and has (more or less) successfully integrated all of them. It carefully selects the companies it buys, spending a lot of time making sure the integration is successful. I was stunned by the amount of work the people from IBM did over the past two months, analyzing every nook and cranny of Resilient in detail: both to verify what they were buying and to figure out how to successfully integrate it.</p>
<p>IBM is going through a lot of reorganizing right now, but security is one of its big bets. It&#8217;s the <a href="https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/47087.wss">fastest-growing vendor</a> in the industry. It hired 1,000 security people in 2015. It needs to continue to grow, and Resilient is now a part of that growth.</p>
<p>Finally, IBM is an East Coast company. This may seem like a trivial point, but Resilient Systems is very much a product of the Boston area. I didn&#8217;t want Resilient to be a far-flung satellite of a Silicon Valley company. IBM Security is also headquartered in Cambridge, just five T stops away. That&#8217;s way better than a seven-hour no-legroom bad-food transcontinental flight away.</p>
<p>Random aside: this will be the third company I will have worked for whose name is no longer an acronym for its longer, original, name.</p>
<p>When I joined Resilient Systems just over two years ago, I assumed that it would eventually be purchased by a large and diversified company. Acquisitions in the security space are <a href="http://www.investors.com/news/technology/cisco-ibm-dell-ma-brawl-whacks-symantec-palo-alto-fortinet/">hot right now</a>, and I have long believed that <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/11/the_death_of_the_sec.html">security will be subsumed</a> by more general IT services. Surveying the field, IBM was always at the top of my list. Resilient had several suitors who expressed interest in purchasing it,  as well as many investors who wanted to put money into the company. This was our best option.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still working out what I&#8217;ll be doing at IBM; these months focused more on the company than on me personally. I know they want me to be involved in all of IBM Security. The people I&#8217;ll be working with know I&#8217;ll continue to blog and write books. (They also know that my website is way more popular than <a href="http://www.securityintelligence.com">theirs</a>.) They know I&#8217;ll continue to talk about politically sensitive topics. They know they won&#8217;t be able to edit or constrain my writings and speaking. At least, they say they know it; we&#8217;ll see what actually happens. But I&#8217;m optimistic. There are other IBM people whose public writings do not represent the views of IBM &#8212; so there&#8217;s precedent.</p>
<p>All in all, this is great news for Resilient Systems and &#8212; I hope &#8212; great news for IBM. We&#8217;re still <a href="https://www.resilientsystems.com/news-and-events/incident-response-press-releases/resilient-systems-unveils-latest-innovations-incident-response-technology-2016-rsa-conference/">exhibiting</a> at the RSA Conference. I&#8217;m still serving a curated cocktail at the booth (#1727, South Hall) on Tuesday from 4:00-6:00. We&#8217;re still giving away signed copies of <a href="https://www.schneier.com/book-dg.html"><i>Data and Goliath</i></a>. I&#8217;m not sure what sort of new signage we&#8217;ll have. No one liked my idea of a large spray-painted &#8220;Under New Management&#8221; sign nailed to the side of the booth, but I&#8217;m still lobbying for that.</p>
<p>EDITED TO ADD (3/17): <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ibmsecurity">This</a> is how IBM is positioning us, at least initially.</p>

<p>As long as the check clears, you can say whatever you want, and I hope the check was big enough that you&#8217;re not worried about the next check.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Bruce. Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM. Probably the same goes for selling to IBM. 😉</p>

<p>3/3? I count 2/2: Counterpane to BT and now Resilient to IBM.</p>

				<p>IBM has been buying up Software Defined Networking pieces, too.  That&#8217;s Holy Grail stuff for them.  Not that they&#8217;d be interested in what I&#8217;m doing, but&#8230;.  Good luck with the purchase.  We all know what happens when we no longer own ourselves.  But then, &#8220;always in motion is the future.&#8221;  I suspect that this will make it much harder to approach you with though experiments regarding new algorithms and such (for a while anyway).  Congratulations!</p>

				<p>@ Bruce,</p>
<p>Have they told you about the dress code?</p>
<p>It includes a &#8220;working man&#8217;s noose&#8221; and something we Brit&#8217;s call a blazer along with black &#8220;Oxford Shoes&#8221; with &#8220;well bulled toe caps&#8221; so you need to practice &#8220;little circles&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>All jokes aside enjoy what you can of IBM they have some rather interesting bits they don&#8217;t often talk about, I guess due to the size of it (rumour has it nobody knows everything it owns and does). Oh and the patent portfolio has some real suprises in it 😉</p>

<p>Oh, but they do. It&#8217;s on their <a href="https://www.research.ibm.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">research</a> page, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=18d10b14-e2c8-4780-bace-9af1fc463cc0" rel="nofollow ugc">Alphaworks</a>, and usually in various journals. Karger, one of INFOSEC&#8217;s founders, even did a <a href="https://www.acsac.org/2012/workshops/law/pdf/Lessons.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">smartcard OS</a> and <a href="https://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/papers/B9D637F6D41FD7D78525788C00525519/$File/rc25155.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">CPU</a> for them. Truth is, though, those are unusual parts of IBM. Most things they absorb tend to die far as their original form or greatness. They just get absorbed into IBM&#8217;s other, substandard offerings for their locked-in or ultra-conservative clients in big business.</p>
<p>Note: The AlphaWorks page looks like a web designer with no talent tried to &#8220;modernize&#8221; it. It used to have all key tech &amp; apps on the left in a long list. Now, one probably has to hunt around for the stuff. (sighs)</p>

<p>I have to admit that I am intrigued by the possibility of using the Watson engine in security detection and response. No idea when, or even if, I will get to play with it.</p>

				<p>I certainly hope they don&#8217;t specify the <em>type</em> of necktie. The bow tie is far better for avoiding potential life-threatening encounters with the hopper of 1000 Card/Minute readers. The Doctor says &#8220;Bow ties are cool&#8221;. As for pin-striped shirts? No way. Plain white only. Before the switch from round to rectangular holes, I suspect sleeve garters were also required.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve work for IBM twice in my career here in Oz. Once as a midrange platform Y2K specialist, The second as a migration specialist. I must say, my memories are fond. Although not being always politically correct, my weirdest memory of my associations in dealing with IBM&#8217;ers, was when I was a Proactive Support Engineer at Sun Micro Systems and working with IBM on Sun&#8217;s largest customer here in Oz. Telstra. It was good, bad and sometimes ugly. I remember the Moffat FBI investigation quite well still. I still have the news paper articles that were printed here.</p>
<p>Lets hope, that your acquisition / etc. proceeds with a clean and comfortable entity change.</p>
<p>All the best Bruce.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed our conversation when we met last year on your trip to Oz.</p>
<p>Am now waiting in another government line, due to bullshit from another government line, and work place crap.</p>
<p>I dont suppose you have a job ?</p>

<p>The Watson angle is actually an interesting idea. Machine learning, neural networks, and expert systems have already been applied to both network monitoring and incident response with success. There just haven&#8217;t been many generic situations mostly due to vast array of configurations possible vs what training data tools use. I could see them combining Watson with other techs that sort of filter or pre-process the data into useful information that Watson could then act on using response rules from Resilient Systems.</p>

				<p>In terms of integrating with Watson, you may want to talk to some high-frequency traders. They&#8217;ve been dealing with AIs trying to outsmart AIs since the early 1990s.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve worked for IBM Global Business Solutions (Federal). It was terribly mis-managed. The company&#8217;s technology is generally robust but under-utilized internally (they often won&#8217;t even use their own products).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been a relationship manager for another large firm that was doing business for them. As mentioned up-thread, they butchered ISS (just ask one of the ISS techs from the pre-acquisition days).</p>
<p>I may also have been born in the same place that IBM was. They butchered the entire region (economically), all in a day, because they couldn&#8217;t figure out how budget management works (take a look at how things went down in 1992). That problem persists &#8211; when I was working for them, they asked us to work on sensitive projects while being 112% utilized, which is illegal (that would require working three classified projects at a time, which is a cross-contamination problem).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t dislike IBM, but hope they figure out how to do business management better.</p>
<p>I do congratulate you @Bruce on what I assume is an exciting and lucrative opportunity. I hope that you can be a positive instrument of unscrewing the broken bulbs at IBM.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what a former IBMer said on Hacker News when we were discussing the BlueBox acquisition. I pointed out IBM supposedly had an internal scheme (blue dollars?) letting other IBM groups use freely or at a discount their I.P.. They also have I.P. for about everything, including some cutting-edge stuff. The employee said most teams avoided IBM&#8217;s software and services anyway to use FOSS or other proprietary products. They thought they were inferior. Ouch.</p>

				<p>Most of Big Blues problems internally are from being<br />

				</p>

				<p>First off congratulations to Bruce for what must be a very lucrative deal.</p>
<p>Having worked for IBM on one occasion and for companies who purchase services from IBM on three occasions, however, I think this is actually a bit of a sad day.</p>
<p>IBM has some truly amazing people working for it. It has some fantastic visionaries, it has some genuinely gifted security and technology people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately these are largely drowned out by the overwhelming volumes of petty minded, sales-driven charlatans. Their managed services offerings follow a very predictable trend of being brilliant for the first six months as they deliver with the same people who won the business. This is the A+ service.</p>
<p>After this honeymoon period, the good ones move on to &#8220;win new business&#8221; and the second tier of off-shore workers take over. These tend to be at least above average but there are gaps in their knowledge and they are using a lot of the customers time to get better.</p>
<p>Around six months or so of this B- service and its time for these to move on &#8211; they have either upskilled enough to find new jobs within IBM or they have been offered good roles elsewhere.</p>
<p>This is when things go down hill. From this point on, it tends to be a race to the bottom as each new wave is slightly less skilled than the one before. All driven because an IBM Service Manager needs to keep his profits high so lower skilled workers become more and more attractive.</p>
<p>Three times I have seen this happen to large clients who signed up to 10 year contracts with IBM. On all three occasions by the end of the second year, the people delivering the service were so poorly skilled, the non-IBM client had to resort to bringing in other service providers (which is where I came in) to support and manage the IBMers.</p>
<p>It is frustrating because, as I said at the start, some of the IBM guys are so amazing at their job mere mortals aren&#8217;t worth of walking in their shadow. Its a shame that most of IBM service delivery monkeys struggle to follow checklist instructions.</p>
<p>Given the standard with which IBM offers SOCs/ERS, I cant wait to see how they live up to the promises made around this purchase. (Hopefully they will learn how to respond to malware incidents before too long&#8230;.)</p>

				<p>As has been noted above, the ISS acquisition took place at a time before IBM had really got serious about a Security business. There was no place for it to go, apart from the Services business. That meant the products themselves were somewhat ignored. It was a bizarre thing to do with the ISS business, and is regarded by everyone there as THE example of how NOT to acquire.</p>
<p>IBM Security now is a completely different ball-game. QRadar has become THE example of how TO acquire, it seems to have thrived in IBM. I think this is a very good match.</p>

				<p>I just hope that IBM doesn&#8217;t use its long standing contracts with the NSA (the NSA has been using IBM computers for its work since the beginning) as a way to say to Bruce &#8220;please dont say bad things about such an important customer&#8221; or to get Bruce to stop talking about the NSA in the way he has.</p>
<p>Then again, knowing Bruce, I doubt he would have agreed to become an IBM employee if it meant he had to stop saying the things about the NSA he has been saying.</p>
<p>I do wonder if working for IBM is still the way it is described in the excellent book &#8220;The Dream Machine: J.C.R. Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing Personal&#8221;. I particularly like the bit about Licklider being given the choice between a &#8220;THINK&#8221; sign or a portrait of Thomas J Watson Jr for his office&#8230;</p>

<p>IBM Security is in Cambridge, so I can&#8217;t imagine them moving Resilient.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Then again, knowing Bruce, I doubt he would have agreed to become an IBM employee if it meant he had to stop saying the things about the NSA he has been saying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, that was pretty much my first question.</p>

				<p>&#8220;You know, Bruce, nobody cares about security.

				<p>I doubt you&#8217;d be as sanguine about being acquired by IBM if you give any<br />
credibility to the columns on IBM written by Robert X. Cringely&#8217;s in the<br />
past few years.  (<a href="http://www.cringely.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.cringely.com/</a>)</p>
<p>Enjoy the honeymoon period while it lasts.  My experience is no acquiring<br />
company can ever resist tampering with its purchases for long.  When the<br />
corporate suits start showing up with any regularity, asking questions<br />
and poking at things, that&#8217;s the beginning of the end.  Best to get out<br />
before that happens.</p>

				<p>@Anon Y. Mouse:</p>
<p>Anecdotal, but I once worked for a wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM that they took remarkable care not to fuck up (since they knew they needed the stuff it made, they viewed it as a sort of golden goose).  After more than a decade of hands-off ownership, we did eventually get digested and become IBMers, but the transition was handled carefully and the key employees got lavish deals that kept nearly all of them happy enough to stay.</p>
<p>Resilient represents a valuable asset to IBM and I predict that they will be pretty careful not to wreck it.  I think certain parts of IBM, including their security division, are savvy enough to handle that.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Deals are made in optimism, but the reality is much less rosy. I don&#8217;t think that will happen here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you sure, Mr Schneier? Just look at what IBM did to Lotus Smartsuite. They purchased Lotus Software back in 1995 and had the best spreadsheet (Lotus1-2-3)and the best organizer (Lotus Organizer). However, IBM never really invested in further development of the SmartSuite. Some two years ago, IBM ended support of the SmartSuite, tough quite a lot of people still use it. A prime example of how to destroy an acquired company. Fortunately, the SmartSuite still works on Win 10.</p>

<p><i>Some two years ago, IBM ended support of the SmartSuite, tough quite a lot of people still use it. A prime example of how to destroy an acquired company.</i></p>
<p>In tech, nobody did acquisition worse than Sun Microsystems. The way they managed to completely and utterly destroy both the Cobalt and Netscape product lines was beyond epic, to the point that many of us SE&#8217;s started questioning not just the competence but even the mental health of (some of) our then leaders.</p>

<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m breaking any confidences in saying that the reason IBM acquired Lotus was for Lotus Notes.  (Indeed after a quick check, this is official).  There is probably a good study to be written on the saga of SmartSuite / Organizer vs Office / Outlook vs OpenOffice.</p>

				<p>Thank you for your writing on the TSA. They seems to be getting greedier. It now costs $85 to get a pre-boarding &#8216;clearance&#8217; from TSA.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could delve? Follow the money? I&#8217;ve read several times that the Bush family made money  on &#8216;no child left behind. I suspect they are making money from TSA.  Bush Jr. was in the airline catering business&#8230;maybe some connection through some of those contacts?</p>
