		<h2 class="entry">Hacking Password-Protected Computers via the USB Port</h2>
		<p>PoisonTap is an <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/11/wickedly-clever-usb-stick-installs-backdoor-locked-pcs/">impressive hacking tool</a> that can compromise computers via the USB port, even when they are password-protected. What&#8217;s interesting is the chain of vulnerabilities the tool exploits. No individual vulnerability is a problem, but together they create a big problem.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kamkar&#8217;s trick works by chaining together a long, complex series of seemingly innocuous software security oversights that only together add up to a full-blown threat. When PoisonTap &#8212; a tiny $5 Raspberry Pi microcomputer loaded with Kamkar&#8217;s code and attached to a USB adapter &#8212; is plugged into a computer&#8217;s USB drive, it starts impersonating a new ethernet connection. Even if the computer is already connected to Wifi, PoisonTap is programmed to tell the victim&#8217;s computer that any IP address accessed through that connection is actually on the computer&#8217;s local network rather than the internet, fooling the machine into prioritizing its network connection to PoisonTap over that of the Wifi network.</p>
<p>With that interception point established, the malicious USB device waits for any request from the user&#8217;s browser for new web content; if you leave your browser open when you walk away from your machine, chances are there&#8217;s at least one tab in your browser that&#8217;s still periodically loading new bits of HTTP data like ads or news updates. When PoisonTap sees that request, it spoofs a response and feeds your browser its own payload: a page that contains a collection of iframes &#8212; a technique for invisibly loading content from one website inside anotherÂ­that consist of carefully crafted versions of virtually every popular website address on the internet. (Kamkar pulled his list from <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">web-popularity ranking service Alexa</a>&#8216;s top one million sites.)</p>
<p>As it loads that long list of site addresses, PoisonTap tricks your browser into sharing any cookies it&#8217;s stored from visiting them, and writes all of that cookie data to a text file on the USB stick. Sites use cookies to check if a visitor has recently logged into the page, allowing visitors to avoid doing so repeatedly. So that list of cookies allows any hacker who walks away with the PoisonTap and its stored text file to access the user&#8217;s accounts on those sites.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s more. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/11/meet-poisontap-the-5-tool-that-ransacks-password-protected-computers/">another article</a> with more details. Also note that HTTPS is a protection.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.darkreading.com/iot/security-experts-call-for-regulation-on-iot-cybersecurity/d/d-id/1327505">Yesterday</a>, <a href="https://threatpost.com/regulation-may-be-best-answer-to-iot-insecurity/121990/">I</a> <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/16/11/16/202240/schneier-we-need-a-new-agency-for-iot-security">testified</a> <a href="https://www.onthewire.io/lawmakers-ponder-regulatory-remedy-for-iot-security/">about</a> <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/bruce-schneier-internet-of-things/">this</a> <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/16/experts_to_congress_you_must_act_on_iot_security_congress_encourage_industry_to_develop_best_practices_you_say/?mt=1479344754858">at</a> <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/3141803/security/us-lawmakers-balk-at-call-for-iot-security-regulations.html">a</a> <a href="http://www.law360.com/privacy/articles/863178/house-panel-urged-to-up-rules-for-the-internet-of-things?nl_pk=f0de6bf1-38da-4828-af43-c04aba064077">joint</a> <a href="http://.cybersecuritylaw.us/2016/11/15/opinion-bruce-schneier-understanding-the-role-of-connected-devices-in-recent-cyber-attacks/">hearing</a> of the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, and the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade &#8212; both part of the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the US House of Representatives. Here&#8217;s the <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/hearings-and-votes/hearings/understanding-role-connected-devices-recent-cyber-attacks">video</a>; my testimony starts around 1:10:10.</p>
<p>The topic was the Dyn attacks and the Internet of Things. I talked about different market failures that will affect security on the Internet of Things. One of them was this problem of emergent vulnerabilities. I worry that as we continue to connect things to the Internet, we&#8217;re going to be seeing a lot of these sorts of attacks: chains of tiny vulnerabilities that combine into a massive security risk. It&#8217;ll be hard to defend against these types of attacks. If no one product or process is to blame, no one has responsibility to fix the problem. So I gave a mostly Republican audience a pro-regulation message. They were surprisingly polite and receptive.</p>

				<p>There was another hack earlier this year quite similar to this one, but aiming at the NTLM hash and possibly brute forcing the password: <a href="https://room362.com/post/2016/snagging-creds-from-locked-machines/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://room362.com/post/2016/snagging-creds-from-locked-machines/</a></p>
<p>I wonder if this inspired PoisonTap..</p>

				<p>&#8220;They were surprisingly polite and receptive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;and won&#8217;t do anything. Fine, how you learned neolib vocabulary &#8220;market-failure&#8221;, &#8220;democratization&#8221; and stuff. Did they feed you some chocolate in the end, at least?</p>

				<p>And how many companies only patch critical/important releases vs everything because &#8220;that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really risky.&#8221; I&#8217;ve never understood why they do that!?! Just patch everything that&#8217;s available, if you&#8217;re patching a system with a few patches vs 10, what&#8217;s the point? Just patch what&#8217;s available and it&#8217;ll help your overall security and stability. I don&#8217;t think the norm is to patch it all though, everywhere seems to have drawn lines of what is going to be patched and it makes no sense. If you&#8217;re patching, patch it all.</p>

				<pre>
Surely the only risk here is the same as
having a  compromised  router  somewhere
between you and the web site?
Given that (domestic)  routers are often
old  software   with   unpatched   known
vunarabilites  which  can  be  exploited
remotely,  is not  the bigget  number of
risks going to come from that direction?
(Though  there may be  bigger risks with
this,  eg.  on  well  secured  corporate
network...  but then  again you  have to
trust  your  ISP's  employees not  to be
adding some snooping device)</pre>

				<p>@ Bruce, The Usual Suspects and Samy if you are reading this blog,</p>
<p>Whilst,</p>
<blockquote><p>PoisonTap is an impressive hacking tool that can compromise computers via the USB port&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Is true, on reading through the details in a little more depth a thought occurs,</p>
<p>If you consider,</p>
<ul><i> Even if the computer is already connected to Wifi, PoisonTap is programmed to tell the victim&#8217;s computer that any IP address accessed through that connection is actually on the computer&#8217;s local network rather than the internet, fooling the machine into prioritizing its network connection to PoisonTap over that of the Wifi network.</i></ul>
<p>And what that actually means, you get the potential to hijack any and all network traffic&#8230;</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said many times before technology is agnostic to it&#8217;s use, it&#8217;s the &#8220;directing mind&#8221; that decides the purpose the technology is put to.</p>
<p>So instead of using this device and knowledg for illicit purposes as a variation on &#8220;Evil Maid&#8221;, how about usining it to build the likes of a &#8220;Universal plugin firewall / IDS&#8221;. I suspect that it would work not just with the commercial and FOSS OS desktop systems, but laptops, netbooks, and Android pads and smart phones&#8230;</p>
<p>Which as the likes of Win10 and Android OS are considered &#8220;Telemetry Enabled&#8221; in a way you can not turn it off, might help with privacy and stopping such devices getting used as botnet zombies, that the user generaly has no way to see let alone stop.</p>

				<p>You are testifying about Dyn to a HoR Hearing Sub/Committee?</p>
<p>No wonder your posts have been going on about &#8220;only government is the solution&#8221; and &#8220;we need to regulate these devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think you know well enough that regulations on IoT aren&#8217;t solutions (let alone good ones) to the complexities that were faced by the Dyn DDoS. Regulating authority over Turing Machines is a power grab using a digital &#8220;Shock Doctrine&#8221; &#8211; in this case a DDoS attack that could have only been prevented by a more sane architecture for name resolution.</p>
<p>Disheartening to see you (Schneier) entertaining that power grab rather than explaining carefully that DDoS won&#8217;t be stopped if IoT devices are immoveably secure &#8211; that indeed DDoS was a problem before the acronym IoT existed.</p>
<p>Your testimony should be that critical internet infrastructure and standards need: A) An overview and update to make them resilient and/or impervious to 21st century security concerns B) A maintenance schedule that allows the architecture of these critical components to be updated without affecting major outages C) Funding, information support and market incentives to support our critical internet services and their dependencies so that they can be upgrades D) A series of laws that make internet hacking with disclosure a safer offense so that the powers of curious and creative people can be put to work probing our technologies.</p>
<p>Recommendations to regulate here are going to raise costs, backdoor our IoT services, and won&#8217;t solve the problem.</p>

				<blockquote><p>&#8220;I worry that as we continue to connect things to the Internet, we&#8217;re going to be seeing a lot of these sorts of attacks: chains of tiny vulnerabilities that combine into a massive security risk.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the multistakeholder working groups has produced a multi-party vulnerability coordination document for discussion.</p>
<p>The draft outlines a set of guiding principles and vulnerability coordination best practices, supported with use cases that describe various scenarios and disclosure paths. The document is geared for vulnerabilities that could affect many vendors and technologies at one time.  (Could PoisonTapâs soup of relational vulnerabilities be mitigated though such a process?)</p>
<p>Hereâs one use case:</p>
<blockquote><p>Variant 3: Missing communication between upstream and downstream vendors.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Description: Direct communication or a security disclosure could be missing between upstream vendors and downstream vendors or between vendors and users. A coordinator could facilitate receiving and distributing information back and forth to relevant parties at various stages of remediation. </p></blockquote>
<p>Potential causes as well as prevention and response guidance are provided (pages 11 to 14), including the effective utilization of coordinators, vulnerability databases, and streamlined communication channels to connect a range of upstream and downstream providers. The level of oversight for process and relationship-building would be up to each party Iâm guessing?</p>

<p>What you note is certainly a concern on cases like this one.  But I am more worried about the ports that remain open on a computer when it is shut down, and barely protected by an insecure firmware (not to say the risks of hardware being backdoored by governments in collaboration with industry)&#8212;looking at the LEDs on the ethernet port blinking while the computer is turned off is worrying.</p>

				<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Is it? Pages can auto-refresh without scripts, and if they&#8217;re unencrypted, the attacker can return a redirect to an unencrypted version of a &#8220;secure&#8221; site you&#8217;re logged into. And if they forgot to set the secure cookie flag your browser will send your cookie. So I&#8217;d suggest, for sites you care about,</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a browser profile with unencrypted traffic disabled. Blacklist <a href="http://*" rel="nofollow ugc">http://*</a> and ws://* at least (with the built-in URLBlacklist setting on Chrome or the Adblock extension on Firefox) or set an http proxy pointing to an unused localhost port and don&#8217;t set an https proxy.
</li>
<li>Use a different browser profile for each &#8220;secure&#8221; site, separate from your everyday browsing profile. That way they can&#8217;t leak credentials between each other.
</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s something really important, consider disabling CAs and manually pinning certs instead (after checking fingerprints in a &#8220;normal&#8221; browser).
</li>
<li>And still disable scripting as much as possible, of course. If non-essential sites break in this configuration, complain rather than whitelisting them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, none of these things are straightforward for the &#8220;normal&#8221; user. It would be great if sites needing security could use something like DANE to indicate their site is HTTPS-only, but apparently lots of networks blocks DNSSEC lookup.</p>

				<p>I have iframes disabled in NoScript. In fact, I have everything possible disabled in my browser. No javaScript, cookies, flash, and I have the cache size set to zero.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sad that program languages are so insecure I&#8217;m forced to surf the web like this. I&#8217;ve been infected by multiple drive-by download malware infections.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t even have to click on anything to be infected. Simply visiting Yahoo.com and having a rogue advertisement load in the side-bar is enough. The infection process happens in the blink of a eye with no user interaction. You won&#8217;t even know the infection happened.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m convinced this huge push behind internet of things is more about data mining people&#8217;s lives and selling this data for a profit. It&#8217;s double dip profit. First you sell them the product, then you sell data being sent back to Corporate HQ about how they&#8217;re using that product you just sold them.</p>

<blockquote><p>But I am more worried about the ports that remain open on a computer when it is shut down</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s certainly annoying and looks suspicious. In an enterprise setting, it&#8217;s none of my business as I am the owner of nothing. On my personal machine, I own everything, and I don&#8217;t welcome unadvertised &#8220;features&#8221;. Anything that happens on my device must happen with my consent.</p>
<p>So I stay away from devices that have a &#8220;manageability engine&#8221;. If I power my device off, I want the LAN, WiFi and everything else to be off. The alternative is to unplug the device from power and remove all cables which is a hassle. Another method it to add hardware switches that disconnect or connect selected ports such as LANs. These hardware switches must not be susceptible to &#8220;remote attacks&#8221;. When the device is on, traffic must be funneled through an external firewall / switch / router that&#8217;s exclusively under the owner&#8217;s control.</p>
<blockquote><p>not to say the risks of hardware being backdoored by governments in collaboration with industry</p></blockquote>
<p>Wrap the HW with controls that only you can manage. Assume all HW / FW / SW is backdoored either deliberately, or because some idiot developer decides to get &#8220;cutsie&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote><p>looking at the LEDs on the ethernet port blinking while the computer is turned off is worrying.</p></blockquote>
<p>Easy! Just put electric tape on the blinking LEDs! ð</p>

				<p>Can someone explain to me, who would make the new network interface up (with iproute2, ip link set dev eth0 up)?</p>
<p>Then, why would my computer issue a dhcp to a new link which has never been configured?</p>
<p>Of course, if the OS is wakes up each and every new interface appearing on the system, talks to it, and changes network  settings on the fly, then nothing is safe, but all these are assumptions.</p>
<p>For example, I at our institute this attack will certainly fail&#8230;</p>

				<p>Also, why do you guys think that there is a &#8220;chain of tiny vulnerabilities&#8221;?</p>
<p>To me, network and firewall settings MUST NEVER be changed by a software, only by an admin. If this happens, it is not a &#8220;tiny&#8221; vulnerability, but a grave issue.  I don&#8217;t know what quality control MS or Apple exercise, but for any sane linux distro, that would be a release blocker&#8230;</p>

				<p>And to everyone usgin noscript, adblocker and all that&#8230; For how long are you going to continue this masturbation?</p>
<p>First, a dev team at Mozilla, Google, etc. add a ton of new JS/CSS/HTML5 capabilities. Then another team of devs adds counter-measures. Am I the only one who thinks this is crazy?</p>
<p>Have you guys forgotten about links2 and similar software. It is still functional, for instance, I wrote last three posts in links 2.13.</p>

				<p>OK, first let me say that I did read the  description at samy.pl and, btw, the code is on github, not at that link. Still, noone here even attempted to answer my questions&#8230;</p>
<p>My answers to the previous posters follow&#8230;</p>
<p>@Wael:<br />
I said already that this exploit is not going to work on any *nix machines that are maintained by me or the IT guys that I know here (here = JILA, google for it).<br />
Also, comparing this to heartbleed is like apples to oranges. For that specific openssl bug, it is instructive to read Paul Vixie&#8217;s reply to Bruce here:  <a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Apr/158" rel="nofollow ugc">http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Apr/158</a> . Of course, oftware will have bugs, but heartbleed was way over-advertised. For example, no system running sshd was vulnerable.</p>
<p>On the contrary, you are saying that my OS is supposed to automagically configure new network interfaces. Of course, it is a security issue. But I can readily tell  you more of those.</p>
<p>Have you heard of polkit, systemd-networkd and firewalld? If you have, then  you know that all of them speak dbus (maybe for networkd it is a WIP). Who else speaks dbus? Firefox and chromium and probably many other browsers. The only barrier that protects your machine now is a properly written polkit policy. Do you feel lucky? Here, you have a material for the next blackhatc or smth&#8230;</p>

				<p>But &#8220;anonymous&#8221; is so cool because it means that I am completely untraceable ð</p>
<p>Yes, Gnome, KDE and other desktop environments, which is totally fine because that&#8217;s what dbus is for (desktop-bus). However, if there is a chance that dbus calls to system software (firewalld for firewall config or systemd-networkd for network interfaces config) can be remotely forged via a browser exploit, it is quite bad. And distros that have firewalld enabled by default (Fedora, I&#8217;m looking at you), are insane.</p>
<p>Note, that in the day I am a physicist, not a sysadmin. In fact, all my skills come from observing work of archlinux developers and talking to arch users. This should tell you that if I say that our machines are protected against this exploit, there is nothing complicated to it. Just do your homework&#8230;</p>

				<p>Well done..Poison Tap is an impressive hacking tool that can compromise computers via the USB port, even when they are password protected. What&#8217;s interesting is the chain of vulnerabilities the tool exploits. No individual vulnerability is a problem, but together they create a big problem.</p>

				</p>

				<p>From what I read about this hack, it is basically a raspberry pi zero setup as a malicious man-in-the-middle usb modem/router/ethernet device.<br />
What is interesting is how this device tricks your computer to redirect all traffic to it. I believe this is how it works, other experts here can correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>Normally when your computer connects to the internet router via wifi or ethernet cable, the OS will learn from the router, using dhcp, this route &#8220;IP_addr:0.0.0.0 Netmask:0.0.0.0  Gateway_IP_addr&#8221;. In networking, this means send traffic for network 0.0.0.0/0 which encompasses all IPv4 addresses to the gateway.</p>
<p>When the malicious usb device connects to the computer, it will falsely identify as a network  device to the OS. This causes the OS to query the device with dhcp requests and learns 2 routes from it &#8220;IP_addr:0.0.0.0 Netmask:128.0.0.0  malicious_IP_addr&#8221; and &#8220;IP_addr:128.0.0.0 Netmask:128.0.0.0  malicious_IP_addr&#8221;. In short, the malicious device is telling to send traffic for 0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.0/1  to it.</p>
<p>Notice that 0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.0/1 is 0.0.0.0/0 divided into two subnets. Since network routing protocols prefer routes with more specific subnets ie. netmasks with a larger value, all traffic is forwarded to the malicious device instead of gateway.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Samy&#8217;s explanation is inaccurate. I believe network routes learnt from dhcp to have the same priority/metric regardless of the interface. The hint I get is a graphic on Samy&#8217;s website showing poisonTap&#8217;s netmask to be 128.0.0.0. A quick google search shows OpenVPN uses the same trick to force all network traffic to the VPN tunnel.</p>
<p>I think static routes set by admin or routes learnt by other means like AD group policies can mitigate against network hijacking.</p>

				<p>@Matthew:<br />
In essence, THIS is a standard attack when a client connects to a malicious gateway. Replace USB hijacking and similar buzzwords with plugging network cable to a malicious router. Now you have a computer plugged into a gateway that you own and there is no need to discuss priorities of different subnets. Similarly, you can bring your own wifi access point and hope that clients will reconnect to it. Of course you are screwed if they use radius.</p>
<p>The implications of running unencrypted traffic through an untrusted gateway are well known. Such gateways you see in coffee shops, hotels, airports, etc. On the other hand, online banking (that everyone advises against) is safe if https is used.</p>
<p>Regarding priority, link local addresses are always higher priority that ip on different subnets. For example, if you are on a 192.168.0.0/24 subnet with a gateway at 192.168.0.1, then your traffic destined for other machines on the same subnet never hits the gateway. In this case, the local network is the entire ipv4 range.</p>
<p>Static routes will help, yes. But they need to be properly, configured in conjunction with a DHCP client. A much simpler approach is to make sure that a DHCP client listens only on a specific interface. And of course, properly verify the DHCP server.</p>
<p>All these issues are well known and ages old. So I don&#8217;t understand why this is a sophisticated attack. It is a simple hijacking of a gateway.</p>

<p>Well, what can I say&#8230;</p>
<p>Jila is a traditional girls name in Persian and like many names that are old it has a meaning as well (google &#8220;Jila meaning&#8221;). This meaning has become &#8220;Westernised&#8221; and thus Jila is now used in a slang form to describe a certain type of personality / behaviour.</p>
<p>The result of this is that Jila has been used for the name of &#8220;Gentleman&#8217;s clubs&#8221; where women of a certain type can be found&#8230;</p>

				<p>Not Warm &#8216;n Fuzzy</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what would kill this and similar attacks: &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Would it? Let&#8217;s see. Jo is sitting at some linux box with systemd (&#8220;Another year and firefox will be built in, too&#8221;), the dhcp server is in some metal garbage box (i a company settng. At home them boxen are plastic garbage boxen) running some old creepy linux, too &#8230;</p>
<p>And you seriously think that a not yet implemented (certainly not on modem/router boxen running linux 2.6 &#8230;) dhcp authentication artifact based on md5 will make the whole thing somehow secure?<br />
I assume you meant to be funny and to make a joke with us.</p>
<p>Btw, <em>nothing</em>, bloody nothing will make our systems secure as long as there are dozens of MCUs and processors in it which most of us don&#8217;t even know live in our systems and as long as 99,5% (give or take some promille) chose either systemd or one of the &#8220;we sell you completely out&#8221; company A or company B OS to run on them boxen, plus, of course, loads of crapware &#8220;developed&#8221; in languages that are all but guaranteed to deliver high levels of bugs per kloc.</p>
<p>But you know what? I don&#8217;t care cause I&#8217;m secure. For a measly 39,90$ I got myself a symersky &#8220;net guardian 4.0&#8221; and <em>of course</em> I chose wisely by buying only from a fine company like symersky who can offer a golden &#8220;100% secure&#8221; sticker.</p>
<p>Being the smart pro I am I put that sticker smack on my hell 3000XRS6 system (with dual nvidia gpus). I&#8217;m more than ready for them evil guys, hehe.</p>

				<p>Not Warm &#8216;n Fuzzy, all the OS would have to do to prevent this attack is to not immediately send traffic to a USB network device simply because it appeared. The user should have to enable it first.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d have to be careful with relying on 802.1X. It&#8217;s normally used by a client to authenticate to the network, not the other way around. It&#8217;s probably possible to use that way, but I&#8217;d also not be surprised if an OS saw a network demanding authentication and dumped your password into some weak scheme like NTLM. And if an OS is so promiscuous as to start sending on whatever adapters are plugged in, it&#8217;s probably not going to avoid the network simply because there&#8217;s no 802.1X.</p>
<p>I think socket APIs should let applications mark some sockets as &#8220;secure&#8221; (meaning the traffic will be encrypted and authenticated, resistant to MitM). Eventually, we could then reject all insecure traffic unless a network was specifically set to allow itâwhich one might do for the main home/work connection but not for coffee shop wifi or USB adapters that appear from nowhere.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>That&#8217;s certainly annoying and looks suspicious. In an enterprise setting, it&#8217;s none of my business as I am the owner of nothing. On my personal machine, I own everything, and I don&#8217;t welcome unadvertised &#8220;features&#8221;. Anything that happens on my device must happen with my consent.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Sure, it is the most reasonable approach to security.  I am not against honest features that can be disabled and should be this way by default.  Most features these days however cannot be completely disabled.  It is a shame how our computers are not &#8220;our&#8221; anymore.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>So I stay away from devices that have a &#8220;manageability engine&#8221;. If I power my device off, I want the LAN, WiFi and everything else to be off. The alternative is to unplug the device from power and remove all cables which is a hassle. Another method it to add hardware switches that disconnect or connect selected ports such as LANs. These hardware switches must not be susceptible to &#8220;remote attacks&#8221;. When the device is on, traffic must be funneled through an external firewall / switch / router that&#8217;s exclusively under the owner&#8217;s control.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>What choices do you have?  Open source hardware is either expensive or underpowered (most of times both of them).  Soekris computers, PC Engines Apu/ALIX boards, Raspberry Pi computers, beaglebones&#8230; are better approaches but are not free from these dangerous features either.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Wrap the HW with controls that only you can manage. Assume all HW / FW / SW is backdoored either deliberately, or because some idiot developer decides to get &#8220;cutsie&#8221;.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>How can we wrap the hardware with controls that only we can manage if we do not know exactly what is wrong?</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Easy! Just put electric tape on the blinking LEDs! ð</i></p></blockquote>
<p>My first though was epoxy on the Ethernet port but your approach is better.  We feel &#8220;more secure&#8221; with electric tape and we do not really lose privacy if we consider the huge amount of ways we are under surveillance right now.</p>

<p>@ab praeceptis:<br />
Artifact, md5&#8230; Where is this coming from. Go read about wpa_supplicant/hostapd and freeradius for a list of supported protocols. They are not all md5 based. And yes, it will make things more secure because you&#8217;ll add additional step of verifying the DHCP server.</p>
<p>Ofc, as Sebastian mentioned, the is must not automatically configure new network interfaces appearing out of nowhere. And I claim this is more or less is a default. For example, on my machine there are 7 interfaces, 2 real and 5 virtual for containers and VMs. Nevertheless, nothing sends dhcp requests on those, and I didn&#8217;t need to do anything special for that&#8230;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s from the link you provided or, more precisely, from the link there to the rfc.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s there, in that rfc, that they talk about md5 (and vaguely of sha[unspecified] sometimes in the future). Well noted that is said in an rfc with very little take up/implementation.<br />
They btw. also talk about a pre-shared secret. Pardon me, but that whole thingy looks like there is damn good reason for very limited take-up.</p>
<p>Btw, there is nothing in ones way to configure ones machines to use whatever gateway one pleases rather than blindly obeying to dhcp. More generally (albeit widely unknown) a client can clearly specify what he wishes to get from a dhcp server and it can also specify that only a specific dhcp server is asked. In case you are interested -&gt; dhcp-options(5).</p>
<p>Which boils down to: That whole attack scenario is only working with stupid eat-everything clients and careless minimal auto-setups.</p>
<p>I tell you that Symersky is missing a billion dollar fortune by not selling &#8220;Symersky security linux&#8221;. With a golden sticker, of course.</p>

				<p>What you guys miss, is that every single core Linux distro that include &#8216;network manager&#8217; e.g. the &#8216;desktop&#8217; ones including the &#8216;penetration&#8217; distros automatically configure wired interfaces.</p>
<p>Well, pentoo comes oob in silent mode but that&#8217;s the only one I&#8217;m aware of and I don&#8217;t own a pi to test this. Maybe it could be compiled for many n5 for otg?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still a great display of cost of defence vs cost of attack, this type of autoconf is not the first time network manager has led to incursions.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t even ran slack, I&#8217;m sure coreos doesn&#8217;t do this either and I find myself wondering about qubes too.</p>

Hmm, networkmanager in fedora 24 doesn&#8217;t doanything to a 2nd NIC on the motherboard, only puts it in UP state. I&#8217;d say even this is a bug, but a minor one. It definitely doesn&#8217;t run dhclient on it&#8230;</p>
