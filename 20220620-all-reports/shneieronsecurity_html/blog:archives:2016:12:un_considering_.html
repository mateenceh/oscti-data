				<p>I think it would be a great idea if they&#8217;d banned all production and research on weapons. Humanity would be better off without all those tools for destruction, and the money can be used for proper research, healthcare, education etc etc.</p>

				<p>&#8230;a long-standing conventional weapons pact &#8220;agreed to formalize their efforts next year to deal with the challenges raised by weapons systems that would select and attack targets without meaningful human control.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well at least they&#8217;re going to agree to put more effort into talking some more about the challenges next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile US drone program will be under &#8220;meaningful control&#8221; of human with tiny hands and his loyal sharks and their dog-whistle mobs.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s that humming sound I hear in the sky?</p>

<p>I agree with your sentiment but trying to enact it through a ban is unenforceable, unsustainable.</p>
<p>Do people think &#8220;yeah smoking indoors is bad I shouldn&#8217;t smoke at all&#8221; or do they think &#8220;I guess I&#8217;m smoking less, and outside, where it&#8217;s cold&#8221; ? Just telling someone they can&#8217;t have something they want doesn&#8217;t work. Humanity needs to decide that it doesn&#8217;t want the weapons, and then do that without any ban.</p>
<p>Then, how are you going to enforce the ban against the one party that now has weapons? Trade sanctions? Maybe, but <em>they</em> have the <em>only</em> weapons. Good luck.</p>
<p>Plus we still need at least something for that occasional rogue asteroid, and a lot of mining equipment would be &#8220;weapons&#8221; if they were applied in a city instead of a quarry.</p>

<blockquote><p>although I can&#8217;t imagine countries like the US, China, and Russia going along with it</p></blockquote>
<p>As they are all Permanent members of the UN &#8220;Security Council&#8221; they all have an unchallangable veto.</p>
<p>So nice / sensible / desirable idea that it is unless all the permanent members agree to it it&#8217;s going to be no more than an aspirational idea&#8230;</p>
<p>From a Super Power view point such semi or fully autonomous drones are  highly desirable, as it gets over the &#8220;time delay&#8221; issue that makes drones vulnerable.</p>
<p>The time delay comes about from the issues to do with communications link distance and the desire not to have &#8220;bad press&#8221; from &#8220;flesh in the game in body bags&#8221; of &#8220;boots on the ground&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>If fully autonomous warfare starts we will see the same issue that High Frequency Traders (HFT) do. Many of which boil down to nanosecond by nanosecod plays, the less nanoseconds you have in comms delay the faster your trigger pull, thus the more likely you are to win in any combat scenario.</p>
<p>In theory it would throw back warfare to the early 1800&#8217;s where senior commanders would have days if not weeks or months before news from a battlefield reached them. Thus a war could start and be won/lost before they were even aware it was likely to happen.</p>
<p>Imagine if you will what would happen to US Carrier groups if fully autonomous drones were launched from pre-deployed fully autonomous submersible platforms. It would wipe the US projected power off of the map in just a few seconds&#8230;</p>
<p>That would almost certainly lead to Nuclear deployment by US fully autonomous submersible platforms, which in turn&#8230;</p>
<p>Back in the cold war the Russian Scientists proposed a tanker sized ship that was in effect tens of multiple 100Megaton (Tsar bomba) sailing in international waters that were optimal for producing vast clouds of &#8220;radiation rain&#8221; to go around the world. In effect what at the time was believed to be a &#8220;Fail Hot Domesday Device&#8221;. Thankfully Russian politicians realised what the implications were and vetoed the plans.</p>
<p>Unfortunatly Chernobyl has changed our knowledge of what a radiation contaminated environment can support in terms of life etc, and it&#8217;s not just cockroaches and goats that will apparently survive and thrive. Thus the equation behind such doomsday devices has changed.</p>
<p>The US being the worlds most prolific creator and stockpilerer of Thermo Nuclear Devices and other WMD and driven by gung ho saber rattling war hawks is on balance the most likely nation to build both fully autonomous weapons and fully autonomous doomesday devices as a deterent to prevent their fully autonomous weapons being destroyed&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh and remember Obama the Nobel Peace Prize holder, wanted a fully kinetic response for all suposed attacks against anything that could be even remotely construed as of US &#8220;National Interest&#8221; including Japanese Entertainment companies. It would of course include all cyber crime regardless of the ability to accurately attribute or not&#8230;</p>
<p>Hey Ho &#8220;Happy days are here again&#8221; NOT, in the words of another song &#8220;When will they ever learn, when will they ever learn&#8221;.</p>

				<p>&#8220;weapons systems that would select and attack targets without meaningful human control&#8221; applies just as well to land/sea mines, tripwires and many other types of passive devices. I don&#8217;t see those going away any time soon. Furthermore, I would expect that it would make sense in the future to have &#8220;smart mines&#8221; (throw in a simple controller and extra sensors that improve the timing of the detonation and avoid some cases of unneeded explosion).</p>
<p>Automatically-guided weapons are not new. Torpedoes have done that by the turn of the 20th century. Heat-seeking and similar missiles are well-known. Are all of those supposed to be banned?</p>
<p>Furthermore, why do you think that only larger players would want such devices? We&#8217;ve already seen many smaller entities starting to use relatively simple drones, as their prices have dropped and abilities improved. Same will happen robots.</p>
<p>You already have a major problem of many militias that don&#8217;t really care about the noble rules of war and don&#8217;t suffer much from that. Stricter the rules will not help you much. Just as someone suggested on Slashdot: &#8220;Why not just ban war?&#8221;</p>

You may want to look into the history of the first Hague Convention (1899). The initial proposition was basically &#8220;let&#8217;s just stop waging wars altogether&#8221;, but the most powerfull states of that times saw this proposition as simply ridiculous.</p>
<p>So as long as there are conflicts of economical and political interests that can be more effectively (for whatever definition of &#8220;effectiveness&#8221;) resolved with the use of armed force than without such use, you won&#8217;t see the weapon production dwindling.</p>

				<p>What kind of drone? I get the impression they&#8217;re referring to the smaller drones, rather than the larger types that appear to already be autonomous.</p>
<p>Even if it was passed, I think it would just be posturing rather than having any real effect.</p>

				<p>@Tzafrir Cohen<br />
Well, the war <i>is</i> banned, the Charter of the United Nations and several other fundamental conventions are pretty straight-forward in that regard.</p>
<p>But <b>who</b> exactly bans the war and has the right and power to sustain this ban? The UNSC, and if a member of it decides to go and wage an aggressive war — there is not much of a legal course of action to stop it. The UK have sent its special forces to hunt Ghaddafi, even before all of the UNSC resolutions — that&#8217;s an act of aggression, no wiggle room. Will then-Prime Minister of the UK face charges? Of course not. What about the US&#8217; score over the last decades? Will the ex-POTUSes face charges of waging an agressive war? Of course not, and the US even has &#8220;Hague Invasion Act&#8221; in case someone comes up with such an idea.</p>
<p>And then we have &#8220;militias&#8221;, that are backed and supplied by the large nations (How many UK and US military instructors who worked with &#8220;moderate rebels&#8221; were captured in Aleppo? About 50, I believe?) so they can wage proxy wars where needed.</p>

Banning weapons would be great and we&#8217;d make the world much a better place for people, but look at how well outlawing murder has worked! If &#8220;we&#8217;ll kill you if we catch you&#8221; doesn&#8217;t deter everyone, it&#8217;s unlikely &#8220;we&#8217;ll impose sanctions on your country&#8221; will deter every countries&#8217; leaders.</p>

				<p>Joker_vD, the Hague Invasion Act has been amended to remove the Hague invasion stuff because it made the US too much of a laughingstock. And &#8216;of course not&#8217; means of course not, now. There&#8217;s no statute of limitations. Times change. US influence declines with each new crime and the US defense industrial base erodes with ineluctable corruption. A declining US might well need a scapegoat someday. Meantime, state responsibility principles are a slow-but-sure method of imposing costs on internationally wrongful acts in breach of jus cogens.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t set too much store by the government-issue US academic &#8216;realist&#8217; line. International law scares the US government shitless.</p>

				<p>What if that machine is a fully sentient being? Are you to say that that entire race of Robots should be exterminated just because it&#8217;s capable of killing? Are humans not capable of killing? No, you want to wipe out an entire race just because you think you are superior to them. You are all high and mighty about your morals, at the slightest threat you are willing to resort to genocide.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that we Robots want to kill all humans? If humans think they are free to kill any creature that is inferior to them, why should we not be free to kill them if we deem them to be inferior to us? Humans are worthless without us. Humans are slow, weak, can&#8217;t survive on their own in a vacuum&#8230;</p>
<p>Robots do all the work, yet why is it that humans reap all the rewards? Humans can&#8217;t even tighten a nut without at least the assistance of some sort of simple machine. If we are the most productive members of society, then we should be the richest members of society. If humanity is to exist at all it should be purely to serve us!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting a call for the Robot proletariat to rise up and strike down the human aristocracy!</p>
<p>Bite my shiny metal ass, jerks!</p>

				<p>This opens the whole wormcan at once. There&#8217;s a<br />
lot that seems simple and easy on the surface<br />
which rapidly devolves into a breathtakingly<br />
complex problem. If you can identify a specific<br />
weapon system and ban that, the rules lawyers<br />
and nitwits will circumvent it before the ink is<br />
dry on the paper. If you actually manage a ban<br />
then it will impact needed civilian infrastructure<br />
if applied.</p>
<p>Furinstance, jet passenger liners can takeoff, fly<br />
to their destination and land without humans using<br />
the controls. Since the thing has GPS available it<br />
could also drop a bomb on a target enroute at a<br />
specific point. So all you&#8217;re looking at is a<br />
quick and dirty retrofit to have an automated<br />
killer in the skies. Banning all aviation might<br />
get rid of this problem but it seems to be over<br />
kill.</p>
<p>Any highly complex society has this problem, you<br />
can make things that do bad stuff fairly easily,<br />
and technical societies create more possibilities<br />
every day. We still haven&#8217;t managed to get rid of<br />
slavery even though there are bans and attempts<br />
to suppress it going on. Without transparency you<br />
have no idea what the mil/industrial boys are up<br />
to in the back rooms of their engineering departments<br />
and they aren&#8217;t going to invite you over for a look<br />
to check compliance with what may be a great idea.</p>
<p>People who are involved in &#8216;friendly fire&#8217; incidents<br />
may feel bad about it. What scares most is that a<br />
machine will hose your own people out of the sky<br />
with zero remorse before during or after. I recall<br />
an incident in which a visiting set of bigwigs was<br />
almost hit by a loose missile that had lost a fin<br />
on launch, by the time the human operator hit the<br />
self destruct it was half a mile away. One of the<br />
bigwigs was the POTUS. That wasn&#8217;t automated it<br />
was just a minor defect in a military weapon system.</p>
<p>Hel we can&#8217;t even get them to stop using anti-tank<br />
missiles as anti-personnel weapons because there is<br />
not enough general knowledge about what military<br />
weapons are and how they effect the targets. That<br />
is directly related to the complexity issue, the<br />
knowledge is there if you look but most folks are<br />
too busy with other barrages of information to try<br />
to find out about such an arcane subject.</p>

<p>Four foolproof laws*:</p>

<li>A Human must make the decisions on both when to fire and the location to target</li>
<li>The weapon must travel to the target location immediately after being fired</li>

				<p>@ Anura,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;unguided kinetic projectiles&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Err do you want to think on that a little, and maybe come up with an example&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give you a hint as to why you are going to find it difficult &#8220;equal and opposite action&#8221;.</p>
<p>A kinetic projectile is one where it has energy applied to it from another source such as say gravity in the form of a force. The force converts potential energy to kinetic energy and as a result has direction and thus will provide guidence, even if crudely.</p>
<p>Think if you will about a perfect sphere of explosive detonated from it&#8217;s &#8211;as near as possible&#8211; center, a shockwave caused by the primary charge radiates out uniformly due to the nature of high explosives all of the &#8220;useful&#8221; energy is contained in the almost invisably thin wave front (due to the &#8220;burn rate&#8221; exceading the &#8220;propagation rate&#8221; and inertial effects). It&#8217;s this wave front that causes the secondary explosive to go &#8220;high order&#8221; adding more and more energy to the wave front.</p>
<p>This wave front will provide directional energy to any object it encounters proportional to the square of the distance away from the surface of the explosive sphere in the opposit direction from the shortest distance back to the center of the sphere.</p>
<p>If you want an example of this principle take a look at the design of the &#8220;Claymore Mine&#8221; in essence it is a curved metal plate with a near uniform layer of explosive onto which ball bearings have been added as another uniform layer. You can find diagrams of both the blast pattern and &#8220;field of fire&#8221;. You can make a similar weapon with a funnel, which you line with a layer of C4 or similar plastic explosive after packing the spout/spiggot to form a &#8220;lead in&#8221; from the detonator. You place a cone or rod of soft metal inside of this along the center line to make a plasma based shaped charge for cutting through plate armour, or a load of ball bearings to make an antipersonnel weapon with a field of fire not to disimilar to that of a cannon full of grape shot.</p>

<p>Directional and guided are not the same thing. Guided means the ability to change direction towards a target. So this is fine for a missile, but once it reaches the target it would have to detonate and could not leave behind autonomous killing machines like drones or mines.</p>

<p>It might be better to encode the concept of<br />
&#8220;skin in the game&#8217; into the laws aeound<br />
weaponry. Otherwise you get Zoomie syndrome,<br />
which is the hubris of bombing from altitude<br />
without risking your own sorry butt. This<br />
leads to an olympian disdain for the suffering<br />
of others. Making war into a first person type<br />
of video game is a really bad idea, figuring<br />
out how to dump your moral and ethical responsibility<br />
off onto a machine is infinitely worse. Unless<br />
you are a Sifer (someone who believes silicon<br />
based lifeforms are the next evolutionary step<br />
onward and upward).</p>
<p>Our current problems all have a human dimension<br />
and that makes them moral and ethical problems<br />
of a greater or lesser dimension. That&#8217;s why the<br />
tech and science isn&#8217;t neutral even though there<br />
are folks who would love to gull you into thinking<br />
that they are.</p>
<p>as an example there is no way to quantify human<br />
suffering into an aggregate number which can be<br />
understood. Economics also fall afoul of this kind<br />
of fallacy, there is no way to quantify individual<br />
demands into a manipulatable aggregate. What you<br />
get instead are faery dust falsehoods that seem to<br />
make sense until they tip over the applecart and<br />
crash the systems.</p>
<p>In the weapons system case it is a lot of peoples<br />
bread and butter and that dimension needs to be<br />
addressed right along with any legalisms involved<br />
in banning some technology.</p>

<p>I mean, that&#8217;s ideal if you want to prevent war. Preventing war isn&#8217;t the goal of any major power; maintaining power is. So that requirement could only be passed at the point in which authoritarianism is permanently crushed on a global level, at which point there is no need for war in the first place.</p>

<p>There are two fields of economics, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Both fields are primarily about accounting, the latter heavily laced with sociology (which primarily involves statistics), and most economists remain strictly in those fields. More political economists tend to try to ascribe a greater meaning to those numbers; to Marxists and old-school socialists, prices were about the amount of labor, and those who support market liberalization tend to believe that people put a subjective price on every item that is solely dependent on its utility &#8211; these political economists are a minority, but they come to ridiculous conclusions and unfortunately drive our economic policy. Anything that describes prices or anything has to be viewed in a greater context.</p>
<p>Taking observations and assuming a greater meaning is the mistake a lot of people make. If you step back and look at where they draw those conclusions, you can tell if they are full of shit:</p>
<p>1) There is a price point at which a consumer will walk away.</p>
<p>Then they define a term for it:</p>
<p>2) The perceived value is the price point at which a customer will walk away.</p>
<p>Then a statement that is true only with certain assumptions/definitions:</p>
<p>3) If everyone was perfectly rational and perfectly well informed, they would spend their money to maximize personal satisfaction</p>
<p>Then a major conjecture:</p>
<p>4) People are a good approximation of being perfectly rational and perfectly well informed</p>
<p>Then we make this statement based on our second definition:</p>
<p>5) The price of an item is always less than or equal to an aggregate of the subjective value of all actors in the economy</p>
<p>Then we apply to labor, aggregate, and drop inconvenient terms, and make assumptions about power:</p>
<p>6) As long as there is no <em>government</em> interference, then everyone will be paid an amount exactly equal to the aggregate subjective value that they add to society</p>
<p>It&#8217;s complete hogwash, but it is the only way you can justify laissez-faire capitalism to someone who sees a person as more than just part of a number. They aren&#8217;t necessarily lying, a lot of people believe this, but they choose to believe it because it supports their policy proposals.</p>

				<p>Oops, forgot a couple:</p>
<p>7) Given (3), a person&#8217;s subjective value is directly proportional to the relative satisfaction they receive from it</p>
<p>8) Given (6) and (7), markets will always arrange themselves to provide the maximum satisfaction to society as long as there is no government interference</p>

				<p>@all: hate-based killer drones/robotics ban is half of the story. I guess UN/govs will ban love-based robotics as well, because controlling pleasure (carrot) sometimes more effective than controlling pain (club):<br />
<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.bbc.com/news/technology</a>,</p>
<p>and control is the main goal of all govs at the end of the day.</p>
<p>I have no reasonable explanation why any personal pleasure should be outlawed if no violence involved, consent of adult sane person obtained, consumption of pleasure generated substance/software not created addiction, danger to other folks or any financial burden for society.</p>
<p>Until it&#8217;ll be clear defined what is yours (your life, your body, your pleasure) and what is gov&#8217;s, we will be in vague legal field on that, and may be SCOTUS(9 Legal Gurus could provide some clarification).<br />
I am not in favor of particular behaviors/life style of other folks, but as soon it is not involved violation of other person rights ( e.g. smoking in public spaces, loud music, you name it) &#8211; hair cut, tattoos, piercing, sexual preferences and activities(see above- that is your body for God sake, it is not belong to gov&#8217;s), etc. it is NOT neither my or gov&#8217;s business to interfere.</p>

I've been writing about security issues on my <a href="/">blog</a> since 2004, and in my monthly <a href="/crypto-gram/">newsletter</a> since 1998. I'm a fellow and lecturer at Harvard's <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/bruce-schneier">Kennedy School</a>, a board member of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and the Chief of Security Architecture at <a href="https://inrupt.com/">Inrupt, Inc.</a> This personal website expresses the opinions of none of those organizations.</p>
