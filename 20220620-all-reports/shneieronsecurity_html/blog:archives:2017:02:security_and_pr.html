<p>They all largely say the same things: avoid known vulnerabilities, don&#8217;t have insecure defaults, make your systems patchable, and so on.</p>
<p>My guess is that everyone knows that IoT <a href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/01/the-internet-of-things-dangerous-future-bruce-schneier.html">regulation is coming</a>, and is either trying to impose self-regulation to forestall government action or establish principles to influence government action. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how the next few years unfold.</p>
<p>If there are any IoT security or privacy guideline documents that I&#8217;m missing, please tell me in the comments. </p>
<p>EDITED TO ADD: Documents added to the list, above.</p>

				<p>When it comes to Internet-connected toilets equipped with video cameras for automatic flush, I&#8217;ve reached my limit, and I&#8217;m more than ready to vomit.</p>
<p>If even the Amish kids are known to tip over outhouses for a prank, I certainly do not want this entire generation of drug-addled Internet brats raised on corn smut to be &#8220;enabled&#8221; to commit all manner of similar but higher-tech pranks with the Internet of Things.</p>

<p><i>If there are any IoT security or privacy guideline documents that I&#8217;m missing, please tell me in the comments.</i></p>
<p>Yes. Follow @internetofshit on Twitter. For the layman, it&#8217;s probably more comprehensive, educational and frightening than any essay, presentation or guideline can ever be.</p>

				<p>Nice. But useless. The school teachers and university professors are about asserting their authority. And most of them are way over their heads. Yet parents don&#8217;t know any better and are pushing their children to buy insurance &#8211; meaning the institutional paper instead of knowledge and practical experience. So security is somewhere at the end of the list for all the players, but a handful of geeks, most of whom have a real hard time interacting with anything but people alike them. And these few geeks are cheating the people anyway because all I can find online is these few dry tech documents. And lots of frustrated pointless howls. And psychiatric cases talking about alien lizard conspiracies.</p>
<p>One way out would be to realize your position: you are not John the Baptist calling up for Jesus. You are not the Messiah to save the world from something. Most of the people reading this are barely qualified for their daily jobs. Not enough that they can quit tomorrow and rest assured that in June or 10 years from now they would still be employable.</p>
<p>Rising awareness is for people like Bono from U2 and Leo diCaprio whose only competence is in reading the teleprompter.</p>
<p>YOU COULD DO SOMETHING. Something practical.</p>
<p>And there is anything to do.</p>
<p>Open Source hardware is either 15 year old laptops that barely work with free software. Or so called advanced junk like Arduino. Sure, you can play with it. And it might be miraculous. For 1972.</p>
<p>Open Source software is either the clone of a 10 year old software pack or labeled pre-alpha and partially functional.</p>
<p>Information is scarce and of low to very low quality.</p>
<p>So forget the lizards and the bilderbergs! Things happen because YOU DO ZERO.</p>
<p>Nobody is stopping you do anything. But you have to learn enough to do the job. Nobody is stopping you make the next Facebook. You could be ethical and sh<em>t money at the same time. But if your product is sh</em>t like your life, the users are proportional with the quality of the product once the buzz is off.</p>

				<p>One needs to recognize that Internet of Things is likely to be considered all encompassing.  That is, the definition will eventually include all cell phones, devices that communicate in way whatever, your home computers, cars, medical implants, and your personal drones.  Ultimately, it will include YOU directly with your own implanted chip, medical or not.</p>
<p>The overall purpose is to KNOW everything about you for ultimate influence, imtimidation, and control.  Due to the advancment of the electronic age we are in, you are no longer a citizen but effectively a property of the state and/or big business.</p>
<p>Eventually, I expect laws to be passed requiring all such things or to the gulag you go.  Individuality no longer, humanity even less.</p>
<p>Stark?  Even a small part of the above qualifies.</p>

				<p>&#8220;My guess is that everyone knows that IoT regulation is coming, and is either trying to impose self-regulation to forestall government action or establish principles to influence government action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huh? Where in the world do you get that idea? Strange bias. The best I can tell, you never mentioned the Internet of Things until after it had become a pop buzzword. You invariably respond to anything new with contempt, dismissing it as hype. Like the Cloud. Later you compose a primer and get it published in, say, the Atlantic or The New Yorker or similar. As if you come around just in time to regain expertise. But this? It is a really weird statement given how some groups were hard at work long before you got out of bed. And your obsession with gov&#8217;t regulation, I guess, is simply wishful thinking.</p>

				<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m still looking for recommendations that may have been touted previously, for how the gov&#8217;t needs to step in and commence regulation of routers and switches and, maybe some new committee could be established to force companies to use their new routing protocols. Of course, then you&#8217;ll need to get the special certification and classes take a year to get into, and more fees and more fees. Wanna bet that big shots like IBM will be the only companies that afford to push out new products? How convenient. Hey, it&#8217;ll be good for progress and it&#8217;ll enhance innovation (just not ours).</p>

				<p>It is telling that we have heard no news stories (except for transparent advertising ie press releases) about any IoT devices that actually follow these guidelines.</p>
<p>The cynic in me thinks that we haven&#8217;t heard of any such devices because there are no such devices.  And this would be backed up by my experience of the companies making them. Most of them have answered queries with statements like &#8220;Oh, security.  We don&#8217;t have any engineers to spare for that&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;but the customer database is how we develop marketing value!&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet I have hope that they exist but we haven&#8217;t heard about them because without breaches and exploits they don&#8217;t make the news, and I haven&#8217;t heard from those companies because they just don&#8217;t need outside security people.  But that doesn&#8217;t seem likely.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t buy any IoT products for my own house.  I don&#8217;t even install samples of IoT devices I&#8217;m working on in my house.  And most people who work with the security issues of IoT devices make the same decision.  It says something when the pros don&#8217;t actually use the products&#8230;.</p>

<p><i>And your obsession with gov&#8217;t regulation, I guess, is simply wishful thinking.</i></p>
<p>More like a very sensible proposal as opposed to the usual crowd singing the praise of automagically self-regulating free markets, then crying &#8220;terrorism&#8221; when a script kiddie in Romania suddenly shuts down their ridiculously insecure fridge and their pacemaker. Just to carry on with the same radical rejection of any type of regulation once the dust has settled. Ever heard of cognitive dissonance ?</p>

				<p>Hey Bruce mentioned this in another comment/post.</p>
<p>Ideas for low-cost government involvement that doesn&#8217;t lead to de facto surveillance and propaganda authorities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Software security labeling system (similar to FDA food labeling) so increase the level of market-consumable information available.</li>
<li>Repository of publicly funded code snippets that achieve strong security properties (i.e. )</li>
<li>Project to create a next-generation infrastructure, from silicon (Harvard vs VN vs Miller architecture) to routing protocols, to authentication protocols.</li>
<li>A tax on insecure products.</li>
<li>
<p>A customer advocacy pipeline to bring suit against companies that fraudulently overemphasize their security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security research grant/funding for academia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provisions to laws that makes security research and disclosure safer and less liable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public support for free(dom) software principles, including the ability of people to investigate the software that behaves on their behalf.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s think outside the box.</p>

<p>I read Ion&#8217;s comment very differently. If I could translate how I perceived his comment:</p>
<p>Nobody really cares about cyber security. It&#8217;s an overblown problem with a simple solution. The people who are loud about it are generally paranoid or overly obsessed with their small corner of the world. These people (the loud ones about cyber security) think of themselves as saviors and noblemen, while really they are kind of pathetic people with superiority complexes.</p>
<p>The simple solution is for programmers and security folks to stop the alarmist and build the solutions themselves &#8211; and not be lazy about building the solutions. Get the security right.</p>
<p>Ion did I read that correctly? Is that what you were saying?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also already solutions on the market that cover quite a few bases. I haven&#8217;t reviewed the ones below or thought on the implementation quality. Just giving them as examples:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iconlabs.com/prod/products/floodgate-iot-security-toolkit" rel="nofollow ugc">Floodgate IOT Security Toolkit</a></p>
<p>Green Hills has platforms for <a href="http://www.ghs.com/secure_networking.html" rel="nofollow ugc">networking</a> and <a href="http://www.ghs.com/products/industrial_safety.html" rel="nofollow ugc">industrial</a> that they&#8217;re probably combining into an IOT-style solution for customers. Lynx has a dedicated <a href="http://www.lynx.com/meeting-the-needs-of-the-internet-of-things-iot/" rel="nofollow ugc">IOT package</a>. Wind River <a href="https://www.windriver.com/news/press/pr.html?ID=13181" rel="nofollow ugc">added</a> similar security to VxWorks platform. OK Labs&#8217; toolkit that General Dynamics bought should be usable for IOT but page is down. Mitre just <a href="https://www.mitre.org/news/press-releases/mitre-announces-winner-of-internet-of-things-iot-challenge" rel="nofollow ugc">concluded</a> some competition with some other players.</p>
<p>So, if people care to spend, there&#8217;s solutions they can license right now to cover most of the bases companies are hitting them with. Several with good, endpoint protection on top of that. Combine with custom code done in SPARK Ada, high-integrity Java, or Rust for even better odds. It&#8217;s sort of a financial &amp; integration problem at this point to knock out vast majority of risk while maintaining fast, development pace. Apathy and greed prevail.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s already been done successfully via DOD&#8217;s Computer Security Initiative. Bell describes its rise and fall <a href="http://lukemuehlhauser.com/wp-content/uploads/Bell-Looking-Back-Addendum.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">here</a>. It&#8217;s being done for software safety right now under quite a few regimes of certification, esp DO-178B/C. The industry not only produced the high-quality components: third-party tools showed up all over the place to accelerate both productivity and assurance of correctness. SPARK Ada, Esterel SCADE, separation kernels I referenced above, and even <a href="http://richlandtechnologies.com/products/embedded-graphics-libraries/software-graphics-renderer/" rel="nofollow ugc">graphics drivers/libraries</a>. Wasn&#8217;t sure I&#8217;d ever see that last one done robustly on modern hardware. 😉</p>
<p>So, a repeat of CSI or DO-178B-style regulation with sane, straight-forward profiles for requirements of given types of hardware (Common Criteria minus the bullshit) seem to be best route. It worked before. It should work again.</p>

<p>I was going to be snarky again, but there is a lot of truth in what you say the way you have expressed it.  Nobody <i>in control</i> really cares <i>enough</i> about it.  Think <i>decision makers</i>.  Big business.  The simplest <i>correct</i> solution is often the best and often overlooked.  &#8220;The loud ones about cyber security&#8221; are of course those who profit the most from all the hype.  &#8220;Their small corner of the world&#8221; is of course some proprietary &#8220;solution&#8221; or another they offer to non-technical makers of technical business decisions.</p>
<blockquote><p>The simple solution is for programmers and security folks to stop the alarmist and build the solutions themselves &#8211; and not be lazy about building the solutions. Get the security right.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is exactly right.  But the main obstacles are in the domain of business and politics rather than technology.  This is because all too many of the &#8220;solutions&#8221; on the market are highly <i>proprietary</i>; incomplete; crippled; deliberately restricted in functionality, extensibility, and customers&#8217; access to their own data; and sold by huge corporations with immense international political lobbying power.</p>
<p>This is why we discuss free and open source software so much on this forum.  The source code is available and subject to public audit and public modification, experimentation, and distribution.</p>

Vulnerability Disclosure / Dec 16 IoT Security Foundation</p>
<p>Both complement the IoT Security Compliance Framework&#8230; more in the making for 2017.</p>

<p><a href="https://iotsecurityfoundation.org/best-practice-guidelines/" rel="nofollow ugc"></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve taken the approach to produce guidance for those that need it most in the first instance (and those that may be inclined to ignore their duty of care to the rest of us) &#8211; i.e. those who want to get to market quickly but lack understanding of security.</p>
<p>Security needs to be consumable and the IoTSF Framework / Best Practice Guidelines are free of course, so few excuses.</p>
<p>For completeness &#8211; Establishing Principles for IoT Security was early 2016 &#8211; a taster document.</p>
<p>On regulation &#8211; we should welcome it because it is necessary. However, we need to make sure it&#8217;s right-sized and that can only be considered with reference to the application. We&#8217;re working on the concept of a Trustmark in Europe as part of the bigger picture&#8230; the threat of connection cannot be ignored.</a></p>

<p>When we need a specious disclaimer like that for every online opinion or comment offered, supposedly in order to maintain potential employability at the aforementioned huge corporations, it just goes to show that those corporations have become all too powerful.  And I don&#8217;t doubt it, either.</p>
<p>Those corporations are definitely colluding to censor opinions expressed online, and they will definitely blacklist potential applicants for jobs.</p>

				<p>Most of the documents shown here, both by Bruce and readers like Eric V and Ted, fail on a fundamental level: these documents are targeted to IoT appliance designers and manufacturers, not to the few end users that appreciate security.</p>
<p>Industry wants benefit so they try cutting costs, and most times they do it very hard.  Security, on the other hand, is expensive.  Now consider that most customers want something cool, not something secure or privacy-friendly and you have the perfect recipe to a disaster.</p>
<p>IoT will be a security/privacy disaster and these papers will become a nice academic exercise only.  But don&#8217;t worry, technology is full of profitable privacy disasters like Apple, Google, Microsoft and the National Security Agency.</p>

				<p>@Whomever,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care what happens to individual users of IoT devices; it&#8217;s a case of buyer beware. I -do- care about the effects hacking them have on others who are not part of the IoT fad.</p>
<p>Regulation: Government regulation happens at the will and pleasure of the Corporatocracy. That said, there is only one law I&#8217;d like to see passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be illegal for any manufacturer, software or service provider, to absolve themselves of responsibility for their product or service, via TOS, EULA, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that perfect (or even decent) security is impossible, simple steps can reduce the effects of IoT hacking:</p>
<ol>
<li>Force strong passwords. </li>
<li>Disallow remote programmability.</li>
<li>Use simple, basic open-source code.</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn&#8217;t expand these points because we&#8217;ve already discussed them, at length.</p>
<p>. .. . .. &#8212; &#8230;.</p>

				<p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>I wrote an in-depth report called <a href="http://bit.ly/iotprivacyreport" rel="nofollow ugc">Privacy and the Internet of Things</a> that explores IoT privacy risks and the existing frameworks to address them. It contains some approaches you&#8217;ve not listed. I run a nonprofit called the Internet of Things Privacy Forum that is dedicated to researching and discussing these topics.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Dr Gilad Rosner</p>

				<p>Depending on your definition of &#8216;thing&#8217;, there is the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards also being developed. See <a href="http://isa99.isa.org/ISA99%20Wiki/Home.aspx" rel="nofollow ugc">http://isa99.isa.org/ISA99%20Wiki/Home.aspx</a>.</p>

				<p>For web servers with log-in, it is best to use HTTPS rather than HTTP to secure the connection.</p>
<p>However, it seems difficult to implement HTTPS on IoT, because it&#8217;s hard to maintain an up-to-date SSL certificate on IoT devices. A device-created self-signed certificate requires a user to either ignore browser warnings, or import a certificate into their browser. A manufacturer can&#8217;t really get signed certificates, because that depends on the device&#8217;s DNS name. A manufacturer could allow a user to load their own certificate, for those few users sophisticated enough to use that feature.</p>
<p>I guess a manufacturer needs to provide a gateway to the devices through their own web site, which can provide centralised HTTPS access, which also gets around IPv4 NAT and firewall issues.</p>

				<p>I think a strong argument can be made that IoT security is similar to public health &#8211; we want to prevent the general public from contracting infectious diseases in order to reduce the number of potential attack vectors capable of compromising individual health.</p>

				<p>Somebody should do statistical analysis of the listings as well as background checks on those organizations.<br />
How many of the listings are coming from the exact same organizations?  Do they have a good background and track record of being reliable and law-abiding and free of controversey or malignant behaviors?</p>
<p>Again, who are the players most trying to shove the IoT down our collective throats?<br />
We the people, really need to know.</p>
