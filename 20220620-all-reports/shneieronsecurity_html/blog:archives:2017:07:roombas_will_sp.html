		<p>The company that sells the Roomba autonomous vacuum wants to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/roombas-next-big-step-is-selling-maps-of-your-home-to-t-1797187829">sell</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/technology/roomba-irobot-data-privacy.html">the data</a> about your home that it collects.</p>
<p>Some questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>What happens if a Roomba user consents to the data collection and later sells his or her home &#8212; especially furnished &#8212; and now the buyers of the data have a map of a home that belongs to someone who didn&#8217;t consent, Mr. Gidari asked. How long is the data kept? If the house burns down, can the insurance company obtain the data and use it to identify possible causes? Can the police use it after a robbery?</p></blockquote>
<p>EDITED TO ADD (6/29): Roomba is <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/exclusive-roomba-ceo-responds-to-spying-story/">backtracking</a> &#8212; for now.</p>

				<p>i&#8217;m quite worried about this kind of things. and more in general worried about &#8220;the (mandatory) internet of things&#8221;<br />
i mean some things can be more useful if connected but noone sell you the server so you are locked with their cloud.<br />
not only! they make it mandatory, example: smart thermostat, if you aren&#8217;t connected it became useless, it stop work for no reason.</p>
<p>on pc and smartphone i have a firewall, &#8220;smart&#8221; tv is offline, but how can you stop that kind of things if they make it mandatory?</p>

				<p>Yes, the price of the device is enough. No, the vendor is not satisfied with being rich, s/he wants to be super-rich, a la Gates and Bezos. I believe in capitalism. Just not unfettered, step on anyone, anytime, anywhere, throw your weight around now that you&#8217;re a mega-hog cash hoarder capitalism. That kills people just as much as unfettered socialism. Our Congress Critters are <em>supposed</em> to lobby on our behalf against such abuses of cunning advantage.</p>
<p>But nooooooo&#8230;</p>

				<p>What data?  Floor plans are generally on file with the county assessor, and are public record.  I suppose they could tell how often you vacuum, and how much dirt is collected, and how much furniture you have, and how cluttered your floor is (though &#8220;has cluttered floors&#8221; and &#8220;having a robotic vacuum&#8221; appear to be incompatible sets, for multiple reasons).  Now, if the vacuum has a microphone, then the amount and value of data goes up exponentially, as does the evilness of adding data collection to a device that is not directly used to enhance the consumer experience.</p>

				<p>scot alexander, the new Roombas have cameras and laser sensors (lidar). They aren&#8217;t just mapping the floor plan, they&#8217;re seeing and mapping your furniture and potentially even when people use particular rooms. Aside from other concerns mentioned, imagine someone hacks that WiFi/Bluetooth-enabled camera that wanders throught your house. Imagine the police do that&#8230; without a warrant.</p>
<p>1984 was a cautionary tale, not an instruction manual.</p>

				<p>The reason that this kind of thing is troubling even though the information is technically available in various locations already is that it <em>isn&#8217;t</em> <i> available technically</i>  already.  It&#8217;s available if you hire 20,000 clerks to dig it out and assemble it.  This little plan makes it available for free by &#8220;stealing it&#8221; from your clients using their resources.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s similar to the difference between a computer vulnerability and the fact that most houses are poorly secured.  One guy in his mom&#8217;s basement can&#8217;t break into half the houses in the country at once.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what to call the fallacy in play, but just because there&#8217;s already another way something can be done doesn&#8217;t mean a new cheaper way to do it is of no concern.</p>
<p>Note that I&#8217;m only addressing the &#8220;floor plans&#8221; bit, not the previously-unavailable information on customer habit patterns and building occupancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Floor plans are generally on file with the county assessor, and are public record.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am curious as to what country your county assessors live in. Floor plans are not on file with in America, or at least not in my state (I&#8217;d hate to speak for all of America on this point).</p>

&#8220;It&#8217;s similar to the difference between a computer vulnerability and the fact that most houses are poorly secured. One guy in his mom&#8217;s basement can&#8217;t break into half the houses in the country at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a business model waiting to be tried out on the dark web by that guy in his mom&#8217;s basement.</p>
<p>Imaging going to the site on TOR, and searching for &#8220;homes near&#8221; giving it some address, not yours of course.  It would come back with a list of addresses and a set of ratings, based on neighborhood affluence, publicly known info about owner, maybe Roomba data that can ascertain security information.</p>
<p>Then you can perhaps bid, perhaps &#8220;buy it now&#8221; for the &#8220;rights&#8221; to break into that house, as well as all of the accumulated intelligence about it, including floor plans, owners&#8217; habits, locations of prime valuables, etc.</p>
<p>Guy in mom&#8217;s basement gets your fee, you get a much more efficiently run, more lucrative heist, with the side benefit of being less likely to get caught.</p>
<p>Unless of course the guy in mom&#8217;s basement is really in the FBI, working with your local police department.</p>

				<p>@ phred14,</p>
<blockquote><p>Unless of course the guy in mom&#8217;s basement is really in the FBI, working with your local police department.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is another service the guy in the basement could off which is &#8220;clean up&#8221; prior to CSI&#8217;s collecting evidence.</p>
<p>I will admit that in a way the idea is not new. There is an episode of NCIS where a little robot cleaning device &#8220;cleans up&#8221; the shell casings, or as some put it &#8220;Police the Brass&#8221;.</p>
<p>As it happens men generaly do not make good burglars, they tend to grab what they see and take little care to hide their presence, including often not wearing gloves or eating or drinking, thus leaving thei DNA all over the place, nice and fresh for CSI collection.</p>
<p>Some women burglers however go about things differently. They make quite covert entry and take care to not just wear gloves, but also hide their identity just in case of hidden CCTV. They also take care to not take anything obvious and not to leave things out of place.</p>
<p>This way the occupiers may not know they have been burgled for some time or at all. By which time trace evidence has been obliterated by normal household activities. It also makes off-loading or fencing the items easier as they have not been reported missing thus there is no stolen goods warning about them&#8230; A cleaning robot could easily be made to follow in a humans footsteps thus destroying evidence such as shoe impressions etc.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t see this as a big issue, since the Wi-Fi signals have been used for years to map (and monitor) houses on the inside. I agree the privacy issue needs to be addressed, but as long as we broadcast Wi-Fi throughout our houses, maps can be obtained surreptitiously and without a middleman.</p>

				<p>LOL,</p>
<p>At least this discussion isn&#8217;t, as yet, mired in minutia. Roomba, like other IoTs, is &#8216;on&#8217; even though it&#8217;s sitting quietly in its charging dock.</p>
<p>Look, if a device:</p>
<ol>
<li>Has sensors,</li>
<li>Has an Internet connection,</li>
</ol>
<p>Then it can be monetized or abused.</p>
<p>In my book, monetization -is- abuse, as is data collection by any gov&#8217;t agency.</p>
<p>Note to Roomba users: You may want to stop having sex on the floor. If you use the same location every time, Roomba may avoid that area, noting that it is something soft, and human-sized.</p>
<p>. .. . .. &#8212; &#8230;.</p>

<p>You are apparently discussing the (unmade) proposal to make house floor plans publicly available on the internet, not the current news of a company selling plans of their customers&#8217; houses.  Perhaps I failed to make my point.  I was trying to say that the argument &#8220;if something can be done somehow already, doing it another way is of no concern&#8221; is specious, not make any statement about what information should be available freely.</p>

<p>No, selling stuff to a criminal does NOT generally make you an accessory.</p>
<p>If you beat someone&#8217;s head in with a hammer, the hardware store that sold you the hammer is not an accessory.</p>
<p>If you write a letter to someone in order to blackmail them, the guys who sold you the pen, paper, envelope, and stamp are in the clear.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t normally have a duty to police others or actively prevent their crimes.</p>
<p>Now, if someone provided you with some tools with the <strong>intention</strong> of helping you commit a crime, then they&#8217;re probably culpable.  The difference is the &#8220;mens rea&#8221; (guilty mind) of the person providing the stuff.</p>
<p><a href="http://lawcomic.net/guide/?p=173" rel="nofollow ugc">http://lawcomic.net/guide/?p=173</a></p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re just selling stuff that might-or-might-not be used for a crime, that&#8217;s generally fine.</p>

<p>I see comments like this often, and don&#8217;t understand where they&#8217;re coming from. Cable television began as Community Antenna TeleVision (CATV) and was, conceptually, little more than a big antenna and a splitter. It didn&#8217;t give you anything you couldn&#8217;t get, in theory, for free—if you found a site not blocked by mountains etc. and set up an antenna. If the stations being captured and rebroadcast had commercials, the clients would get them too.</p>

<blockquote><p>Meanwhile the military continues to develop and deploy their own version of IoTs that surveil entire populations from above and rain down terror wherever suspicion arises.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lisa Ling (the whistleblower) is right that the way many drones are used is without doubt an act of terrorism[1]. It is also an extremely cowardly one as well, and worse it is in the main compleatly unnecessary for military or intelligence purposes[2].</p>
<p>Thus it is an act of quite deliberate terrorism against people who have no way to defend themselves from it. Thus morally it is as indefensible as what went on in Abu Ghraib[3].</p>
<p>Whilst those who do it in their cowardly way think there is no &#8220;comeback&#8221;, there almost always is. Unfortunatly it is usually not they the MSM or the MIC that have to pay the price of their actions, but other innocent civilians or those at the bottom of the food chain.</p>
<p>But you need to see forward to where this is going to go, traditional terrorism, does not have to be one state terrorising the citizens of another state. No it applies equally as well to a state terrorising it&#8217;s own citizens. Thus you have to ask where this is going, not just in the immediate future but the near future. We already know that the US Government is giving the civilian guard labour as much millitary equipment as it can via grants and other cover tactics. You have to ask when the LEOs are going to get not just the drones but the hellfire missiles as well&#8230; And as we know if you give boys new toys they will play with them sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>[1] Terrorism has had a changing definition over time and quite deliberatly so for political reasons. Originaly it was carried out by a state against civilians and it&#8217;s purpose was the tyranical act of subjugation by violence and feer. In other words what you would expect of a tyrant, dictator or despot, through their guard labour be it the civilian law enforcment or military.</p>
<p>[2] Repeatadly killing civilians in large numbers because of &#8220;poor intelligence&#8221; is not exactly sensible or intelligent. Thus you have to assume either they are criminaly incompetent or the excuse of &#8220;poor intelligence&#8221; is a cover up. It is clear from what is known that the use of the drones is not covert but very much overt. Such deliberate behaviour is not of any intelligence value, because potential intelligence targets are warned, thus stay out of sight and do not use any surveillable method of communications. Leading to the conclusion that such overt behaviour is not for intelligence purposes, thus terrorism in the traditional sense is the next most likely conclusion.</p>
<p>[3] Modern examples from both sides would be what has been seen in Syria with helicoptors and barrel bombs which has drawn international condemnation. However the MSM fail to make clear the other side that by replacing the helicopter with a reaper drone, and the barrel with a hellfire missile it is not in reality any different. However in the MSM eyes some how it is magically different, because it&#8217;s high tech with vast proffit to be made from tax dollars etc.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;You have NO IDEA how lazy people are.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He was not quite right, they are mostly &#8220;intentionaly lazy&#8221; and will show seriously risky behaviour just for a &#8220;quick fix&#8221;.</p>
<p>But it gets worse, even when they know they are getting surveilled in intimate detail, they keep going for that &#8220;quick gratification&#8221; of the gimic. They think not about their longterm fate because &#8220;It&#8217;s never going to happen&#8221; to them. Even when it has happened to somebody close to them, they are different or special thus immune.</p>
<p>They are the sort of people that will whilst getting every gadget they can run up hugh credit card bills and other debt. Because &#8220;they can handle it&#8221;.</p>
<p>To say it is an addiction at least as bad as that to any drug is down playing it. Drug addiction carries a great deal of shame and self loathing. Going broke and loosing everything apparently does not for a great number of people.</p>
<p>They are the &#8220;Beads, baubles and gehaw today, bankruptcy, penury and destitution tommorow boom and busters&#8221;. Going through cycle after cycle of boom and bust on easy credit, untill the credit stops and they develop another addiction through trying to deal with that.</p>
<p>It is just one of many self sacrificial behavious that we see. They however see it as &#8220;The Great American Way&#8221; or similar trope to excuse their excess.</p>

				<p>one could easily setup a second WiFi at home for all things IoT, which is totally firewalled (or even completely offline)</p>
<p>you could use remote control while at home, but those devices would NOT be able to send any data outside the home (or only certain ones you&#8217;d like eg security cams)</p>

<p>We thought of that. The second WiFi is an IoT device, too! A customized (read subverted) device. Any questions?</p>

<p>it doesnt really matter what the device chatter will be, if there is NO physical connection to the internet &#8230; unless you assume that all wifi routers have a secret &#8216;talk to each other and route data&#8217; mode builtin</p>
<p>my point is as always that with some network trickery one can control the data (non-)flow quite effectively</p>

<p>Is that such a far-fetched assumption? We need to make sure that&#8217;s not the case.</p>
<blockquote><p>my point is as always that with some network trickery one can control the data (non-)flow quite effectively</p></blockquote>
<p>True, with a condition: network devices must be trusted to function as advertised. In other words, genetically speaking: the primitive building blocks of your security solution must be trust-worthy. Otherwise you&#8217;ll need to dig deep in this blog for discussions on how to operate when the hardware isn&#8217;t trustworthy.</p>

				<p>@ neil, Bong_SPMBS,</p>
<blockquote><p>unless you assume that all wifi routers have a secret &#8216;talk to each other and route data&#8217; mode builtin</p></blockquote>
<p>It depends on,</p>
<p>1, The router.<br />
2, The networks it has access to.</p>
<p>In the UK a number of Internet Service Providers (ISPs)have done some very strange things with their routers.</p>
<p>Amongst the moronic such as having a &#8220;help desk configuration port&#8221; with a default password on the Internet side of the routers they insist you use. They have some even stranger ideas which accounts for why they insist you use their router with the configuration back door.</p>
<p>One strange idea is to have the router in your house also act as a &#8220;Public WiFi Hot Spot&#8221; for their mobile customers and even some smart meters. That is they take the bandwidth that you are paying for and share it with whoever of their customers can access the router in your home behind your back&#8230;</p>
<p>Yup so you might be paying for 20MbS but they share it with their customers not you. This way they get to provision their global mobile network for free off of the paying residential customers.</p>
<p>So yes I would be cautious of just what your IoT can get upto if your neighbour has service through such an ISP&#8230;. You might think it&#8217;s issolated but you may need to think again&#8230;</p>

				<p>@all&#8230;</p>
<p>Would it make you feel better, if Roomba plans to roll out telemetry for performance improvement and quietly sell the collected telemetry data for anyone willing to pay for it?</p>
<p>You know, like how all applications, operating systems, IoT/WiFi enabled devices and even cars with SIM cards work. Most, if not all of them have cameras nowadays. Like computers, refrigerators, TVs, cars, etc. These cameras already monitor us to improve device performance in tandem with other collected data. And this telemetry data quietly makes its way to data brokers, or LEOs, without you knowing about the data sharing, a.k.a, selling. Yes, this data is anonymous and it is just coincidence, that you are receiving targeted and relevant ads via different means, such as snail-mail, email, websites, etc.</p>
<p>At least Roomba had been up front about selling this data. Thank you, but I&#8217;ll keep my canister vacuum&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>In the UK a number of Internet Service Providers (ISPs)have done some very strange things with their routers.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if the UK copied how it&#8217;s done in the US, it&#8217;s the other way around, or both of them came up with this horrible idea. Maybe this was suggested by the LEOs for monitoring customers on the go and not just at home.</p>
<p>In the US, all major ISPs have &#8220;Public WiFi Hot Spot&#8221; that isn&#8217;t really public. Accessing it requires UID/PWD and generally the bandwidth is limited via QoS.</p>
<p>This only works, if the customer opts for the ISP provided, free broadband WiFi router. I almost fell for this, when my Juniper SMB router with no support had became flaky. Picked up one of these free broadband router at the nearby service center that was the same brand and model # that was the candidate for replacement. It had become quite clear that I have no control of the router at all, it is only the tech support, that can make configuration changes. Two hours later, the free router was back at the service center.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve purchased a router that supports open-source software and never looked back&#8230;</p>

				<p>Under the new EU <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc">GDPR</a>, not only will collection, processing and further distribution of any such data be subject to explicit user consent, the user will also at any time have the right to revoke his consent as well as consult, modify and even delete such data (&#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221;). Maximum fines for non-compliance range from 4% of the company’s annual global revenue, or €20 million, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>I am currently looking into teaming up with a local law firm to offer both GDPR-compliance consultancy services (legal, HR, IT, and business processes), as well as a legal service to sue out of existence any IoT or other non-compliant mofos on behalf of customers whose privacy and data protection rights are being violated. It&#8217;s gonna be easy money, and beats the hell out of real work 😎</p>
<p>Just a small example: consumer electronics product developer Vizio was recently <a href="https://www.scmagazineuk.com/vizio-fined-by-us-authority-for-unauthorised-data-collection-from-tvs/article/636558/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc">fined $2.2 million</a> after the US consumer watchdog found that it had been using content recognition software to track users without obtaining their permission. Under the GDPR, Vizio (now part of LeEco, a Chinese company worth $7.3 billion revenue) risks similar privacy issues and as from May 28th 2018 will be exposed to a fine of $292 million.</p>

<p>That would be interesting, if I&#8217;d have Roomba stocks, but I don&#8217;t. In my view, there&#8217;s a correlation between stock prices and telemetry collection, at least in the case of Microsoft and probably others as well. I am looking at you Google&#8230;</p>
<p>MSFT stock price hovered around mid-thirty bucks from mid-2000 to early 2014, when the preview version of Windows 10, had became available with its extensive telemetry that had been retrofitted to Windows 7 and 8.x. Ever since then the stock price shows relatively steep upward trend, currently at $74.04. Not too bad for about three years time frame, after being stagnant for over a decade.</p>
<p>Certainly, there are other aspects that contributed to doubling the stock price, in addition to the extensive telemetry collection from the desktop with the largest market share. And no, I don&#8217;t own Microsoft, Google, Apple and other software/service companies. On the other hand I do own IT hardware manufacturers stocks&#8230;.</p>

<p>Zero percent. It will come <b>on top</b> of the earlier mentioned administrative fines payable to the supervising authority as data subjects will indeed have &#8220;the right to receive compensation&#8221; from either a data controller or data processor if they have &#8220;suffered material or immaterial damage as a result of an infringement of the Regulation&#8221;. The level of punitive damages awarded to a data subject would of course depend on the nature and severity of the damage incurred and as demonstrated by his/her evil attorney(s) in a court of law. And yes, quite some EU countries have the equivalent of the US class action suit. It&#8217;s gonna be B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L !</p>
<p>In the case of the recent IT scandal in Sweden, it would mean that pretty much every Swede could sue both IBM and the Swedish government.</p>

				<p>As nobody else presents that position, I will do it, albeit largely (but not exclusively) for the sake of balance.</p>
<p>We are living in a strange triangular world.</p>
<p>On one side there is politics telling us about all the wonderful rights we have, how hard each and every politician (except, of course, those from the other party) works to protect and even enhance the wonderful rights we have.</p>
<p>On the second side there is media, advertising, and pr. They tell us how wonderful we are, how smart, how individual, and how we are the center the unviverse.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the third side, reality. Reality is usually quite quiet but the only side that really counts.<br />
Reality, when asked, tells us things like: &#8220;Rights? F*ck you! You have no rights vs. a government that wanton gags you with e.g. nsl. You have no rights vs. a large corp unless you are able to spend no less millions on lawyers than they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, of course, is asked, reality would also tell us this: <em>You</em> have created a society whose only god is mammon and in which almost everyone would be just as criminal and ignorant as roomba if only you ever were in their shoes.<br />
You <em>know</em> that there is a plethora of problems and pretty much security whatsoever in all those funny new devices &#8211; yet you buy them, you bring them into your house, you activate them.</p>
<p>Expecting that roomba will honour and protect your privacy is about as smart as telling a falling bomb about your rights.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in Oklahoma, one of the least-funded, most paranoid, bible-thumping, gun-toting states there is, and at least partial floor plans are certainly available here.  For example, here&#8217;s a house that I know is currently up for sale:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.assessor.tulsacounty.org/assessor-property.php?account=R71040832710990&#038;go=1" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.assessor.tulsacounty.org/assessor-property.php?account=R71040832710990&#038;go=1</a></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a random house from Vermont, which is about as politically diametrically opposed as you can get:  <a href="https://property.burlingtonvt.gov/PropertyDetails.aspx?a=580" rel="nofollow ugc">https://property.burlingtonvt.gov/PropertyDetails.aspx?a=580</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure more detailed records are available if you go looking for building permits, previous sales listings, etc.  Certainly enough to pinpoint, say, the master bedroom precisely enough to drop a weaponized drone into it.</p>

<p>That is true for virtually every type of electronic device you have in your home. Especially the security stuff like CCTV and locks and alarm pannels&#8230;</p>
<p>Back in the early 1980&#8217;s I was at a conferance about Domestic Wide Area  Networking, where a question came up about the extension of what we would now call &#8220;The Internet coffee pot&#8221;. A discussion developed about what a boon it would be to housewives &#8211;I kid you not&#8211; and how they could get a recipie at the touch of a button where it would be based on all the food you had in the larder and fridge&#8230;</p>
<p>What we&#8217;ve got is worse, 50&#8243; plasma displays that watch you watching your p0rn, or pouring the beer or natchoes all over the floor because you had forgotton yould put them down by your feet befor you lumbered up to go use the facilities&#8230;</p>

292 million is only 4% of 7.3 billion.  Greedy as they are, that still amounts to a slap on the wrist. How much do they make selling the ill-gotten data? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to know. Nonetheless, I hope the laws work. They are sorely needed.<br />
..<br />
Samsung is marketing a new refrigerator with a large screen that lets you enter your shopping list, then read it on your smartphone when you&#8217;re shopping. Easy peasey.  I literally LOL&#8217;d when I first saw the TV commercial.<br />
..<br />
Many years ago (ca 1992), I received a new model razor in the mail. It was a 2-blade version being marketed at the time. I had been using the old double-edged blades in a 1940&#8217;s razor. All brand G______ needed was my address (credit card) and data from the store (my shaving purchases) and bingo, I was a possible convert to the new tech.  Best marketing ploy I&#8217;ve ever seen.<br />

<p>unfortunately we (as a security weary minority) can not control anymore (ha &#8211; did we ever?) what kind of devices are being pushed onto consumers, we will be forced to &#8216;live with it&#8217; (or &#8216;live with IoT&#8217;)</p>
<p>so unless you go back to wax candles and no electricity in your home you&#8217;re screwed</p>
<p>but we still have (some) control over our networks &#8230; in the end you&#8217;ll have to trust someone, be it cisco, juniper or dd-wrt &#8230; you can still setup your own firewall and airsnort to check</p>
<p>(i know even that can be manipulated)</p>

<p><i>292 million is only 4% of 7.3 billion.</i></p>
<p>It was initially more, but got watered down due to powerful lobbying by the usual suspects. But let&#8217;s not forget that it&#8217;s 4% on revenue, not on profits, and that it can grow significantly more as a result of additional law suits brought forth by corporate and/or private data subjects. Which means that the total amount due in fines and punitive damages may still end up being so huge that no board can possibly justify it to its shareholders.</p>

				<p>My Roomba is holding my bitcoins for ransom.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious, you need a treecam to watch your Roomba. Police state the police state. Fight back. You don&#8217;t know what Roomba does when you&#8217;re gone or sleeping.</p>
<p>Oh.. and&#8230; stop buying IoT devices. It&#8217;s materialistic waste. I don&#8217;t need a special watch to tell me how fat I am and send my gps tracking to complete strangers. Don&#8217;t use security cams with half-baked opensource projects like gSOAP.</p>

				<p>Interesting point from Clive there. I has been under the impression that buying a device but then &#8216;forgetting&#8217; to connect it to a network would be enough. If the device still works OK, then good. If it doesn&#8217;t work without a connection, then return the product.<br />
But now I&#8217;m taking note of Clive&#8217;s observation that the device could quietly  connect itself using its own userIDs to any convenient public WiFi. Not using my network at all. Then we&#8217;re talking about removing antennae cables, or maybe even setting up networks which broadcast the spoofed SSID of a public WiFi, but which have no working connection.<br />
Or just configure the device with the wrong house address and a mis-spelt owner&#8217;s name. It would be entertaining to watch the housebreaker attack next door and bump into all the walls.</p>

Under the new EU GDPR, not only will collection, processing and further distribution of any such data [!]be subject to explicit user consent[!], the [!]user will also at any time have the right to revoke his consent as well as consult, modify and even delete such data (&#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221;)[!].</p>
<p>Dirk, thank you for that information. Europe basically is going into right direction on privacy &#8211; practice good to follow. User should be put in charge, not corporation. Unfortunately, for now the only federal structure moving in such direction (no so fast as desired) is CFPrB, but FTC and FCC are silent on that issue. Lobby for big business will do everything to prevent legislature adopt laws which will implement ideas in your post. That is bitter reality.</p>

<p>They sure will, and already have big time, but any US (5Eyes, Chinese, Russian or Arab) company that wants to continue doing business with the EU will have to comply too, whether they want it or not. And since the GDPR is not a directive, but a regulation, it will take effect as is, i.e. without any modifications to member state legislation required.</p>
<p>There is little doubt in my mind that some US companies will try to hide behind the controversial Privacy Shield with regards to data transfers, but I&#8217;m reasonably sure that it is just a matter of time before the ECJ strikes it down just like it did its Safe Harbour predecessor.</p>

				<p>So, is there a CALEA compliance stamp somewhere on this device? Ima little fuzzy on the whole &#8220;backdoor every NIC with no handshake protocol&#8221; thing.</p>
<p>A future consumer dotCloud blowout. A statistical expected curve off from obvious failure or market saturation. These companies die because no amount of privacy invasion for market research will save from ego and desperation.</p>

<p>clive has a good point there indeed, you never know what a device is really up-to unless you watch it &#8230;. alike &#8220;secret life of dogs&#8221;</p>
<p>hence my suggestion to use eg airsnort to watch what&#8217;s going thru &#8230; even that could be maipulated to NOT show the intel packets</p>
<p>unless you hook it up to an oscilloscope and match the air packets loged with their time of arrival on the scope</p>
<p>but again, the biggest risk to the user is still WPS, UPNP, some forgotten TELNET developer installed backdoor, &#8230;</p>
<p>maybe we should burden the WiFi router makers more with prooving (and keeping) their devices are safe, instead of bashing IoT device makers &#8211; they wont do since their margins are too small to pay for it</p>

<p>Roombas are sharing more than just data about our homes.</p>
<p>On a more serious note, it is sad these devices are collecting data about our homes and sharing it with the manufacturer.  These devices are expensive enough as to make this &#8220;alternative business model&#8221; completely unaceptable, not to say they have enough computing power to store any data they need to do its work locally.</p>

<p>I agree.  It will be beautiful.  Information should be under control of those who emit it and, on the wild Internet, it usually means people, not corporations.</p>
<p>U.S. Corporations tend to ignore values as privacy or constitutional rights (not only the rights of foreigners but also their own citizens ones) but I have serious doubts they will ignore the huge amount of money it will cost to them violating the most basic rights of E.U. citizens.</p>
<p>I hope some day the United States will develop a similar law to protect their own citizens from the abuse of these corporations.</p>

				<p>@who?</p>
<p>thanks for the link, even though it added even more horror to all concerns about roombas</p>
<p>many people i have talked to oppose data collections (win10, roomba etc) but when they read PR like &#8221; &#8230; we are collecting data to improve our products &#8230;&#8221; they sighed and allowed that to continue &#8221; &#8230; if it really helps to make XYZ better &#8230; then i&#8217;m OK with it &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>the cause IMHO is user complacency with 20+ page EULAs where collection is allowed by clicking on &#8220;i agree&#8221;, and the urge to always find the cheapest product (=amazon growth) that squeezes margins so much that the developers (have to) give up thorough product development</p>

<p>Sounds good, that about the new EU regulations. Exactly what I&#8217;ve been saying for the past few years. nice to see I&#8217;m not alone.</p>
<p>Next thing is to get personal information recognized as being under copyright.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen in drawn-out Kim DotCom case in New Zealand and US courts, copyright infringement is now considered a major criminal offense in US courts. I would dearly love to break up a US company or two for copyright infringement for taking personal information submitted in good faith to their New Zealand representatives, selling it to the second company for advertising purposes, and then angering and frightening my mother by sending her advertising.</p>
<p>Personal data aka private information is generated by a person; it is unique to that person, thus fulfilling a major part of modern copyright law eg it expresses the unique identity of that individual; so since copyright infringement is now considered a criminal offense &#8211; according to the RIAA director during the 2000s, it is a worse offense than terrorism &#8211; so lets break up comanies left right and centre for copyright infringement, let&#8217;s jail their boards of directors for knowingly and criminally infringing customers&#8217; copyrights. Etc.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do an RIAA on the RIAA itself. Ditto the MPAA &#8230; any more I should add?</p>

				<p>@JG4,</p>
<p>From the squid thread&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Roombas have been mapping your homes for years&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not like blueprints of houses, or that satellite high res pictures of houses (alongside cars and humans that happen to be present in the driveway or backyard) aren&#8217;t readily available[1]. What could Roombas possibly discover? How a couch, a chair, and a fridge are arranged? The texture of the carpet, or how dirty or clean the house is? What&#8217;s the real purpose?</p>
<p><b>Product developer:</b> We have this new feature to map houses!<br />
<b>VP of products:</b> What are we going to do with it, and how will we monetize that? What&#8217;s the ROI?<br />
<b>Product developer:</b> We&#8217;ll add the capability, put the data in the cloud, and expose a RESTful API that application developers may utilize!<br />
<b>VP of products:</b> Great idea, get on it. We can advertise things based on what we discover at the house! Suggest a new carpet or carpet cleaner, reccomend dandruff shampoo for the pets, analyze skin samples and categorize insects collected! Yea! We can get a cut on selling insecticide, too! We can also, based on topology, suggest rearrangement of house furniture and even reccomended an interior designer to remodel the house for efficiency!<br />
<b>Product developer:</b> We can also grant access to this data to spook agencies (hint, hint &#8211; wink, wink.)<br />
<b>VP of products:</b> You&#8217;re a genius! Just make sure the one I have at my house isn&#8217;t sending data, or I&#8217;ll can your *ss.<br />
<b>Product developer:</b> Recreationsl drugs, boss?<br />
<b>VP of products:</b> I want one of the older models that don&#8217;t collect data.</p>
<p>I have a better idea! Add some sensors to Roombas to detect the type of garbage it collects, and see if there are any &#8216;illegal drugs&#8217; or explosive traces collected. Then send a trigger to LE, especially if the person is about to travel.</p>
<p>[1] A few years ago I searched for my house address on real estate satellite images. I saw my house, my car in the driveway and a couple of pets in the image.</p>

				<p>In connection with my previous comments on personal data and the like, I just remembered that if I am proved right that personal data is under copyright &#8211; and we&#8217;re half-way there with the regulation that personal data is personally owned data, not corporately-owned data &#8211; then the world-famous Acne Corp so beloved of Wiley Coyote and the Roadrunners, will have to wait 50 to 70 years after I&#8217;m dead before they can safely use my data without consulting me. How they are to consult me after I&#8217;m dead, I&#8217;ll leave it up to the imagination. Feel free &#8230;</p>
<p>And also, there may be other charges one might lay against errant corporations &#8230; full responsibility for taking care of the data that is after all, only entrusted to them and them alone. What happens when a company does not exercise due care and some lout of a script-kiddie phishes that data out and my private property gets burgled or something of that sort?</p>
<p>Fun and games, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s what.</p>

				<p>@ Wesley Parish,</p>
<blockquote><p>I just remembered that if I am proved right that personal data is under copyright</p></blockquote>
<p>It depends in general if it&#8217;s an &#8220;act of art/work&#8221; or not. For instance you do not have copyright on your street address or telephone number, they belong to others such as the local municipality, post office and phone provider. Unless you change your name by deed pole or for the purposes of trade you do not have copyright on your name (but your parents might argue successfully that they do).</p>
<p>You do however have copyright on your house name if you give it one or rename it with a different one. However it would have to be &#8220;original&#8221; the old retirment name of &#8220;Dunroming&#8221; is by no means original.</p>
<p>The fly in the ointment is derived works. If I have an accurate list of streetnames I probably do not have copyright on it. If however you slip a couple of false ones in or even leave some out it becomes a derived work, thus copyright can be established.</p>
<p>Now an odd one, if you fill a form in by hand you actually have created a work and thus have copyright on the form. However if someone takes the form and types what you have written in to a computer then that is a derived work in it&#8217;s own right.</p>
<p>In the US for instance the law in effect says that the data belongs to who ever collects it. In Europe to prevent this there is data protection legislation.</p>
<p>Of course none of the above realy matters, because you will almost always find some place in the world where there is either no applicable legislation or the legislation there is has more holes than a string vest. Then of course there is the likes of the USA where an organisation with deep pockets and a smart mouthed lawyer can in effect by the result they want, by the simple tactic of spending more money than you can&#8230;</p>
<p>And that is the point when it comes to those that make money by &#8220;Rent Seeking&#8221; most people can not aford to fight them, so they get away with theft of copyright.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t like Roombas.  We used to have one, and it would always seem to go where I was sitting, rather than to some unoccupied part of the room.</p>
<p>But even if I did want one, I don&#8217;t need a &#8220;connected&#8221; or &#8220;smart&#8221; one.  The claimed benefit of the mapping of your house, so that it can more smartly clean your house, doesn&#8217;t require that the device be connected to any network; that functionality can all be handled locally in the device itself.  I could leave an SD card plugged into my Roomba, and all the mapping info would be stored only on the SD card.  Then, if I get a new Roomba, or otherwise dispose of the old one, I can remove the SD card, and only I then have the information.  I can then insert that same SD card into the new Roomba, and it will have all of the mapping info for my house.</p>
<p>But then iRobot couldn&#8217;t spy on me and sell the information, so I doubt it will ever happen.</p>

				<p>On a security blog, everyone will be super sensitive on security. In this case, too sensitive. The Roomba cameras look up, so only useful to chandelier theives. It can&#8217;t see furniture until it&#8217;s under it. Floor plan? Every house on my block has the same one. The crooks don&#8217;t care. Until it sniffs my wifi or sprouts a microphone, there are a million things more sinister than my automatic vacuums.</p>
