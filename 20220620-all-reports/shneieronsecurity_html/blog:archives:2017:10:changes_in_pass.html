		<h2 class="entry">Changes in Password Best Practices</h2>
		<p>NIST recently published its four-volume <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63b.pdf"><i>SP800-63b Digital Identity Guidelines</i></a>. Among other things, it makes three important suggestions when it comes to passwords:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop it with the annoying password complexity rules. They make passwords harder to remember. They increase errors because artificially complex passwords are harder to type in. And they <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-man-who-wrote-those-password-rules-has-a-new-tip-n3v-r-m1-d-1502124118">don&#8217;t help</a> that much. It&#8217;s better to allow people to use pass phrases.
<li>Stop it with password expiration. That was an <a href="https://securingthehuman.sans.org/blog/2017/03/23/time-for-password-expiration-to-die">old idea for an old way</a> we used computers. Today, don&#8217;t make people change their passwords unless there&#8217;s indication of compromise.
<li>Let people use password managers. This is how we deal with all the passwords we need.</ol>
<p>These password rules were failed attempts to <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7676198/?reload=true">fix the user</a>. Better we fix the security systems.</p>

				<p>I agree basically, but doesn&#8217;t 3) kinda make 1) and 2) obsolete? If I use a pw manager and don&#8217;t have to remember them, don&#8217;t complex rules or auto generated passwords with high complexity actually do make them more secure?</p>
<p>1) is in place because people cannot remember complex passwords and reuse the same over multiple accounts.</p>
<p>So &#8230; if you use a pw manager, do use complex passwords.</p>

				<p>I agree with #1 and #3, but not #2. How often do people check if their passwords were compromised on sites like Troy Hunt&#8217;s HIPB? Sure we are supposed to have unique passwords for every application&#8230;we dont though (as a whole)&#8230;so either we have to constantly check if the login information has been compromised or they need to get cycled out after a predefined time. Using a PW manager and forcing them to expire is best.</p>

				<p>Brian: I think that using a passwort manager does not automatically make 1) and 2) obsolete.</p>
<p>Of course, you can use a password manager to create complex passwords that match all the complexity rules that we are trying to get rid off. On the other hand, you can also use a password manager as pure convenience for people who do not want to remember 30 different passphrases and, at the same time, throw away all the complexity rules.</p>
<p>Of course, password managers make it easy for you to choose another password every 90 days. On the other hand, why would you have to choose another password every 90 days? It is tremendously annoying, even if you &#8220;only&#8221; have to generate a new password from your PW manager. You don&#8217;t win the users&#8217; sympathy if you annoy them all the time. 😉</p>

				<p>Sean: I think you are right for a specific use case. However, most of my customers have a very simple algorithm for changing their passwords every x days: they choose a word, some special character and place a number at the end. When the system tells them to change their password, they increase the number and repeat that every time the system tells them to change the password. In a large organization, the tech guys should look after the database where the passwords are stored and act accordingly. If a user thinks that his or her password was compromised, they should report this as an incident. If a user willingly gives their password away, they will probably give their password away after it has been changed. So there is no added security by frequently changing passwords assuming that you have proper monitoring in place.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m ok with complex passwords, because I rarely type them.  As a 1Password user, #2 is generally taken care of for me, as well.  Their watchtower feature locally compares the URL of your password items, the date you last changed a password, and a list of known compromises.</p>

				</p>

				<p>NIST also recommends to prevent the use of “well known” (weak) passwords, i.e. checking against potentially long lists before accepting a password.</p>
<p>Without this compensating control, these measures will likely increase the risks associated with weak/insecure password use.</p>
<p>No word yet from major vendors if/how/when this may become available as a built-in feature.</p>

				<p>The problem with changing password often is not just that we have to remember passwords, but also that there needs to be a process to change passwords, which becomes a prime target for users.</p>
<p>If you can convince one user to change a password using the wrong tool, you&#8217;re in. And if that user is regularly harassed about changing his password, and sufficiently annoyed by it, you may have a really good opportunity to steal his password (the old and the new).</p>

				<p>The &#8220;use a pw manager&#8221; needs to be accompanied with &#8220;don&#8217;t set up your damned website to make it impossible to paste a password in from a pw manager&#8221;</p>
<p>And yes, some do. Idiots. Which causes problems when a pw has &#8220;lower case ell vs numeral one&#8221; and &#8220;capital oh vs numeral zero&#8221; type characters that can be tough (in a font-dependent way) to distinguish on a computer screen, in order to manually type into a password box.</p>
<p>The websites that overly java-ize web pages are the worst for this.</p>

				<p>@Brian:</p>
<p>The problem with complexity rules isn&#8217;t just that they&#8217;re annoying for humans: if you use a password manager to generate your passwords, it doesn&#8217;t know the stupid, finicky rules required by the host. Much better if the manager can just spit out 16 or 20 characters of ASCII-printable noise, especially since we now know that these rules tend to cause humans to generate bad passwords rather than good ones.</p>
<p>Periodic rotation of passwords might have been useful in the days when attacks most likely had an in-person component and it was possible that there could be a significant time lapse between when the adversary learned your password and was actually able to exploit it. These days that time gap only happens if users reuse passwords, which (1) actually made more common, or the host itself is compromised, which password rotation doesn&#8217;t solve. The threat model that rotating passwords protects against has gotten very convoluted, so we&#8217;re better off without.</p>
<p>Besides which, some people (due to techphobia or paranoia) still aren&#8217;t using and may never use password managers, so you have to account for that section of the user base as well.</p>

				<p>The problem with pw managers is they assume the user is using the same personal device all the time. There are those of us who job requires the use of many terminals so passwords must be typed in on every use.<br />
Add in a mandatory change every six weeks and the IT security knobs earn all the derision they get.</p>

				<ol>
<li><b>Stop it with the annoying password complexity rules:</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Then prepare to handle passwords like: password1234 and 00000000</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Stop it with password expiration. [&#8230;] change their passwords unless there&#8217;s indication of compromise.</b></li>
<ul>
<li>The part about changing passwords when there are indications of pw compromise is sensible, assuming our detection of compromise methods are good.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I still have not seen a scientific objective research in this area that concludes changing a password on a periodic basis is superior to leaving the password unchanged. Or vice versa. To reach a conclusion without the supporting evidence is just claims supported by heuristic arguments; hardly a convincing claim. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/08/frequent_passwo.html#c6730497" rel="nofollow ugc">Treat the topic from a probabilistic</a> perspective and make the calculations! One day, I will if no one in the academia is willing to treat this matter. Problem is I don&#8217;t have the bandwidth. This could be a good dissertation topic in applied math or something&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Let people use password managers.</b></li>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Encourage&#8221; is a more suitable verb, as no one has prevented humans from using password managers, or passphrase managers </li>
</ul>

<p>&#8220;This is DESPITE the fact that any reasonable analysis shows that a monthly password change has little or no end impact on improving security!    It is a “best practice” based on experience 30 years ago with non-networked mainframes in a DoD environment—hardly a match for today’s systems, especially in academia!&#8221;</p>
<p>Since he wrote that in 2006, make that 40 years ago.</p>

				<p>Interesting that Bitlocker password has a upper limit of 20 characters, and defaults to AES-128. It has to be configured thru GP to AES-256 (search for &#8220;Choose drive encryption method and cipher strength&#8221;) before drive encryption. Also, password is limited to A-Z, 0-9 unless &#8220;Allow enhanced PINs for startup&#8221; is set&#8230;</p>
<p>If I was cynical, I&#8217;d be a-wondering&#8230;</p>

				<p>100% agree with the suggestions, especially #1.</p>
<p>Replace those pointless password rules with a minimum entropy check. My password manager can generate all-lowercase passphrases (handy if you have to manually enter them on a phone or with a remote control, since there&#8217;s no shifting) with hundreds of bits of entropy, only to have it rejected by a form that requires &#8220;at least 8 characters, at least one uppercase, at least one symbol, and an emoji, but only on alternate tuesdays&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote><p>These password rules were failed attempts to fix the user. Better we fix the security systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>The reason the old rules came about was actually more to do with making the best of very limited resources, rather than fix the user.</p>
<p>I can remember when there were no mobile phones and 8bit computer chips would be the equivalent of $1000 in todays money and RAM was up at nearly a $1/nibble. That was some years before the first 10MByte hard drives came about (yes I realy do mean 1048576 bytes of RAM).</p>
<p>It was only years later these rules &#8220;supposadly&#8221; were to fix the user, by which time they had developed as a cultural myth and people were trying to explain them. Kind of handed down like &#8220;Grandfathers hamner&#8221;.</p>
<p>I guess people realy do not understand just how resource constrained the early 1980&#8217;s and earlier computing realy was.</p>

				<p>It make sense to change passwords for <em>important logins</em> after some time period like 30 days. Look at Linkedin, Dropbox, Yahoo: the data breaches happened years ago, but the company and the public knew it first years later.<br />
With a password manager it&#8217;s easy to change from a strong password to a new strong password and it&#8217;s not time-consuming.</p>

				<p>Hmm, I always thought we need to replace passwords and while password managers aren&#8217;t really replacing the password they do a good job because you can make passwords as absurd as possible &#8211; if the companies don&#8217;t derp and restrict what you can use as a password. And 2FA should be mandatory (even if we still need to fix some issues like SMS codes).</p>
<p>I also think we should stop using e-mails as usernames to access our e-mails for instance. I mean, if an attacker doesn&#8217;t know what is the id to access one account we have added security. I honestly don&#8217;t know how to deal with it without impacting usability (as in, without adding yet another thing for our brains to remember).</p>

				<p>Observations:<br />
1. Length trumps complexity. A 17-character or longer pass phrase is better than a shorter but more complex password.<br />
2. Password policy&#8230;and more specifically&#8230;password expiration should be risk-informed. In general, I agree that requiring change only on indication of compromise is better than arbitrary changes. But requiring changes on a scheduled basis for more risky systems is still a good idea; and the periodicity of those changes should be commensurate with the risk; for example, privileged accounts should have a check-in/check-out/one-time-use only.<br />
3. Password managers are only a good idea if they are used with reasonable due care, and that brings us right back to the stupid user problem.</p>

				<p>Much more important would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implement decent two factor.</li>
</ol>
<p>By which I mean, NOT biometrics or mobile phone applications.  These are terrible from the consumer point of view, which is why so many websites &#8211; if they do have two factor &#8211; are switching to them:- they just LOVE owning your fingerprints/mobile phone because they can spy on you and claim your identity (probably so they can pass on financial liability to you ultimately).</p>
<p>That there is a cheap passive dongle available in U2F which is far better from a privacy point of view, which is presumably why websites rarely support it.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve wondered if it&#8217;s worthwhile to have a password expiration, but measure it in years. Must change password every 2-3 years or something. The idea being that abandoned accounts eventually can&#8217;t login without a reset, thus if a properly secured password hash has been compromised, it would be locked or reset long before it could be used.</p>

				<p>Most people have a very tiny handful of accounts that they login to on a fairly frequent basis. Having to lookup the passwords for those accounts will rapidly become an exercise in frustration. It is also at least relatively common for a person to need to already be logged into a frequently used account/device before they can actually access their password manager. Put these observations together and it seems to me that the passwords to one&#8217;s most common accounts should be at least reasonably easy to remember and to type in. Also, there would not seem to be any inherent conflict between rule 1 (stop it with the annoying password complexity rules) and 2 (use a password manager).</p>

				<p>I hesitate to respond to &#8220;everybody change your password,&#8221; because it can be used to stimulate traffic to a decoy site, and gather passwords.  We usually get notified long after the incident.  I reason that, waiting a few days for any decoy to be discovered, then changing my password, doesn&#8217;t widen the risk window substantially.</p>
<p>Add to that, we&#8217;ve all been exposed anyway.  It&#8217;s just a matter of when we get the next report of another spill.</p>

				<p>Be helpful if websites allowed the use of non-printable characters in passwords&#8230;  Makes the brute force replacement attack take substantially longer.

				<p>For any account even remotely sensitive password expiration, while distasteful, is still valid. Password reuse across accounts is a fact of life. Breaches of 3rd party account databases and password dumps are also a fact of life. Data theft and attacks of all sort using those credentials are a fact of life. There are 2 mitigations available to me, MFA and password expiration. MFA is not always possible technically or politically. Unfortunately, that only leaves me with password expiration.</p>

				<p>The &#8216;use a password manager&#8217; thing just turns the problem into &#8216;how does the person authenticate to the password manager?&#8217;, because it had better be with a pretty good password.

<p>So why not put a Federal bounty out &#8211; if you can catch a company not protecting user data, you get $100 per unsecured identity you uncover when you report them to the FCC/Fx?</p>
<p>The &#8220;free market&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work unless you set and enforce legal parameters.</p>

				<p>My favorites are the services which set a <em>maximum</em> password length (16 and 20 characters are common limitations). Since a hash is always a known length, I can&#8217;t think of any technical reason to limit password length unless you&#8217;re storing passwords in cleartext.  So the existence of that limitation probably advertises more about the site administrator&#8217;s security competence than they imagine.</p>

				<p>&#8221; Unfortunately, that only leaves me with password expiration. &#8221;</p>
<p>Why not 2-factor or 3-factor or 4-factor authentication that kicks in after a specified interval instead?</p>
<p>A password should only get you in the door, it shouldn&#8217;t by itself = an identity.</p>

				<p>Years ago, I also tired of the choices of password managers and wrote my own. It does not store passwords and &#8220;forces&#8221; folks to use different passwords for different sites. It also addresses the &#8220;security question&#8221; thingy. That is another irritant. Handled &#8220;normally&#8221;, you wind up with common questions and common answers and sometimes questions with answers that change. Ick. My password manager manages the answers for these, too. 🙂</p>

				<p>@Me</p>
<p>I agree that 16 or 20 characters is a very stupid limitation.</p>
<p>But one possible reason to have <em>some</em> limitation is bandwidth; transmitting an 8MB password to your server consumes resources even if you never <em>store</em> it on the server.</p>
<p>A possible counter to this is to hash the password client-side before transmitting it.  (Obviously, the server still needs to hash it AGAIN, and take all other security steps it would have taken if the client were not hashing the password. I mean having the client hash it <em>in addition</em>.)  I think this is probably a good option in many settings, although it comes with the downside that the server cannot enforce password policies (not even stuff like minimum length) except to compare against a blacklist.  (You can still try to enforce password policies on the client side, but those are easier for someone to compromise.)</p>
<p>If any security professionals would like to opine on the usefulness of client-side password hashing, I&#8217;d be interested to hear.</p>
<p>(To be more technically rigorous:  I am assuming that the client-side hash is completely deterministic, so that the user can log in from multiple devices without first synchronizing them.  But it contains the password, a constant unique to the app/service in question, and possibly the username.  The server still computes a salted hash (of the hash) as if it were receiving a plaintext password.)</p>

				<p>@Jeremy:</p>
<p>A sane password length to avoid 8MB issues is one thing. Limiting passwords to 20 characters is another.</p>
<p>Better than worrying about hashing a hash and how well that works out, just implement SRP &#8212; naturally only relevant if you are <em>providing</em> the service. For the rest of us, password managers are the way to go.</p>

				<p>For people asking if 3) overrides 1) and 2), no and yes.<br />
If you enforce a password policy, it narrows the range of characters required in brute force quite considerably by pointing out absolutes in a password.<br />
Even worse when you have banned characters!  That is such a dumb thing to do!<br />
If you allow pretty much any unicode character, it increases the character set to a silly number of calculations required to brute force even trivially small passwords, never mind sentence-long things, simply because the person trying to get your account cannot assume anything about the passwords structure.<br />
Not going to matter with site logins since 90% of the time it is dumb sysadmins not applying even BASIC security to their databases that get leaked (some don&#8217;t even <b>use</b> databases, mere plaintext files!), but encryption containers and such it matters very much.</p>
<p>2) is more of an annoyance that makes people create simpler passwords by proxy, not all times but most times.    So yes, it helps here.<br />
Even simple password generation schemes would help here.<br />
It&#8217;s not hard to create complex passwords that can&#8217;t be brute-forced or dictionary-attacked easily.  People just don&#8217;t want to think and remember sadly.<br />
So password managers are for this.  The more people use them, the better.  So many don&#8217;t take account security seriously.  The downside is cloud-synced password managers.  Even they have fallen prey to dumb security practices!</p>
<p>A popular albeit crazy idea suggested by some people is to prevent small passwords.  However, this also creates a situation where a potential cracker KNOWS this fact.  Minimum password size is 20 characters?  They no longer need to brute force or dictionary attack any passwords smaller than 20.  That eliminates a huge amount of effort for them.<br />
<b>Allow everything</b> and it makes their lives considerably harder.<br />
Limits are never a good thing in security.</p>
<p>Website security be damned, it never matters there because most times they use weak hashing methods with small hash sizes, making all of this pointless anyway!</p>

				<p>I just say it flat out: I don&#8217;t trust NIST anymore. It&#8217;s not just the NSA/elliptic curve debacle, it&#8217;s the position of government(s) to spy on it&#8217;s citizens and failure to support reforms regarding privacy and security.</p>
<p>And, that&#8217;s in part why I think it&#8217;s probably good to change passwords once per year or so now, especially on sensitive communication or financial apps. Our data, everyone&#8217;s data is under such intense surveillance these days I must assume &#8216;they&#8217; are collecting and storing passwords by the billions. Then there are the massive hacks that have impacted almost every American, maybe everyone. Last, the criminals seem to be getting better at circumventing our seemingly Swiss cheese security measures.</p>
<p>Recently, I was pretty sure my router was hacked and it seemed the vector was a remote login requiring a password. The attacks seemed to be coming from an American university, close to a TLA mega center. And, I am certain I am completely boring when they rifled through my stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, WHAT IF governments, corporations and criminals are secretly and purposely harvesting vast quantities of pws just because they can?</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t you change up fairly often?</p>

<p>Right&#8230; but there&#8217;s a lower bar that actually does make computational sense.<br />
It&#8217;s trivial to brute force 5 digits.  You can do that on an Xbox 1 -maybe.<br />
People WOULD use 5 digit p/w&#8217;s and be fuzzed in seconds.  Not a great option.<br />
You should want somewhere north of 12 if you&#8217;re going to have any p/w at all.</p>
<p>Unless they&#8217;ve got draconian failure timeouts after 3 strikes, you want a lower dig limit.</p>

				<p>@Kris,</p>
<p>Eliminating short passwords doesn&#8217;t save anywhere near as much time as you think.  If you actually do the math, you&#8217;ll find that the total number of passwords of 1 to 19 characters is far smaller than the total number of 20-character passwords.  (Examples with smaller numbers: there are 10,000 4-digit PINs, while there are only 1,110 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit PINs. There are 456,978 4-character alphabetic passwords.  There are only 18,287 one-, two-, and three-character passwords.)</p>

				<p>Password expiry (not expiration; proper English, please): It&#8217;s still valid, because of all the breaches. It&#8217;s hardly a good control, but I&#8217;ll take it over not having it.</p>
<p>Does anyone actually still trust NIST? I don&#8217;t bother with any other their stuff any more for obvious reasons. As with most big American companies, they are corrupt and a pawn of the NSA.</p>
<p>Password managers? As with all software, they have vulnerabilities. I don&#8217;t use them. Writing down passwords in a secure location is still the answer, although I know this doesn&#8217;t solve the corporate problem.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m a big believer in the post-it-note-on-the-keyboard technique.  This is just fine, imho, if your threat model is script kiddies trying to log into your remote computer.  It&#8217;s the wrong thing to do if your foes have access to your desk, be they creepy relatives, creepy co-workers, creepy cops with a warrant, or creepy CIA agents on a black bag mission.</p>
<p>The notes can also be a real plus if you have a stroke or heart attack &#8211; your grieving business partners and/or heirs can get to important files.</p>

				<p>The &#8220;log in to device then password manager&#8221; problem is worse with encrypted disks. I have a whole bunch of passwords that can&#8217;t meaningfully be stored in a manger (which I use for the other &#8230;checks&#8230; 200+ passwords I need).</p>
<p>I have the following pattern: decrypt, log in, password manager; where only the last one has a common passphrase. So there&#8217;s four passphrases and three passwords that I use almost every day &#8211; work laptop, home laptop, password manager. Oh, and &#8220;home laptop booted into windows to play games&#8221;&#8230; 8 digit PIN. Which is written on the laptop because that doesn&#8217;t really affect the security of a machine running Windows, Steam, NVDIA drivers and all the other malware that I need to play certain games.</p>

				<p>My credit union, of all places, has this excellent advice on setting up your account: Don&#8217;t use any part of your name or your email address as part of your login name. There may have been other suggestions as well, but these are what stuck with me.</p>
<p>Not only did they suggest this, they also forced a one-time account name change on everybody within N days of changing the user name policy.</p>
<p>As a result, I now have some other sites where my newly created account name is a randomly generated string, which I cut and paste from the KeePass initial password to the user name field, after which I have it generate a new password.</p>
<p>A huge mistake most folks make with respect to password reset questions is to answer the asked question. Instead, I use non-contextual answers that I record in KeePass.</p>

				<p>And the big thing about password managers that isn&#8217;t addressed is that they change a Something you know into a Something you have. The same as if you write down a password on a post it note (in a password protected safe).</p>

<p>bluetooth is assumed not secure so the input stick is not secure against eavesdropping. At rest the passwords presumably stay on your phone so they are as safe as your lost phone is.</p>

				<p>Bruce Schneier is an authority on theoretical cryptography/cryptology. But why should we take him seriously on practical security, when he, by his own admission, is using windows machine as his &#8220;secure&#8221; machine. lol. Security on windows is an oxymoron.</p>

				<p>The periodic password change fallacy is a remnant of old technology usage practices, namely easily accessible password hashes.</p>
<p>In the past Unix installations, all data about user accounts were stored in a plaintext file readable by everyone on the system &#8211; /etc/passwd &#8211; including password hashes. These were the &#8220;friendly&#8221; days, where those who had access to a multi-user non-networked system were few and limited to the employees or patrons of a particular company or institution. It was important to know who has an account on the system and what his/her user ID is, to enable cooperation. Therefore the /etc/passwd entry contained not only technical information, but also the real name and often also the department, room number and telephone number of the user. Even in the (early) days of networked systems there were publicly available network services (yp/nis, finger) to look up an account and even see if the user is currently logged in. The password hashes were stored along the other data because it was easy to do and it was secure enough &#8211; the computing power available was too small to brute force the hashes in a sensible time.</p>
<p>The practice of password expiry and forced change was bolted on later (as a small backwards-compatible change to the file format) to mitigate the risk of brute force guessing by forcing the user to change the password before anyone could be remotely able to guess the password, even with a tremendous (for the time) computing power.</p>
<p>Later, because the brute force guessing (also using dictionary guessing) become more feasible, hashes were moved to another file, not readable by everyone (/etc/shadow). It complicated the handling of account data a little bit, but was immune to brute forcing of hashes, unless there was an admin-level system compromise.</p>
<p>Today, periodic password change practice is a cargo cult.</p>
<p>Sometimes it goes to the level of complete absurdity. In one company I worked for before, there was a policy of monthly password change on ALL systems &#8211; including the ones that were reasonably used once a month or even less frequently, such as employee payroll statements. To retrieve the electronic &#8220;payroll slips&#8221; I had to change the password EVERY TIME I accessed the system.</p>

				<ul>
<li>If you are using passwords, then you&#8217;ve already lost the game.</li>
<li>If you must use a password, nothing replaces length.  25+ characters, but 50+ if you use a password manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, there will always be 3 places where some sort of password/passphrase are required.<br />
1) Login to the main computer that you sit behind.<br />
2) Access the password manager.<br />
3) Decryption of the whole disk encryption used.<br />
Each of these vulnerable &#8216;unlock&#8217; tasks can be enhanced by using 2FA of some sort.</p>
<p>Take a look at OTP, U2F, and other enterprisey solutions.  These can work for home as well. No need to pay, there are F/LOSS versions.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone knows to use a different random, 50+ character, passphrase for all online accounts, right?</p>
<p>If is also smart to use different email addresses to segment your different types of online accounts.  An email address used for banking should never be used on social media, for example.  Probably want 3-4 (at least) email addresses.</p>

				<p>@Pete: &#8220;Of course, everyone knows to use a different random, 50+ character, passphrase for all online accounts, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>IMPORTANT online accounts, yes. I won&#8217;t be so extreme as 50+ for most cases, but it&#8217;s just my opinion.</p>
<p>But almost everyone has TONS of shitty accounts of negligible value &#8211; various fora, (nearly-)one-time online shopping (the ones that don&#8217;t store payment info of course!) etc. I use either one of a few common passwords or store random ones in an unencrypted file (why bother?).</p>
<p>@Pete: &#8220;If is also smart to use different email addresses to segment your different types of online accounts.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good for security AND spam control. I usually use a different email address for each shitty account, identifying the provider, like <a href="mailto:&#x73;&#104;&#x69;&#116;&#x74;&#121;&#x2d;&#115;&#x65;&#114;&#x76;&#105;&#x63;&#101;&#x2e;&#099;&#x6f;&#109;&#x40;&#109;&#x79;&#100;&#x6f;&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6e;&#046;&#x74;&#108;&#x64;" rel="nofollow ugc">&#x73;&#104;&#x69;&#116;&#x74;&#121;&#x2d;&#115;&#x65;&#114;&#x76;&#105;&#x63;&#101;&#x2e;&#099;&#x6f;&#109;&#x40;&#109;&#x79;&#100;&#x6f;&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6e;&#046;&#x74;&#108;&#x64;</a>. It is easy to block them if they&#8217;re abused. For some, I use one-time addresses like <a href="mailto:&#116;&#101;&#x6d;p&#078;&#x4e;&#x4e;&#078;&#064;&#x6d;y&#100;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#097;&#105;&#x6e;&#x2e;&#116;&#x6c;&#x64;" rel="nofollow ugc">&#116;&#101;&#x6d;p&#078;&#x4e;&#x4e;&#078;&#064;&#x6d;y&#100;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#097;&#105;&#x6e;&#x2e;&#116;&#x6c;&#x64;</a>, then block them right after use. I just keep track of NNNN and increment it every time 🙂</p>
<p>I just wish I could have multiple, but still deliverable, street addresses&#8230; If I got paper spam from some random company I would know who to sue/report for breach/sale of my data.</p>

				<p>Kris: as Mark points out, preventing small passwords doesn&#8217;t &#8220;eliminate&#8221; a huge amount of effort, to the contrary, short passwords are easily dealt with, as described in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/</a>: &#8220;It started with a brute-force crack for all passwords containing one to six characters &#8230; Gosney next brute-force cracked all passwords of length seven or eight that contained only lower letters. Next, he brute-forced all passwords made up solely of numbers from one to 12 digits long&#8221;.</p>
<p>Note that the attack described in the article was made possible by a poor choice of hash function (MD5), which takes us back to Schneier&#8217;s dictum &#8220;fix the security systems, not the users&#8221;. In my opinion, if providers took reasonable precautions, password strength would matter little; and if they don&#8217;t take reasonable precautions, then we are screwed anyway. I&#8217;m using easily memorizable passwords as much as possible on systems that I consider not sensitive, and really sensitive stuff like banking is protected by strong security (not passwords) or I wouldn&#8217;t use it.</p>

				<p><b>PASSWORD MANAGER RISK</b>: If antivirus are the &#8220;ultimate backdoor&#8221; then weak or backdoored password managers are cheaper and easier to make for the same adversaries. If information is the objective and most of it is in the cloud then obtaining credentials is more useful than scanning local disks (see recent Kapersky news)</p>
<p>2FA, second factor authentication does not add risk and solves the problem of weak passwords if correctly implemented and can even solve phishing if FIDO U2F tokens are used.</p>
<p><b>I would replace #3 by a recommendation to use 2FA, FIDO U2F or better if available.</b></p>

				<p>&#8220;Today, don&#8217;t make people change their passwords unless there&#8217;s indication of compromise.</p>
<p>Sorry, but I don&#8217;t buy this one.  Lots of use cases for changing passwords regularly.  Last year we had a good one.  Admin decided to make a script that would do some work for him in AD.  As part of the script, he needed to provide his username/password.  He created the script with that information, ran the script, then deleted the script.  No problem, right?</p>
<p>Not so much.  He used Notepad++ which automatically makes backups of your files with a different extension.  Our pentesters found that file with the admin&#8217;s username/password in it.  Fortunately, there had been a password change for that admin between the time he wrote the script and the time the pentester found it.  Day saved.</p>

				<blockquote><p>
  minimum entropy check
</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s no such thing. For example, the string BQraHxxiYJXK43Do looks pretty random, but (a) generated uniformly randomly from letters and numbers it is exactly as likely as 0000000000000000, and (b) I recommend you do not use it as a password since it&#8217;s now posted on a web forum.</p>
<p>You can maybe calculate an upper bound on the entropy based on an assumption of how it might have been generated, but to pin a minimum entropy on it you&#8217;d need to know how good the initial keying material was, how good the PRNG is, and how the password was derived from the PRNG output.</p>
<p>As another example, which is more random: BQraHxxiYJXK43Do or &#8220;fungi electroballistic mauvette unspecked prenaris hyperbole&#8221;? The former has an entropy of roughly 95 bits assuming uniform selection from [A-Za-z0-9]{16}, but the latter depends on the size of the dictionary used. In my case, that dictionary happens to have 235886 words, giving the latter ~107 bits of entropy, but there&#8217;s no way to know that by just looking at a single password.</p>

				<p>Point of data (personal experience):</p>
<p>Password managers are nice. They also expose sites that don&#8217;t hash passwords before transmission. The main problems are that they aren&#8217;t available on all type of computers that I use (there are 4 different OSes at my desk at the moment), and sometimes I think that I will never need to type in a password (so I use a long, automatically-generated one), and I&#8217;m wrong.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve only tripped over a complexity requirement once in the past decade. Well-generated random passwords almost always pass the complexity requirements. Usually the problems are either requiring a short length (likely because they don&#8217;t hash) or limiting the alphabet to some fraction of ASCII (no idea why).</p>
<p>Expiration tends to make my passwords worse. For non-expiring passwords that I need to memorize, I tend to either use very long strings that aren&#8217;t particularly random, shorter ones that are somewhat random, or very short (10-12 chars) that are generated randomly. For expiring passwords, particularly if the expiration is frequent, they will expire at some time when I don&#8217;t have time to generate or memorize a good password. Thus I end up with short, not particularly random passwords, often related to the last password I had. This isn&#8217;t a simple increment, but it&#8217;s still in the top few hundred guesses one might make if one had cracked the prior password.</p>

				<blockquote><p>
  On the other hand, why would you have to choose another password every 90 days?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Many years ago, in college, I got some extra cash by hacking into people&#8217;s e-mails and selling the passwords. It didn&#8217;t earn me many Brownie badges but business was good. My &#8220;clients&#8221; got the compromised password and proxy access and they&#8217;d sit there for months, sometimes years, quietly funneling messages into their boxes. More often than not the account owner had no indication whatsoever that their e-mails had been compromised. This was before 2FA and geolocation filters. My point is, the only thing that (inadvertently) saved the poor suckers was that some eventually changed their passwords, locking my clients out.</p>

				<p>Um, I code iterative password hash schemes with multiple UTFs and hash algs, as long as the final hash fits the required length, 500+ at little cost versus complexity. I go beyond keyboard set and allow anything.</p>
<p>So, have you ever heard a publicly available system come with such an iterative scheme? It sounds like a cheap trick, but if you are in the position to code something, a solid deterrent. Code your own password manager like this. Pros will argue that code exposure must be a known. I say skipping the iterative scheme is a missed chance at reinforcement.</p>
<p>For distributed brute force, the idea of limiting to keyboard set already tips in favor of the cracker. Brute forcing a single hash in an academic setting with a multi-threaded/tasks app is do-able. Distributing the workload is easy. Furthermore, most of the complexity formulas I have seen do not take into account leveraging multi-threaded parallelization or GPU chaining for time reduction on the crack. We can render 3D math. A single hash is trivial.</p>

A 16-bit instruction/address was input manually, in octal[1], via <em>stiff</em> toggle switches.  On the plus side, this mini was not connected to the world.  PASSWORD?  What the heck is a password?!</p>
<p>[1] To read paper tape in the absence of an OS, one would toggle in the starting address of the BBL (Basic Binary Loader; a short program residing in protected upper memory), hit Load Address button, hit Run button.  I suspect I&#8217;ll still remember the BBL addr even after I forget my own name.  017700(octal).   🙂</p>

<blockquote><p>Mea culpa. I got it wrong too.</p></blockquote>
<p>You didn’t; it’s a case-insensitive system 🙂 Or it’s a language that has no notion of upper and lower case letters. In Chinese it would be 50,000<sup>4</sup>+ (I didn’t do the math.)</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong answer until the specification is defined.</p>

<blockquote><p>But why should we take him seriously on practical security, when he, by his own admission, is using windows machine as his &#8220;secure&#8221; machine. </p></blockquote>
<p>I think you don&#8217;t understand &#8220;practical security&#8221; either.</p>
<p>Firstly there are good and proper reasons to use Windows, so the question moves to &#8220;mitigation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Any worthwhile practitioner of &#8220;practical security&#8221; knows that nothing is implicitly secure. That is you have to design secure systems from subsystems and other components that can in no way be secure as they lack the functionality required.</p>
<p>Thus you can use Windows in a default or other mode, and it&#8217;s security depends not on the OS or applications on it, but how you build them into an overall system.</p>
<p>The simplist example of this would be an &#8220;energy gapped&#8221; laptop, that data was got onto it via OCR read in scans of paper documents, and data was got out by printed paper documents. Provided the energy gap is maintained and the documents are in a form where they are not carrying malware[1]. Then it does not matter if the computer runs Windows, Linux, BSD or some other more secure OS.</p>
<p>[1] It has been shown that some OCR software can be effected by the documents and act as a potential attack weapon.</p>

				<p>People always bring up dictionary attacks. I have actually not successfully used a dictionary attack. You can just default to brute-force. This is why crazy character combos, still keyboard set, are not any better. You could use a foreign word or phonetics and skip a dictionary, which is poor guessing.</p>

<p>Then we need nested levels of “Energy-Gaps”. Scan in a first energy gap, move to a pure text file, print, then take to the next “Energy-Gapped” system for another round of OCR.</p>

				<p>NIST should advise FBO, DLA, SAM, and assorted 100 DOD sites; each of them expire the passwords every 90 days .. have arcane rules and employ 100&#8217;s of useless staff who&#8217;s sole job is to reset passwords &#8212; and they have devolved stupidly complex rules for delivery of new passwords.</p>
<p>Unemployment in Richmond, DC and suburbs is likely to increase 10 folds if you get rid of this &#8220;high tech&#8221; jobs &#8212; but who am I kidding .. I bet you they will be still resetting passwords 100 years from now.<br />
Once started NOTHING can change anything in govt. any more .. this party too is over for good.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had to reset my quickbooks password in nearly 8 years.</p>

				<p>For those having issues with pasting passwords from password managers, it&#8217;s possible to circumvent those restrictions.</p>
<p>This is specific to Chrome, but there&#8217;s probably alternatives in other major browsers.</p>
<p>Press F12 to bring up the developer console.  Under the &#8220;Elements&#8221; tab there&#8217;s a window on the right side that has an &#8220;Event Listeners&#8221; tab.  Find the &#8220;paste&#8221; handler and remove it.  That will restore the default paste behavior.</p>
<p>This is only temporary (when the page is reloaded, the handler will be re-added as well) but it&#8217;s a workaround.  You should contact the webmaster of the page in question and advise them to remove the handler.</p>

				<p>@ Wael,</p>
<blockquote><p>Must be a &#8220;Jim Dandy&#8221; set of information you’re trying to protect 😉</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t ask or look so I don&#8217;t know, nor do I want to know. I give advice on how to stop information leaking. In that respect I&#8217;m like a &#8220;lock smith&#8221; I&#8217;ll ask you a few questions, tell you what I think you need and if you want &#8220;install the furniture&#8221; to do it. What you keep behind the locked doors is your business, not mine.</p>
<blockquote><p>Then we need nested levels of “Energy-Gaps”. </p></blockquote>
<p>In essence yes, back in the old days before people had &#8220;rich documents&#8221; full of images, you could send text via a serial port to the &#8220;instrumentation box&#8221; / &#8220;data sluice&#8221;. That cleaned out any oddities by a set of clear rules then sent the result onwards to the other side of the &#8220;air-gap&#8221; back then.</p>
<p>Unfortunately as was once observed &#8220;A picture is worth a thousand words&#8221;, or more like millions of bytes these days. With a corresponding level of redundancy for nasties to hide. Thankfulky work in the late 1990&#8217;s using 2D transforms to show Digital Watermarking was a waste of effort gave ways to manipulate an image so that hidden malware would get decimated but the picture look sufficiently similar to an observer.</p>

<p>So, Daniele&#8230; what&#8217;s the password policy at NIST these days? Must pick a password from a rainbow table, and it must not be near either end? I mean how else would NSA &#8220;get in&#8221;?</p>

				<pre>The problem with the old rules is that it required a minimum
length AND character set. What if the user wanted to use 8 diceware
words? Bad luck, because the rule required symbols.</pre>
<pre>We can fix that if we focus on password strength instead of rules.
We should allow the user to use any password -- as long as it
achieves a minimum strength.</pre>
<pre>If we follow xkcd's advice (4 random words), all of these passwords
should be acceptable:</pre>
<pre>
    * 4 random words
    * 7 mixed case alphanumeric characters
    * 8 mixed case letters
    * 9 lowercase letters
    * 13 digits
</pre>
<pre>But -- that's important -- we must draw a line somewhere! A 10-digit
password may not be acceptable.</pre>
<pre>IF a 10-digit password is acceptable, then the following passwords
should be acceptable as well:</pre>
<pre>
    * 3 random words
    * 6 mixed case alphanumeric
    * 7 letters
</pre>
<pre>(We define these examples according to the desired password
entropy.)</pre>
<pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
<pre>Indicate the desired password strength, but don't limit the user
options in terms of character set and length.</pre>
<pre>When the user submits the password, calculate the entropy and
accept or reject it, explaining why.</pre>

				<p>I will only relate my worst password experience in 45+ years of this thread topic.<br />
Fairly certain it was Banyon Vines but the past is dim so no offence intended<br />
The password &#8230;<br />
&#8211; expired every 21 days,<br />
&#8211; had to be at least 15 characters,<br />
&#8211; at least 1 of alpha caps, alpha lower, numeric and punctuation,<br />
&#8211; must not be a dictionary word (like the above would allow that),<br />
&#8211; must not be a permutation of or share more than 3 characters of<br />
  the users previous <b>8 passwords</b></p>
<p>The users found a way, they never logged out.<br />
With all that password BS the sessions never expired.</p>
<p>Users (and hackers) are clever, Security is hard.<br />

				<p>&#8220;must not be a permutation of or share more than 3 characters of<br />
the users previous 8 passwords&#8221;</p>
<p>So they must have stored the former passwords! Great security!</p>

				<p>As bigmacbear pointed out, PCI requirements are still Neandertalic:</p>
<blockquote><p><em></p>

<li>Require a minimum length of at least seven characters.

<li>Users to change passwords at least every 90 days.

				<p>I&#8217;m glad they (NIST, etal) have finally done this!</p>
<p>Where I currently work, my co-worker and I did a significant amount of research when we got employed here (about 8 years ago). The results of that research essentially echo these exact sentiments and we implemented those research results as our company&#8217;s password policy. We got a lot of weird looks, blank stares, and questions but it has proven extremely effective in balancing security and convenience. If you can leverage convenience of the user to your advantage (ease of management) then you can actually increase your security posture.</p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been wondering about for quite a while (mostly as an academic thought) but I&#8217;ve been wondering as to whether or not there have been any research or even musings on use of formulae/equations as passwords?</p>
<p>1) What is their prevalence within the used/compromised password space compared to other phrases?</p>
<p>2) Would they be more or less &#8220;guessable&#8221; compared to other phrases? I can&#8217;t recall ever seeing them in any dictionaries we&#8217;ve used for conducting password audits.</p>

				<p>EPA just issued its new password requirements.  You&#8217;re gonna love that the government is ignoring its experts:</p>
<blockquote><p>New character count requirement for LAN passwords</p>
<p>Beginning Dec. 13, EPA employees changing their LAN password will need to comply with new character count requirements. The change is to help ensure employees strengthen their passwords, which is critical to information security. </p>
<p>The current eight-character password is being increased to a minimum of 12 characters with the following requirements:<br />
•   Password length must be a minimum of 12 characters and contain characters from three of the following four categories:<br />
o   At least one digit (0-9).<br />
o   At least one symbol (~, !, @, #, $, %, +, , /, ?).<br />
o   At least one uppercase English letter (A-Z).<br />
o   At least one lowercase English letter (a-z).<br />
•   Must not contain your username, dictionary words, simple words, or any part of your full name that exceeds two characters (example: cannot be ‘SMI’, if your last name is ‘SMITH’).<br />
•   Must differ from previous password by four characters.<br />
•   Must differ from previous 24 passwords.</p></blockquote>
<p>And no, we cannot use a password manager either.</p>

				<p>Our company wants the password our vendor uses to connect to our network to expire every three months. Given it might be a couple of years between logins ans the have 2-3 factor security I think this is mad, and could cause a significant delay if our mobile network goes down (I am authorized to change it but will not be reachable if it is seriously needed)<br />
Has anyone else seen this in any other company?</p>

				<p>@ Tony,</p>
<blockquote><p>Has anyone else seen this in any other company?</p></blockquote>
<p>Not directly the same, but yes similar. Usually somebody is playing the game of &#8220;follow the auditor&#8221; who in turn is following somebody elses recomendations. A few hops skips and jumps later you find some bureaucrat issued document based on a &#8220;Best Practice&#8221; puff piece some organisation issued that is now more than half a decade old.</p>
<p>Almost invariably you will find a &#8220;check list&#8221; in there that has been mangled in some way.</p>
<p>There are three ways you can deal with it.</p>
<p>Firstly the do nothing approach of just ignore or comply.</p>
<p>Secondly make an attack tree of all the measures in place and make a selection. Then put them before managment &#8220;as a more cost effective&#8221; method with other supporting paperwork (oh and don&#8217;t hold your breath waiting for it to get serious consideration. Internal recommendations rarely out rank expensive external contractor recommendations&#8230;).</p>
<p>Thirdly hunt down where the ideas actually came from and get them to adjust to a more modern approach, if they ever will.</p>
<p>The reason you will probably need to just grit your teath is &#8220;legal&#8221;. Often such things are put together to touch all bases just in case of litigation&#8230;</p>

<p>-&gt;There is a simple reason for BitLocker on 128bit AES-&gt;Performance<br />
-&gt;There is a simple reason for BitLocker don&#8217;t allowing Special characters if not configured to do so-&gt;normal users would lock themselves out of their machine, by making a very heavy Password, and at next start they get Aware of not being able to Input These characters with the boot-up englisch Keyboard layout on their e.g. german Keyboard.</p>
