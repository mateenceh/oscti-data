		<h2 class="entry">Reasonably Clever Extortion E-mail Based on Password Theft</h2>
		<p>Imagine you&#8217;ve gotten your hands on a file of e-mail addresses and passwords. You want to monetize it, but the site it&#8217;s for isn&#8217;t very valuable. How do you use it? You convince the owners of the password to send you money.</p>
<p>I recently saw a spam e-mail that ties the password to a porn site. The e-mail title contains the password, which is sure to get the recipient&#8217;s attention.</p>
<blockquote><p>I do know, yhhaabor, is your password. You may not know me and you&#8217;re most likely thinking why you&#8217;re getting this email, right?</p>
<p>actually, I actually setup a malware on the adult video clips (pornographic material) web site and you know what, you visited this web site to have fun (you know what I mean). While you were watching videos, your web browser began operating as a RDP (Remote Desktop) having a key logger which provided me accessibility to your display and web camera. after that, my software obtained your entire contacts from your Messenger, social networks, and email.</p>
<p>What exactly did I do?</p>
<p>I created a double-screen video. First part shows the video you were viewing (you&#8217;ve got a fine taste ; )), and 2nd part displays the recording of your webcam.</p>
<p>What should you do?</p>
<p>Well, I believe, $2900 is a reasonable price for our little secret. You will make the payment through Bitcoin (if you don&#8217;t know this, search &#8220;how to buy bitcoin&#8221; in Google).</p></blockquote>
<p>This is clever. The valid password establishes legitimacy. There&#8217;s a decent chance the recipient has visited porn sites, and maybe set up an account for which they can&#8217;t remember the password. The RDP attack is plausible, as is turning on the camera and downloading the contacts file.</p>
<p>Of course, it all fails because there isn&#8217;t enough detail. If the attacker actually did all of this, they would include the name of the porn site and attached the video file.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s a clever attack, and one I have not seen before. If the attacker asked for an order of magnitude less money, I think they would make more.</p>
<p>EDITED TO ADD: Brian Krebs has <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/sextortion-scam-uses-recipients-hacked-passwords/">written</a> about this, too.</p>

				<p>it is clever because the actual attack exits<br />
it happened to a colleague of mine.<br />
He got filmed while &#8220;talking&#8221; to a webcam girl.<br />
He was send the actual video and asked to pay 2000euro. He did not pay and the video was send to his entire email address book.</p>

<p>Idea 0: you check for username + password reuse on sites that <i>are</i> valuable.</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s a sort of interesting attack, but the solution is to just not have your cam on, ever, unless you need it.</p>
<p>Most cams in laptops have hardware or software fn key switches (if you fear spies too then tape over it), webcams you can unplug, etc.</p>
<p>Or to &#8216;have your fun&#8217; under the table&#8230;</p>
<p>It also throws lots of jargon around (some of it silly, like why does double-screen video even matter?) and preys on the unknowing, plus the typical luck of someone watching videos online via a browser (and not downloading them like many premium sites allow you to, or torrenting or youtube-dling them to their seedbox and then downloading them for offline viewing, or streaming them to his/her tablet, or reading erotica or watching cam streams online instead of watching videos), but for free users that might as well be the most popular &#8216;consumation&#8217; method of &#8216;adult materials&#8217;, so if they do something that&#8217;s the best chance.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve once seen a similar case where some old man paid just to not fight such accusations despite not even having a computer, let alone internet (his scam arrived via mail, from one of the copyright troll companies that go after torrenters and such).</p>

				<p>Interestingly Krebs has a similar article, only it&#8217;s $1400 there instead of $2900.</p>

				<p>Isn&#8217;t this a Black Mirror episode?</p>
<p>OK, serious question&#8230;  What&#8217;s the game theory analysis that leads one to believe that $2900 buys silence?  Isn&#8217;t this just a situation where you&#8217;re self-identifying as someone willing to act as an ATM for the attacker?</p>
<p>At least in the scam where the attacker encrypts your hard drive, you know pretty quickly whether you wasted the payment and  know not to pay a second time.  This, I just don&#8217;t see as being as effective.  Much more emotionally compelling, I agree, but once you sit and think for a second, how could you possibly trust the hacker to live up to his end of the bargain?</p>

				<p>I got one of those a few weeks back asking for 430 USD, which is a lot more &#8220;reasonable&#8221;. However, mine didn&#8217;t even have a password in it to lend credibility. It did have some nice touches though:</p>
<p>&#8220;You have one day after opening my message, I put the special tracking pixel in it, so when you will open it I will see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;which struck me as quite the feat in a mail with mimetype text/plain. I wonder why they didn&#8217;t <em>actually</em> add one.</p>
<p>&#8220;If ya want me to share proofs with ya, reply on this letter and I will send my creation to five contacts that I\&#8217;ve got from ur contacts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;ensuring of course that nobody would ever take up that offer for proof.</p>
<p>I always wonder what one can do in these cases. The mail was DKIM-signed for a domain registered through godaddy, so I contacted their abuse address with the mail attached. I have little hope that that actually achieves anything though.</p>

				<p>Be interesting to  learn what the response rate is.  My gut says that this scam is inefficient.  On the other hand, just one victim coughing up $2900 for, say, 5000 emails sent is nothing to sniff at; that one payment would buy a very nice laptop, for example.  When the scam reaches a vulnerable target, I imagine it resonates with great unpleasantness.</p>
<p>There are scams that utterly, epically fail, because the scenario they spin is &#8220;way out there&#8221; and the <em>target</em>knows* it.  For example, a phone scam has been hitting me for a couple of months: &#8220;&#8230; unusual activity on your iCloud account.  That your iCloud account has been breached&#8230;&#8221;   I&#8217;ve never had an &#8220;iCloud account&#8221; (nor &#8220;i-&#8221; anything), so a breach is impossible. =&gt; Delete message.  A previous scam dejour informed me that my Windows computer was disrupting the internet with errors and suggested I return the call and have them sort out the problem.  But nobody at this phone number has run Windows since the early 1990&#8217;s. =&gt; Delete message.</p>

				<p>This particular wave of emails appears to be based on an old copy of the LinkedIn user database, probably from around 2012. Messages were sent to email addresses that had only ever been used for linkedin, and the released passwords appear to be ones that were used for linkedin until around that time.</p>

				<p>@aa: &#8220;(some of it silly, like why does double-screen video even matter?)&#8221;</p>
<p>They mean split-screen or picture-in-picture, one video showing the feed from the user&#8217;s camera and one showing what they&#8217;re watching.  It&#8217;s only somewhat embarrassing for word to get out that you&#8217;re watching porn.  It&#8217;s <em>extremely</em> embarrassing for word to get out that you&#8217;re watching Barney the Dinosaur porn (or whatever you&#8217;re into).  The attacker is betting that the victim at least occasionally watches something they&#8217;re ashamed of.</p>

<p>What you are referring to as the same scam is a different scam from the one Bruce described. Your colleague (supposedly) really got filmed. Bruce&#8217;s attack depends only on an email address and matching password (I guess any additional personal info tending to confirm that it&#8217;s not just a spam-blast to a &#8216;millions&#8217; list would do). In the Bruce scenario, there is no video.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m doubtful; did your colleague actually show you this video? I have a feeling this may be a &#8216;friend-of-a-friend said&#8217; situation.</p>
<p>Tips for avoiding blackmail:<br />
&#8211; Don&#8217;t be a (serious) criminal<br />
&#8211; Be completely free of shame (especially about sex)</p>
<p>The only things that cause me shame happened decades ago (and weren&#8217;t to do with sex); and none of the crimes I routinely commit is anywhere near as serious as blackmail (blackmail is a very serious offence).</p>

				<p>@Jack O&#8217;Flonger &#8211; that&#8217;s the joke.</p>
<p>@Chelloveck &#8211; I get that part but it just sounds silly. You can put anything you want together with someone&#8217;s compromising video and it&#8217;s not a proof they watched what you added when &#8216;having fun&#8217;.</p>
<p>More thing are silly actually, like casually admitting to two huge hacks: a major porn website and a browser (to turn JS execution into a full take over of a PC) and mixing terminology and functions of a keylogger (that name is dropped but the function description doesn&#8217;t match it), RDP (why MS&#8217;s RDP, lol, it&#8217;s not even available on Home by default IIRC, and what a feat would it be to make a browser into an RDP server, and isn&#8217;t it obvious to the person in front of the PC when RDP is used?), trojan (that&#8217;s what is described), etc.</p>

				<p>Jeff, the popularity of gambling suggests that many people lack an intuitive grasp of game theory. I wouldn&#8217;t pay either, but the wallet links posted in this thread show that some people will.</p>
<p>The game theory for the attacker, one might suppose, is to carpetbomb the world with spam in the hopes of finding some people who don&#8217;t behave according to game theory. The different payment requests might be an effort to utilize randomness to get some large payments without pricing everyone out.</p>

				<p>I view this as having an almost inoculative effect. Sure, people on this blog can assert &#8220;this is dumb, I have tape on my camera / don&#8217;t have a camera / (insert OPSEC 101 bullet point here)&#8221; but for me the take-home is that we&#8217;ve already been wearing that advice thin to our associates who use poorer OPSEC and they simply never pay attention.</p>
<p>When they get an email like this, even if it&#8217;s a near miss (meaning they do figure out that they&#8217;re safe from the accusation but still have to think for a good minute to assure themselves of it), or even if it&#8217;s related to them by somebody else, it at least begins to increase the perceived value <em>of</em> such OPSEC considerations and of doing some bare minimum to improve one&#8217;s privacy hygiene.</p>
<hr />
<p>@Just a random person @Karin Spaink<br />
In other news, my reply to &#8220;the bitcoin address already had 6 transactions from prior days totaling 1.1 BTC.&#8221; or &#8220;has managed to extot five people by no, and he&#8217;s got 1,5 bitcoin by now.&#8221; is that it&#8217;s rather trivial for the attacker to prime the pump by sending multiple payments from their own presumably anonymous sources to the payment address just to give whoever might peek an indication that people really are coughing up, thus inferring that perhaps they should too.</p>

				<p>@ All,</p>
<p>One thing that does come out of this is that traditional crimes do mainly transfer across to the Internet.</p>
<p>But they have one new angle which is that of &#8220;The army of one&#8221;.</p>
<p>When you consider traditional blackmail is actually not that common as to &#8220;get the goods on somebody&#8221; usually means &#8220;you are known to that somebody&#8221;. To get the goods and still in effect be anonymous the Blackmailer usually &#8220;gets the goods&#8221; through a third party that is known to the person being blackmailed. This gives &#8220;tracability&#8221; thus the &#8220;goods&#8221; realy have to be quite devestating or the victim will &#8220;call the bluff of the blackmailer&#8221; and track them down.</p>
<p>To most the Internet means untracable thus a modern blackmailer feels a lot more secure as well as sending a threat to hundreds if not hundreds of thousands of people more easily than sending just one tradirional blackmail letter.</p>
<p>Thus we can expect Internet Blackmail to be many many times more frequent than traditional blackmail. But importantly the odds of their actually being any &#8220;goods&#8221; is as many if not more times lower.</p>
<p>@ Mark,</p>
<blockquote><p>I haven&#8217;t gotten one yet, I&#8217;m feeling left out </p></blockquote>
<p>Post your details here and I&#8217;m sure there will be one along soon 😉</p>
<p>Joking aside the Internet is a very very target rich environment, thus the odds of any individual getting attacked this way are actually quite low.</p>
<p>But a few people could spot the way things were going thus don&#8217;t have any form of data slurping &#8220;socialmedia&#8221; or other &#8220;Cloud&#8221; based systems to have credentials stolen from. I don&#8217;t have nor ever had social media, I did once have a social email address on gmail but that is long gone.</p>
<p>Whilst I&#8217;m in no way invulnerable to attack due to those changes[1], I have moved myself up a layer or three in the fruit tree. Which means like you I get to miss such invitations, as well as those &#8220;blue pill&#8221; &#8220;male enhancment&#8221; products and invitations from Nigerian Princes&#8230;</p>
<p>The point is though that it is like the old joke about two men being chased by a bear. Suddenly one of them kneels down and starts tying his shoe laces. The other aghast says to his friend &#8220;You won&#8217;t out run the bear by tying your laces&#8230;&#8221; The kneeling man replies &#8220;I don&#8217;t have to out run the bear only you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>That is the real reality of Internet security currently, not being the lowest hanging fruit&#8230;</p>
<p>Thus for non targeted attacks being a slightly harder nut to crack causes criminal attackers to go for the abundance of weaker targets&#8230;</p>
<p>[1] As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, I use other techniques to raise my &#8220;fruit&#8221; quite a bit further up towards the top of the tree. That is well away from &#8220;low hanging fruit&#8221;.</p>

				<p>Seriously though, I would be impressed. My webcam is in a box several feet away from my home computer, and remains there unless I really, really want to teleconference. I do have laptops with webcams, but they all have solid metal gates over them, and not even maxing out gain will get you more than light bleed from around the edges of the cam.</p>
<p>Do people really leave webcams (or user-facing cameras on tablets) live, after all the scare stories in the media about people peeping though them?</p>

&#8220;Do people really leave webcams (or user-facing cameras on tablets) live, after all the scare stories in the media about people peeping though them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Some people forget the silly camera is &#8230; well, a camera; some think, who would target <em>me</em>?  Others just don&#8217;t care (until fate pays a visit to change their mind).</p>
<p>Does anyone actually read emails without looking closely at the sender&#8217;s address?  A-firm!</p>
<p>Do people actually respond to email from addresses they don&#8217;t recognize?  Yup.</p>
<p>Who clicks a link in an email; that&#8217;s nuts!<br />
Many, apparently.  And yes, that behavior is nuts.</p>
<p>Who, in this age of skimmers, still swipes their <em>chipped</em> debit or credit card?  Oh my&#8230; where to start.</p>
<p>The point is, some people don&#8217;t take their own security seriously (e.g. some of my siblings, sadly).  There are reasons for that but few, if any, of them are excuses.</p>

				<p>So, I just got hit with two of these emails. I do believe we&#8217;re entering the copycat phase. I checked my password safe against the gibberish in the subject line &#8211; neither matches anything I&#8217;ve used in the past decade and a half, and both e-mails arrived to a public-facing address I would not have used with anything requiring a password (other than the account itself). For maximum amusement, I provide the text, with only the &#8220;passwords&#8221; trimmed out in case they&#8217;re actually valid for someone someone else out there:</p>
<p>= = = = = = = =</p>
<p>Subject: ID (gibberish)!<br />
Good afternoon! While you beat the dummy watching erotic website your laptop computer have been injected. For the present moment I am provided with all the necessary dirt and contacts of all your nearest and dearest. Yours front camera was set to work with a help of the software program and filmed and takes photographs. At the same time I have all data to yours SNSs user accounts. You must send USD 400 to my Bitcoin address 18CSXANqriPc4nVDZ65NVLQRhwLBMCF5Zr In a case if you do not like me to forward all the files ( when you had been fucking off ) to your relatives and coworkers. Otherways if I do not obtain remittance within twentyfour hours I going to send compromising material to all loved ones and workfellows and to Net. If you going to fulfill all that terms I would shut down all this photos and video.<br />
You should know that the key point in your life is family values and it will be a good experience for the future. There was no that sort of situation if you do not make that ugly things. Be meticulous about next time With respect.<br />
P.S. After watching this mail you own only twentyfour hours.</p>
<p>= = = = = = = =</p>
<p>Subject: Malware on your device ID (gibberish)!!<br />
How are you!<br />
I guess that my message is completely unsuspected for you!<br />
I have unpleasant news!<br />
Last time when you visited porno Web-site, you laptop was attacked by malicious software.<br />
That virus turned on frontfacing camera of your laptop computer. And now I have something incriminating against you. On that vidoerecord you feel yourself.<br />
Pretty soon that computer virus could gain entrance to yours leads. And it is going to send clip to your confidants.<br />
If you want to put a line under it? Then you have to send me 400$  in Bitcoin.<br />
It is my Bitcoin number &#8211; 1CKdrGGLCB1r6aqTkZFhii7AqYPwWts4VR<br />
Waste no time! You have only 24 hours! I apologize for grammar &#8211; I am not native speaker.</p>
<p>= = = = = = = =</p>
<p>Ending with &#8220;With respect&#8221; and a apology for poor grammar. A bit of civility is so often missing from extortion, don&#8217;t you think?</p>

				<p>I got one via Hotmail last Saturday.  Instead of deleting it right away, I looked at it and then deleted it.  No password was involved, it was just a straightforward fishing expedition but I didn&#8217;t have the requisite guilty conscience.  Unfortunately, my Hotmail address has been passed around for years and I get a fair amount of spam on it most of which I ignore. Sometimes the spam appears to come from a legitimate company and then I will unsubscribe.  Anyway, it&#8217;s interesting that the scam has come to Bruce&#8217;s attention.</p>

				<p>I had a relative call me having received one of these emails, at the same approximate time as having received a call from (quote-unquote) BT Technical Help Support.  I believe he has been receiving these calls for the last month or so and are likely unrelated, just coincidental timing.</p>
<p>Is anyone else aware of &#8220;tech support&#8221; calls being part of this scam?</p>

				<p>One doesn&#8217;t need to have visited a porn site or ever be compromised in any way. It&#8217;s sufficient for your address to appear publicly somewhere. I received three extortion messages that claimed to have installed malware when visiting sites that were never visited. Perhaps more were sent but did not make it past Google&#8217;s censorship.</p>

				<p>I friend got an extortion email yesterday. If contained -no- information proving he was hacked, just threats. If they sent 1000 emails, they might scare one person enough to pay the USD3900.  At least casino owners get a dependable percentage of bets; some of these guys may do better.</p>
<p>Wonder what the actual odds would be?</p>

<p>Aww, their investment is not paying out.</p>
<p>Funny thing. Sex isn&#8217;t a thing to be ashamed of.</p>
<h2>Text follows:</h2>
<p>I do know  one of your pass. Lets get directly to point. No person has paid me to investigate about you. You don&#8217;t know me and you&#8217;re most likely thinking why you&#8217;re getting this e mail?</p>
<p>Let me tell you, I installed a malware on the X video clips (porno) web-site and do you know what, you visited this web site to have fun (you know what I mean). While you were viewing videos, your internet browser started out working as a Remote Desktop having a key logger which provided me with accessibility to your display and webcam. Right after that, my software collected all of your contacts from your Messenger, Facebook, and emailaccount. Next I created a double video. 1st part displays the video you were watching (you&#8217;ve got a nice taste haha), and next part shows the view of your webcam, &amp; its you.</p>
<p>You actually have two choices. We will check out each of these options in details:</p>
<p>Very first choice is to neglect this e mail. In this scenario, I am going to send out your actual video recording to just about all of your contacts and then imagine concerning the humiliation you will get. Furthermore if you are in a relationship, how it will eventually affect?</p>
<p>Second choice will be to pay me . Let us call it a donation. In this scenario, I most certainly will instantaneously eliminate your videotape. You will carry on your daily routine like this never took place and you will not hear back again from me.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll make the payment via Bitcoin (if you don&#8217;t know this, search for &#8220;how to buy bitcoin&#8221; in Google).</p>
<p>BTC Address to send to:<br />
[case SENSITIVE copy &amp; paste it]</p>
<p>If you have been thinking about going to the cop, anyway, this email cannot be traced back to me. I have covered my steps. I am just not trying to charge a fee a huge amount, I prefer to be paid for. You have one day to make the payment. I have a unique pixel within this e mail, and now I know that you have read this mail. If I don&#8217;t receive the BitCoins, I will, no doubt send out your video to all of your contacts including family members, co-workers, etc. Nonetheless, if I receive the payment, I will erase the recording immidiately. It&#8217;s a nonnegotiable offer thus please do not waste my time and yours by replying to this mail. If you want proof, reply  Yeah and I will send out your video recording to your  friends.</p>

				<p>I had one of these emails.  It was startling, but because it clearly didn&#8217;t apply to me I ignored it.</p>
<p>These emails could have terrible consequences for some people.  I hate to think what could happen if a vulnerable person was sent one.</p>
<p>I have a friend with a daughter who is handicapped and has many issues with anxiety.  She got one of those phone calls that the IRS is sending the police to her house for non-payment of taxes.  She had a breakdown and couldn&#8217;t leave her room for three weeks.</p>
<p>I know the people sending these are anonymous but I wish they could see the damage they could cause.</p>

<p>Aside from the criminal element you make a very good point about the human impact.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have discovered a lot of organisations suffer from this problem too. Arbitrary decisions made without full consideration or well formed policies which don&#8217;t consider people as people and trample over the context of their life situation are far too common lately.</p>

				<p>FYI;<br />
I just received one of these &#8211; first time. Old password with name combo, which did not exist, but the numerical part of the combo was correct. Below I show the address of the sender, best as I could copy it:</p>
<p><a href="mailto:ksrourkelxu@outlook.com">ksrourkelxu@outlook.com</a>  &#8230;&#8230;. SHOWS as: Grantham Currier</p>
<p>Text of message:</p>
<p>I know xxxxxxxxxxx is your pass. Lets get right to point. Nobody has compensated me to investigate you. You don&#8217;t know me and you&#8217;re probably thinking why you&#8217;re getting this e mail?</p>
<p>actually, I actually installed a malware on the 18+ video clips (porno) web site and do you know what, you visited this website to have fun (you know what I mean). When you were watching videos, your web browser started out operating as a Remote Desktop having a key logger which provided me with accessibility to your screen as well as webcam. Right after that, my software program gathered all your contacts from your Messenger, FB, as well as e-mailaccount. And then I created a video. First part shows the video you were viewing (you&#8217;ve got a nice taste lol), and next part displays the view of your web camera, yea its you.</p>
<p>You actually have not one but two alternatives. Lets check out these types of solutions in details:</p>
<p>First choice is to ignore this email. In this situation, I am going to send your very own tape to each of your your contacts and just consider regarding the awkwardness you experience. Do not forget should you be in an important relationship, exactly how it will eventually affect?</p>
<p>Number 2 choice will be to compensate me $7000. Let us refer to it as a donation. In this case, I will straight away erase your videotape. You could keep on going your life like this never occurred and you surely will never hear back again from me.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll make the payment by Bitcoin (if you do not know this, search for &#8220;how to buy bitcoin&#8221; in Google).</p>
<p>BTC Address: 1HSPrPJuqsP49p6BNWJidwRDEFruDBLYNh<br />
[case-sensitive, copy &amp; paste it]</p>
<p>If you may be wondering about going to the authorities, surely, this e mail cannot be traced back to me. I have dealt with my actions. I am just not looking to charge you a huge amount, I simply prefer to be compensated. I&#8217;ve a unique pixel within this email, and at this moment I know that you have read through this mail. You have one day to make the payment. If I do not get the BitCoins, I will definitely send out your video recording to all of your contacts including family members, colleagues, etc. Nonetheless, if I receive the payment, I will erase the video right away. If you want to have proof, reply with Yea and I will certainly send your video recording to your 7 friends. It is a nonnegotiable offer, and thus please don&#8217;t waste mine time &amp; yours by responding to this e-mail.</p>

				<p>I just got one of these, demanding $7000.  Seems the price is going up.  This was the version with a real password I had used in the past.  I thought it was the password I used to use on Linked In, and sure enough, by resurrecting an old version of Password Safe (thanks Bruce), I verified it was what I used on Linked In before changing it when they sent out the message several years ago that they&#8217;d been hacked.</p>
<p>The password wasn&#8217;t really tough and a brute force attack should have been able to crack it if all they had were hashes.  Or perhaps Linked In were using plain text storage on those days.  I don&#8217;t know.  But I&#8217;m virtually certain I only used that for Linked In so that&#8217;s the source of this stuff.</p>

				<p>The BTC addres referenced on KerbsOn Security is<br />
<a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1Dvd7Wb72JBTbAcfTrxSJCZZuf4tsT8V72" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1Dvd7Wb72JBTbAcfTrxSJCZZuf4tsT8V72</a><br />
It seems that this adress has only received one single transaction for 0.28847409 BTC.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if this is the real BTC address of the scam or not.<br />
If it is the real BTC adress, then then scam went no where.<br />
On the otherhand, I came to another conclusion, let say you want to compromise a BTC transaction. You start a sextortion scam spam and mention the BTC address that you want to compromise mentionned in the scam email. And afterwards, you will get a bunch of angry hackers starting to look for the personns involved in using that money.</p>

				<p>I got one of these, too. Actually, I found it in my spam box, and it was two weeks old already. The password appears to be from ubuntuforums.org, which I haven&#8217;t visited in five years.</p>
<p>The tracking pixel idea is interesting. It could theoretically be true even if there is no video. As far as I can tell from the email source, there is none, and if there were, it wouldn&#8217;t be activated in spam view anyway.</p>

				<p>I just received a similar email however it came from one of my pop own email accounts. Thereby creating a more authentic scam.</p>
<p>See below:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!<br />
I&#8217;m a member of an international hacker group.</p>
<p>As you could probably have guessed, your account&#8212;-@&#8212;- was hacked, I sent message you from it.</p>
<p>Now I have access to you accounts! You still do not believe it?<br />
So, this is your password: ******** , right?</p>
<p>Within a period from July 5, 2018 to September 21, 2018, you were infected by the virus we&#8217;ve created, through an adult website you&#8217;ve visited.<br />
So far, we have access to your messages, social media accounts, and messengers.<br />
Moreover, we&#8217;ve gotten full damps of these data.</p>
<p>We are aware of your little and big secrets&#8230;yeah, you do have them. We saw and recorded your doings on porn websites. Your tastes are so weird, you know..</p>
<p>But the key thing is that sometimes we recorded you with your webcam, syncing the recordings with what you watched!<br />
I think you are not interested show this video to your friends, relatives, and your intimate one&#8230;</p>
<p>Transfer $700 to our Bitcoin wallet: 1DzM9y4fRgWqpZZCsvf5Rx4HupbE5Q5r4y<br />
I guarantee that after that, we&#8217;ll erase all your &#8220;data&#8221; 😀</p>
<p>A timer will start once you read this message. You have 48 hours to pay the above-mentioned amount.</p>
<p>Your data will be erased once the money are transferred.<br />
If they are not, all your messages and videos recorded will be automatically sent to all your contacts found on your devices at the moment of infection.</p>
<p>You should always think about your security. We hope this case will teach you to keep secrets.<br />
Take care of yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any veracity to this variation of the extortion scheme?</p>
<p>Thx!</p>

				<p>So, I got the same email too. However, the password was wrong &#8211; it was a password I used on sites I thought were fairly unimportant so I am not sure which website it might be from. I am not sure how I got sent the email with the from address being my email.</p>
<p>I did change the email password and removed apps with access. I also turned on 2-step verification. Anything else to do?</p>

				<p>Seen about 50+ of these copycat emails (all base64 encoded), and just got a couple new iterations (not base64 encoded). I love how a general theme is &#8220;we caught you masturbating on your webcam lololol.&#8221; Never mind the fact that some computers just don&#8217;t have a webcam…</p>
<p>#1, sent strictly in plaintext (italicization is masked data)</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>From:</strong> &lt;<em><a href="mailto:user@domain.com">user@domain.com</a></em>&gt;<br />
<strong>To:</strong> &#8220;<em>password</em>&#8221; &lt;<em><a href="mailto:user@domain.com">user@domain.com</a></em>&gt;<br />
<strong>Subject:</strong> Delete Message After Reading!<br />
<br />
Hi, dear user of <em>domain.com</em><br />
We have installed one RAT software into you device.<br />
For this moment your email account is hacked (see on &lt;from address&gt;, I messaged you from your account).<br />
Your password for <em><a href="mailto:user@domain.com">user@domain.com</a></em>: <em>password</em><br />
<br />
I have downloaded all confidential information from your system and I got some more evidence.<br />
The most interesting moment that I have discovered are videos records where you masturbating.<br />
<br />
I posted my virus on porn site, and then you installed it on your operation system.<br />
When you clicked the button Play on porn video, at that moment my trojan was downloaded to your device.<br />
After installation, your front camera shoots video every time you masturbate, in addition, the software is synchronized with the video you choose.<br />
<br />
For the moment, the software has collected all your contact information from social networks and email addresses.<br />
If you need to erase all of your collected data, send me $800 in BTC (crypto currency).<br />
This is my Bitcoin wallet: <em>random_bitcoin_address</em><br />
You have 48 hours after reading this letter.<br />
<br />
After your transaction I will erase all your data.<br />
Otherwise, I will send video with your pranks to all your colleagues and friends!!!<br />
<br />
And henceforth be more careful!<br />
Please visit only secure sites!<br />
Bye!
</p></blockquote>
<p>#2, sent in both plaintext &amp; HTML (italicization is masked data)</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>From:</strong> &#8220;qVvMgvU&#8221; &lt;Florian@8484y.com&gt;<br />
<strong>To:</strong> &lt;<em><a href="mailto:user@domain.com">user@domain.com</a></em>&gt;<br />
<strong>Subject:</strong> Your life can be ruined,concentrate.<br />
<br />
Hi, my sacrifice.<br />
<br />
I write you because I put a virus on the web page with porno which you have viewed.<br />
My malware captured all your private info and switched on your web camera which recorded the process of your masturbation. Just after that the soft saved your contact list.<br />
I will erase the compromising video and data if you pay me 400 EURO in bitcoin. This is wallet address for payment : <em>random_bitcoin_address</em><br />
<br />
I give you 30h after you view my message for making the transaction.<br />
As soon as you view the message I&#8217;ll see it right away.<br />
It is not necessary to tell me that you have paid to me. This wallet address is connected to you, my system will delete everything automatically after transfer confirmation.<br />
If you need 50h just answer on this letter with +.<br />
You can visit the police station but anyone can&#8217;t help you.<br />
If you try to cheat me , I&#8217;ll see it right away!<br />
I don&#8217;t live in your country. So no one can&#8217;t track my location even for 9 months.<br />
bye. Don&#8217;t forget about the disgrace and to ignore, Your life can be destroyed.

				<p>@Randon Parker, (CJ)</p>
<p><i>”… However, the password was wrong …”</i><br />
OK, so i get it was not the pwd of your existing email account. Good.</p>
<p><i>”… I am not sure how I got sent the email with the from address being my email.”</i><br />
I’m not deep in that stuff, but the visible “From” field has absolutely no real value, it is only used for display purposes. What it displays is part of the email’s message (the content / body), the sender may fill in there whatever they want.<br />
See also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing</a></p>
<p>Basically all “values” in an email, like with snail mail, can be determined by the sender (but restrictions from the sender’s service provider may apply).<br />

				<p>Yeah I&#8217;ve just got one. Went on have I been pwend and it&#8217;s shown me several websites that my email is linked to that have been compromised in some way showing they have given out passwords and email details. So you might want to check on there for accounts you might have and need to change. Mine went as</p>
<p>&#8220;obolesonnn@backroads.net</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a programmer who cracked your email and device a few months ago.<br />
You entered a pass on one of the sites you visited, and I intercepted it.<br />
This is your password from ***** on moment of hack: *****</p>
<p>Of course you can will change it, or already changed it.<br />
But it doesn&#8217;t matter, my malware updated it every time.</p>
<p>Do not try to contact me or find me, it is impossible (in &#8216;from address&#8217; is a random contact).</p>
<p>Through your email, I uploaded malicious code to your Operation System.<br />
I saved all of your contacts with friends, colleagues, relatives and a complete history of visits to the Internet resources.<br />
Also I installed a Trojan on your device and long tome spying for you.</p>
<p>You are not my only victim, I usually lock computers and ask for a ransom.<br />
But I was struck by the sites of intimate content that you often visit.</p>
<p>I am in shock of your fantasies! I&#8217;ve never seen anything like this!</p>
<p>So, when you had fun on piquant sites (you know what I mean!)<br />
I made screenshot with using my program from your camera of yours device.<br />
After that, I combined them to the content of the currently viewed site.</p>
<p>There will be laughter when I send these photos to your contacts!<br />
BUT I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t want it.</p>
<p>Therefore, I expect payment from you for my silence.<br />
I think $857 is an acceptable price for it!</p>
<p>Pay via Bitcoin.<br />
My BTC wallet: 1LZQGS99RUCvQvT5Qce7LkrWtMtcXPSdWZ</p>
<p>If you do not know how to do this &#8211; enter into Google &#8220;how to transfer money to a bitcoin wallet&#8221;. It is not difficult.<br />
After receiving the specified amount, all your data will be immediately destroyed automatically. My virus will also remove itself from your operating system.</p>
<p>My Trojan have auto alert, after this email is read, I will be know it!</p>
<p>I give you 2 days (48 hours) to make a payment.<br />
If this does not happen &#8211; all your contacts will get crazy shots from your dark secret life!<br />
And so that you do not obstruct, your device will be blocked (also after 48 hours)</p>
<p>Do not be silly!<br />
Police or friends won&#8217;t help you for sure &#8230;</p>
<p>p.s. I can give you advice for the future. Do not enter your passwords on unsafe sites.</p>
<p>I hope for your prudence.<br />
Farewell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interesting they have changed the wording to device now, more likely to pull people in compared to laptop. I doubt I have a Trojan on my phone considering I&#8217;ve got a very new phone so I&#8217;m skeptical that they will know I&#8217;ve looked at the email from that way. I wonder what they class as weird fantasy. Lol</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve received a similar email, which my email service classified as spam so it was in my <strong>spam</strong> folder, but the password associated with the service that used that email address was only mostly correct. All of the alphanumeric characters were correct, but all of the letters were lowercase, where in the actual password some of those letters were uppercase. There were also some <em>special characters</em>, of the <strong>!@#</strong> kind, that were missing. The only password I remember is for the password manager I use which creates a different password for every entry. I also use a different email address for every service I use.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m here to say that I got this email and the hack definitely wasn&#8217;t from Linkedin. It was from either youtube or google. That is the only place I use that password. So it looks like something hasn&#8217;t been revealed yet as far as leaks and hacks. I didn&#8217;t realise I had a google account, I made a youtube account and found out later they were the same thing. So youtube (or google accounts) have had a data breach somehow.</p>
<p>I have been pwned but not with those details that like I said, I only use on youtube and my compromised one that showed up has been changed. Never had a Linkedin account.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually really scary and I feel sorry for people who are not paranoid like me and cover their webcam permanently with a sticker. The worst part is you don&#8217;t have time to think and will panic. Anyway mines was in my spam folder so it was only by luck I saw it before it got deleted. I&#8217;m not entirely sure they should be putting this in the spam folder if it has real email addresses that can alert you that your account is compromised but I suppose it&#8217;s to stop people falling for it. I did read about this in the news this week so thanks to them for informing us all so we can be more prepared.</p>

				<p>Can&#8217;t edit, that&#8217;s meant to say if it has *real passwords (not emails). And particularly if the emails match the passwords which for half of the stories I&#8217;ve read they do, and some they don&#8217;t or there are only partial passwords. Still not good enough that these details have got out there and into strangers hands. How? The fact that we have heard no data breach from youtube or google means that the scam is even more likely to work as people won&#8217;t know how else they got their secret details. Do you think the police would take action or be able to find the people trying the extortion or not?</p>

				<p>With this scam, I wanted to answer but I suspect the e-mail return address was faked and there was no way to really answer. BUt here&#8217;s what I would have said:</p>
<p>Dear Tobias (that was the name used):</p>
<p>I am very upset that you have not kept up your end of the bargain. You offered to send out videos to my 5 contacts, if I didn&#8217;t pay, and I haven&#8217;t, but you haven&#8217;t either. What kind of business relationship is this?</p>
<p>Tiffany, Crystal, Heather, Amber, and Sid have all been looking forward to this video. (Please don&#8217;t pass judgment on Sid.. he&#8217;s been going through a bit of an identity crisis lately and is still sorting things out.)</p>
<p>Anyways, I look forward to your active response.</p>
