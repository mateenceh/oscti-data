				<p>My to-do list is much more ordinary than this. Wash dishes, write up complaints, bring down the establishment, buy milk and cigarettes.</p>
<p>Hang on. That&#8217;s not a work list, Bruce. That&#8217;s a list of holiday destinations! The closest I get to a slap up conferance and a holiday is walking back through the park after buying fish and chips.</p>
<p>Nice hat!</p>

				<p>What is it about terrorism that makes you approach and write about the issue with such rationality and about information security that sees you routinely share movie plot articles and title your book to stoke the hyperbole in our industry?</p>

				<p>If it&#8217;s Thursday, it must be Stockholm&#8230; Ouch!</p>
<p>I began writing a bit of Octave code to figure out what distance will be traveled, and perhaps resuscitate a simulated annealing TSP snippet of code I wrote decades ago to optimize the order of cities visited. As I was coding the function for calculating the distance from the long/lat differences, it occurred to me that I could just open Gurgle Maps and go <a href="https://ibb.co/dinX5K" rel="nofollow ugc">click-a-clickety-click</a>.</p>
<p>So: only stopping at the various stages without going home, and flying as the crow flies [<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/08/cheating_in_bir.html#c6780930" rel="nofollow ugc">second time in two days I use this expression</a>], is about 75 thousand kilometers in 3 months, or nearly twice around the world, setting off from, and returning to, Minneapolis. Nearly twice the earth&#8217;s circumference, or in practice much more considering.</p>
<p>I feel dizzy. Can&#8217;t say I like flying (in all, boarded 4 different aircrafts in the last decade), and I would feel bad about the carbon footprint.</p>
<p>The venue in Berlin is the former seat of the central committee of the East German Communist party (its actual name was somewhat more complicated name), where the &#8220;real&#8221; decisions were taken, and an annual &#8220;parliament&#8221; was held at a multi-purpose conference hall across the street (that particular construction is currently being replaced by a faux-baroque building trying to pretend that history didn&#8217;t happen). It was portrayed on <a href="https://cdn.mdr.de/damals/archiv/bild140360-resimage_v-variantBig1xN_w-1280.jpg?version=24908" rel="nofollow ugc">GDR bank notes</a>. I was somewhat miffed about the idea of a frigging business school taking over the building, but to see one infallible orthodoxy being replaced by another one is in retrospect an absolute, albeit involuntary, stroke of genius. The GDR&#8217;s contradictions were torpedoed by just a few words: &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZiAxgYY75Y" rel="nofollow ugc">ab sofort, unverzüglich</a>&#8220;. Which will be the ones that will sink &#8220;our&#8221; own system?</p>

				<blockquote><p>Stay hydrated Bruce.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yea! And eat a banana too. Then move out of your chair once every hour or two[1] so you don&#8217;t get a blood clot. Also sit in the front of the plane so you don&#8217;t sniff kerosene fumes out of the engines 😉 Also don&#8217;t let them put ice in whatever you drink. Ice on planes is full of bacteria. Oh, and whatever you do, don&#8217;t scrible any equations or Security things on paper while in flight. Definitely no &#8220;Movie-Plot Threat Contest&#8221; preparations on the flight or at the airport.[2]</p>
<p>And restore your <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/05/economist_detai.html#c6723725" rel="nofollow ugc">original passphrase</a></p>
<p>Umm&#8230;  that&#8217;s all I have to say about that!</p>
<p>[1] But since you sleep on planes&#8230; Sleepwalking is acceptable too.</p>
<p>[2] You might want to opt out of the nudie machine at the airport and go for the &#8220;hand patting&#8221;. Last time they asked me why I opted out (before I had TSA precheck) and I said I want a free massage, dawg, here: use this oil please. It didn&#8217;t go well for me, but you being who you are&#8230; your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>To my surprise it seems that Mike has a point:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is it about terrorism that makes you approach and write about the issue with such rationality and about information security that sees you routinely share movie plot articles and title your book to stoke the hyperbole in our industry?</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Click Here to Kill Everybody&#8221; does certainly smell of clickbait.  (NO!, Click HERE on the clickbait.  If you click there you&#8217;ll kill EVERYONE)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s security theater gone Elizabethan:</p>

				<p>@ Tatütata,</p>
<blockquote><p>I feel dizzy. Can&#8217;t say I like flying (in all, boarded 4 different aircrafts in the last decade), and I would feel bad about the carbon footprint.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whilst carbon footprint is a &#8220;my place in society&#8221; concern, have you considered the &#8220;my personal risk&#8221; concern?</p>
<p>There is the travel to and from the airport, in some parts of the world that can include the extra risk of a free injection of lead (US, Brazil being two that have made repeated front page news).</p>
<p>Then there are the &#8220;flamen bomba&#8221; types crashing into the airport pedestrian area in a four by four with a bonfire in the back with a couple of barbeque gas cylinders. They picked the wrong airport and got a ball crushing defeat from a couple of itate would be travelers who had obviously worked out they were going to be delayed thus were trying to lower their stress induced high blood preasure. And who can blaim them high blood preasure is after all a &#8220;silent killer&#8221; as the idiots driving the bonfire would have known being medical types.</p>
<p>But airport strees comes out in other ways, no matter how innocent you are the checkin security process is going to cause a major hormone imbalence in the best of us. Apparently lowering your stress by black balling those brown shirts is very much verboten, so thats an extra stressor right there. How&#8217;s a person supposed to survive body, heart and soul that kind of dictitorial abuse.</p>
<p>Then of course there are the &#8220;body scanners&#8221; they claim the machines are safe, but they won&#8217;t let you or me adjust one and lock them in it for a year to prove they are not just fantasizing for all that profit they think they are going to make&#8230; But the simple fact is they are pumping radiant energy into you where there are no know safe limits just heating effect guesses&#8230;</p>
<p>But then there is the increased &#8220;space weather&#8221; particles/radiation you get &#8220;flying high&#8221; which is very likely to be cumulative for each air mile traveled, will you end up having had more stray than a lifetime of being medically imaged (hey those knee buckling lead aprons they all wear in cathlabs should give you cause to pause and think).</p>
<p>But you also have to worry about people with crotch or foot itch, are they another Captin Underpants or LCpl sabot with that little extra you realy don&#8217;t need. But they are by no means the worst, you need to ensure you are fully upto date on your all locations shots. Those tight fisted airlines want not just to poison you with increased levels of carbon dioxide and engine exhaust carcinogens, but a whole range of unknown virulent pathogens from your fellow travelers by turning the air extraction / replacment down to the absolute minimum they can get away with&#8230;</p>
<p>But there is also the problem of &#8220;straight and level&#8221; it&#8217;s no great secret that bits drop of aircraft, from door strips, through cargo doors to whole tail sails, and the odd jet engine. Mostly when the aircraft is not &#8220;straight and level&#8221;. So take off, landing, course correction, foul weather avoidence, oh and anti-collision avoidence. But when things do drop this often necessitates other quite sudden corrections to flight attitude, you can see where this is going, a kind of &#8220;chain reaction of doom&#8221; that techies prefer to call a &#8220;cascade failure&#8221; to try and make it sound safer and singular not a major &#8220;cluster f4ck&#8221; of rapid events caused by lax maintenence, poor design and friday afternoon and monday morning inattention.</p>
<p>But then there are cleaning staff blocking up pitot openings, causing all sorts of strange avionics effects&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh then there are meteorological effects, you should note they only give figures for &#8220;straight and level&#8221; not on the ground or near the ground such as take off and landing. You might also have heard of the &#8220;turkey tests&#8221; more formally &#8220;bird strike appraisal&#8221; take one frozen fowl, put it in the largest air gun you are ever likely to clap eyes on and fire it at places you think &#8220;might be vulnerable&#8221;. With the engines if you nip round the back you might get lucky and get freshly cooked turkey mince with considerable fortification of iron and other minerals, but not in a particularly soluble or edible for that matter form.</p>
<p>But you also have another stressor, the bus driver up front, the chances are they are on less than minimum wages, and indebt up to the eyeballs after self funding their training. They will of course start of at the bottom of the pile with all the stressful routes and times. It&#8217;s enough to drive a person to drink and drugs, and lets be honest quite a few do go down that route whilst others, well they just crack and go down and you with them&#8230;</p>
<p>But some are near &#8220;zero flight hours&#8221; trained in simulators, where you know your can just hit the replay button if you land inside a Spanish Mountain or some such. Speaking of which who actually flies the plane, the under trained lump of flesh up front or a bunch of software engineers with pizza and cola related ill health and never enough hours to be sure those little near invisable quote marks commas, semi colons, and colons are in the right places. Managment say you don&#8217;t have time for that, we pay you to cut code, we&#8217;ve software to test for crud in test&#8230; Run of course by those who can not make the lines cut count to be a programmer, even with the help of the Stackoverflow brains trust.</p>
<p>Then of course what&#8217;s under your seat? It might be incorrectly labled spare parts like oxygen makers or those whiz bank lithium batteries cooking down in the hold, burning through those &#8220;fly by wire&#8221; cables running just under the cabin floor.</p>
<p>I could go on, but is it any wonder that people take not just travel meds, but anti-anxiety and sleeping tablets&#8230; Have you ever wondered if various drug combinations and alcohol have ever been tested together? And what Jekyll and Hide effects they might have on the thin tails?</p>
<p>But do you dare sleep!!!, we all have heard about economy / cattle class DVT&#8217;s and other nasties. But even if you can sleep what about those who are fractious beyond normal, madening as they sometimes are, babies and children are disturbing/annoying more than they are dangerous but grown adults with a skinful or some mental disorder now they can hurt you with ease if you are asleep. Do you want to wake up with a plastic eating utensil ramed into an ear, nose, eye, or worse? Do you want to have your ear bitten off or your face scratched open, how about not waking up because you&#8217;ve been brained by the corner of a laptop some junior manager has lost it with and has had a major mental fritz out with? Hey don&#8217;t complain, it was only your head, not the window next to it they were actually aiming for. Your a hero your self sacrifice has stopped the rest of your fellow passengers getting dead by explosive decompression and it&#8217;s side effects like the Icarus one way effect, of dropping thirty thousand feet into mother earth.</p>
<p>How about those statistical oddities that say you are more likely to die a horrible death because there is a rock star on  the same flight?</p>
<p>But then are you on a connecting flight, did the person who had your seat leave a can of shaving lotion behind? And will you drop through the floor because of it? How about a laser printer in the hold being shipped for repair but with a realy wrong part in the tonner compartment?</p>
<p>That list just keeps on comming like the old films with stockmarket ticker tape machines&#8230;</p>
<p>@ Mike,</p>
<p>So nothing to worry or complain about at confrences then just hyperbole?</p>

<p>Bruce&#8217;s speaking engagement on that day will be in Harvard Square(1), which is certainly within his &#8220;home court&#8221; or &#8220;stomping grounds&#8221;.</p>

				<p>The discussion about the book title you point to is pretty haphazard.  But really, what is your point?</p>
<p>If your argument is: &#8220;If X talked about Y on Z.com before doing Y, members of Z.com should make no further comment?&#8221;, it doesn&#8217;t follow for me.  And most of the discussion you reference was negative anyhow and that did seemingly little to sway Bruce.</p>
<p>Not that it should.  It is his book, to take credit for or responsibility for.  We are the peanut gallery.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I am not railing against Bruce, just observing that it is hard to think of a more inflammatory and theatrical &#8220;popularization of security issues&#8221; title.  Not that it is easy to write such books, explaining an increasingly complicated area of effort to an increasingly less thoughtful audience.</p>

				<p>This topic was an interesting exercise in bystander syndrome. Another is by the time Bruce is ready for his flight he will be a nervous wreck!</p>
<p>@Faustus</p>
<p>The basic issue is the brain works at a heuristic level. Everything is connected to everything else including framing and biases, and perceptions, and social pressures. I&#8217;m trying to remember (and look up) the psych who was a contemporary of Freud who outlined the basics of this. Another way of putting things is people are the sum of their experiences.</p>
<p>@Clive</p>
<p>Airport security is another situation where men tend to be wired to attack men. If you area man don&#8217;t do anything stupid like fronting them up. If you&#8217;re a woman depending on location the general tilt of machismo and sex discrimination should be pretty obvious. No change there.</p>
<p>Sleep on the flight with your seatbelt on. This has a number of advantages:</p>
<p>A.) A relaxed body suffers less damage from impact.<br />
B.) None threat to conventional hijackers.<br />
C.) In case of catostrphic damage to airframe survivability is increased at 3,000 feet above wooded area.</p>
<p>You may also:</p>
<p>D. Wear sandles or zipped boots or sheos with shoelaces which won&#8217;t fall off so maintaining travel ability after impact.<br />
E.) Carry a minimal survival kit like needle and thread, a flint, and compass in a body pouch along with other valuables.<br />
F.) Wearan extra cardiagan instead of a blanket.</p>
<p>Just my amateur suggestions&#8230;</p>

<p>I was told when growing up (by the matriarch[1]) that &#8220;Cardigans are for those who need carers&#8221; meaning &#8220;children and the infirm&#8221; who could not get the buttons undone, thus did not annoy said carers.</p>
<p>[1] I should mention that she was quite happy spliting pigs heads in half with a meat cleaver, whilst leaving such wussy things as fowl decapitation to her youngest&#8230; To her a family pet would have been only for Christmas, and curry on new years day.</p>

<p>A cardigan avoids sexist arguing over what temperature the thermostat should be set too among other things I shouldn&#8217;t have to spell out to someone with your imagination and kenetic abilities. By the time we finish arguing cardigans will be standard issue for the SAS and replace half the junk they lug around!</p>

<p>Well, yes. Under none routine conditions the temperature needs to be dialed down otherwise men moan a lot more about temperature. This usually leaves me freezing sans cardigan. I could wear a cardigan but this would cause another argument. Thankfully motion in an enclosed space causes things to warm up, sometimes too much which is another argument.</p>
<p>I remember your &#8220;Russian beard&#8221; story. Due to coincidence as things turned out I had a mad panic for a minute as it sounded like we had met that week. (No joking!)  After checking all the details no we hadn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not sure whether I am disappointed or relieved. It was funny but ye gods what a fright.</p>
<p>I have noticed similar heat issues in retail premises. Latent heat, interior and exterior temperature differences and airflow, time of day, and body heat generated by activity, and exterior sun exposure and shade are a thing.</p>
<p>I also remember your cop story. They got a lot of perception and mechanical science wrong. Cops aren&#8217;t too bright at the best of times.</p>

<p>I also have an &#8220;office air con&#8221; story that involves cardigans, which I think I&#8217;ve told here a while ago, and I thought it was that you were remembering.</p>
<p>But with regards the great temprature divide, I&#8217;m one who likes it on what others describe as &#8220;Bl@@dy freezing 14&#8221; whilst I have worked in 50C when in the oil industry and when droping in on the Middle East for a stroll in the deasert I would not recommend it.</p>
<p>The worst temprature change I&#8217;ve had to put up with was from doing a job near the south pole in winter to being in the hotest part of the Middle East in summer for another job a few days later. It realy did feal like I&#8217;d become that proverbial &#8220;snow ball in hell&#8221;. I also got &#8220;Hotel Amnesia&#8221; which made the whole thing even more surreal.</p>

<p>I deleted part of that post before sending.  I had written (something like): I would even trade one nice statement about Trump for free ocean liner passage to Down Under and back.  I would not accept air fare under any circumstance because &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say I quit playing that hurry-up-and-wait travel game nearly 28 years ago and it has not aged well.</p>
<p>I learned about Zephyrometer less than one year before it got zapped.  The incident distressed me because I feared it spelled the end of the art project/science demo.  I saw close-up photos of the split needle cum raw fiberglass; the thing was toast.  (Only later did the sculptor commit to a rework.)</p>
<p>As it happens, the first I ever heard &#8220;stuffed&#8221; (i.e. ruined) it was uttered by a Brit.  I remember because he pronounced &#8220;stuffed&#8221;, &#8220;stoofed&#8221;.  But I guess the grass is always greener &#8230;  🙂</p>
<p>I imagine a disdainful Crocodile Dundee: &#8220;THAT&#8217;S not stuffed; THIS is stuffed.&#8221;</p>

17 Times The English Language Was Absolutely Ridiculous</p>
<p>I dislike poncy weasle words too but also dislike banality. Nobody is intelligent and classy any more.</p>
<p>@Clive</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t remember that one.</p>
<p>On and off I have been watching videos in the prepper, EDC, and survivival domains. It&#8217;s what is on youtube and how they pitch things. I mostly stick with the sane stuff. I have watched videos about different terrains. Only the other month I had chats ex Royal Marines (what is it with military men behaving like buses). It&#8217;s easy to forget how quickly artic water can kill. Watching a US video on body warming and cooling down techniques using the hands as a heat exchanger was good. I tell people about this technique but nobody believes me. (Sexists!) I also watched a Ray Mears desert survival video last week. This was one of his more interesting shows.</p>
<p>I like living in a country with seasons. I&#8217;m eclectic so different clothes for different seasons and places keeps me entertained.</p>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m eclectic so different clothes for different seasons and places keeps me entertained.</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking of clothes, you might be old enough to remember Blakes7 with it&#8217;s wonky wobbly sets and Leeds Poly buildings. Well the highlight of each show for many was what piece of glamour was the BBC costume Dept going to find for Servalan to wear. Clothes just loved her figure and her almost elfin face large brown eyes and short dark hair, and her ability to walk in a way that had an easy grace and poise. It was a form of &#8220;Power Dressing&#8221; befor the term was coined.</p>
<p>Sadly Jacqueline Pearce who so exquisitely played Servalan died yesterday.</p>
<p>Brought up in a convent school in West Byfleet near Woking in Surrey, she developed a sense of humour that her friends called &#8220;fun and filthy&#8221;. She once shocked a journalist interviewing her about her Blakes7 role by bluntly stating how she thought many had used images of her charecter for their fantasies.</p>

				<p>Sad that you&#8217;ll be in the area, but I can&#8217;t afford to attend.</p>
<p>Oh well, I guess I&#8217;ll just stay here and read the wisdom you give away for free.</p>
