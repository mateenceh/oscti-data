		<h2 class="entry">Security Vulnerabilities in US Weapons Systems</h2>
		<p>The US Government Accounting Office <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-19-128">just published</a> a new report: &#8220;<a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694913.pdf">Weapons Systems Cyber Security: DOD Just Beginning to Grapple with Scale of Vulnerabilities</a>&#8221; (summary <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694914.pdf">here</a>). The upshot won&#8217;t be a surprise to any of my regular readers: they&#8217;re vulnerable. </p>
<p>From the summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>Automation and connectivity are fundamental enablers of DOD&#8217;s modern military capabilities. However, they make weapon systems more vulnerable to cyber attacks. Although GAO and others have warned of cyber risks for decades, until recently, DOD did not prioritize weapon systems cybersecurity. Finally, DOD is still determining how best to address weapon systems cybersecurity.</p>
<p>In operational testing, DOD routinely found mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities in systems that were under development, yet program officials GAO met with believed their systems were secure and discounted some test results as unrealistic. Using relatively simple tools and techniques, testers were able to take control of systems and largely operate undetected, due in part to basic issues such as poor password management and unencrypted communications. In addition, vulnerabilities that DOD is aware of likely represent a fraction of total vulnerabilities due to testing limitations. For example, not all programs have been tested and tests do not reflect the full range of threats.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is definitely easier, and cheaper, to ignore the problem or pretend it isn&#8217;t a big deal. But that&#8217;s probably a mistake in the long run.</p>

				<p>From personal knowledge, I can attest that Global Strike Command (yes, that&#8217;s what they call it &#8230; used to be called SAC), the arm of the US Air Force responsible for its nuclear arsenal, has been investing in a cybersecurity program for more than 5 years.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not in a position to evaluate how thorough or effective that initiative has been.  Given the nature of its responsibilities, it&#8217;s logical and appropriate that Global Strike has been proactive about information security, and perhaps is &#8220;out in front&#8221; of other segments of the US military.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I&#8217;m very confident that &#8220;the ultimate weapon&#8221; is not connected to the public internet.  However, the assets and facilities of this Command are vast and sprawling, with many possibilities for vulnerability not directly connected with command and control of nuclear weapons.</p>

				<p><i><b><a href="http://sel4.systems" rel="nofollow ugc">http://sel4.systems</a></b> &#8211; The world&#8217;s first operating-system kernel with an end-to-end proof of implementation correctness and security enforcement is available as open source.</i></p>
<p>This sort of thing sounds like the answer to this sort of problem. Open source with a mathematical proof of correctness of the implementation.</p>
<p><b>Do these people have competitors?</b> I do not believe in &#8220;first&#8221; and &#8220;only&#8221; or in the no-bid govt contracts for which US//Israeli MIC is notorious.</p>
<p>Obviously the prevailing culture of &#8220;proprietary&#8221; and/or &#8220;classified&#8221; software is inherently hostile to the idea of open source, provably correct software solutions to address security problems.</p>
<p>No response but stone silence from &#8220;the biz&#8221; and no one &#8220;in the know&#8221; wants to discuss the idea of mathematical proof as it relates to security-critical computer software anywhere.</p>

				<p>@Little Lamb don’t forget that the military is still a customer and most certainly, as everyone ever, prioritizes features over security.</p>
<p>It’s just human nature. I’d even argue that, depending on the particular situation, may not even be wrong..</p>

				<p>The classified systems I&#8217;ve worked on have been air-gapped and on separate networks.  (Of course, the systems attacked by Stuxnet were air-gapped and on separate networks, too.)  Some of the systems were designed to be relatively high performance on low-end hardware but were completely un-networked or on a backplane system and thus had no security.  Well, other than the men and women with M-4 rifles firing 5.56 mm ammunition.</p>

<p>Yes, and attacking the centrifuges in Iran required recruiting an asset to deliver the malware to the facility on a USB drive&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s not magic.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if computers are connected to the network or not if someone can access the hardware</p>

<p>Thanks Captain Obvious, SIPRNET and JWICs aren&#8217;t connected to the public internet either, what&#8217;s your point?</p>
<p>Like that somehow makes them anymore secure.</p>
<p>Any network and communications system can be exploited</p>

				<p>@Warren</p>
<p><i>why are they (sel4.systems) serving over http and not https?</i></p>
<p>Good question. Even farmers have https these days. <a href="https://chicken.coop/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://chicken.coop/</a></p>
<p>They might have problems with low-level tech staff at the commercial ssl cert shops who (A) fear competition in the security biz on behalf of their bosses, and (B) play dumb with the unusual top-level domain.</p>
<p>They appear to be publishing general information on an open source project. An analogy is that a newspaper publishing company is usually satisfied with low to moderate security on the lock-box coin-op vending machines, and only marginally concerned with their security as such.</p>
<p>They are on GitHub as well, which does serve over https. <a href="https://github.com/seL4" rel="nofollow ugc">https://github.com/seL4</a> although there are plenty of human factors to computer security there which are not subject to mathematical proof.</p>

				<p>@ Little Lamb,</p>
<blockquote><p>This sort of thing sounds like the answer to this sort of problem. Open source with a mathematical proof of correctness of the implementation.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not a proof of security.</p>
<p>To understand this you have to understand that the proof is &#8220;top down&#8221; to the CPU ISA at best. It can not for instance stop variations on RowHammer and many other &#8220;bubbling up&#8221; attacks from below the CPU ISA level in the computing stack.</p>
<p>There are partial at best solutions to bubbling up attacks but they require quite extensive hardware that is a couple of orders over &#8220;memory parity&#8221; or even &#8220;memory tagging&#8221; (look at CHERI over at Cambridge for instance the &#8220;capabilities&#8221; are not bubbling up proof),</p>

				<p><i>variations on RowHammer and many other &#8220;bubbling up&#8221; attacks from below the CPU ISA level in the computing stack</i></p>
<p>It is still a very interesting methodology, and there is no reason it cannot be rolled out at the chip fab design level as well as the O/S level, assuming the mathematical proof part is legit and proves what it claims to prove.</p>
<p>To paraphrase the claim: <i>&#8220;I can prove mathematically that I did my job correctly, and my implementation of a basic O/S performs correctly assuming the CPU performs as documented.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This is still a significant claim which is not at all invalidated by RowHammer-level issues.</p>
<p>Of course &#8220;security&#8221; in general involves human and human-interface issues which are not subject to mathematical proof, so there is no danger of putting Bruce and colleagues out of work.</p>

				<p>To my previous question about competition to seL4, I would tend to think on the order of GNU Hurd.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html</a></p>
<p>This one is probably on a more advanced ready-for-market level, as it appears that the &#8220;Debian&#8221; distribution has been more or less successfully ported from Linux to the Hurd.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/</a></p>
<p>The Hurd actually runs on the Mach microkernel</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/microkernel/mach/gnumach.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/microkernel/mach/gnumach.html</a></p>
<p>So another possibility would be to port the Hurd from Mach to seL4 to take advantage of its mathematical proof of correctness. (Or one might even consider porting the proof mechanisms from seL4 to Mach.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hurd&#8221; as such is intended to fill the gap between the Mach microkernel and what a monolithic kernel such as Linux (or, say, BSD) provides, and to mitigate and alleviate the &#8220;monolith&#8221; problems that lead to so much cursing and swearing on the lkml.org lists, (&#8220;the tangled webs we weave,&#8221; etc.)</p>

<blockquote><p><i>To paraphrase the claim: &#8220;I can prove mathematically that I did my job correctly, and my implementation of a basic O/S performs correctly <b>assuming the CPU performs as documented.</b>&#8220;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>That &#8220;assumption&#8221; is the deal breaker. All attacks below the CPU ISA level invalidates the statment. You can not make those assumptions at all ever.</p>
<p>The big problem is that the computing stack in reality goes all the way down to quantum physics. Thus there will always be a layer below that you can apply your theorm checkers[1].</p>
<p>If you search back in this blog you will find @RobertT explained in some detail to @Nick P and others how you could do this in a way that few would ever be capable of finding&#8230;</p>
<p>Digging down the computing stack gets exponentially more expensive and essentially pointless.</p>
<p>The solution is to work out how to mitigate any implant be it hardware or software.</p>
<p>For instance lets assume an implant will working below the CPU at the RAM level or lower can be used to read out any part of the RAM contents across the network. There is nothing you can do in software to stop this. What you can do however is put a hardware encryptor inside the CPU chip at the address and data bus level that encrypts the RAM. Provided the KeyMat never gets copied to RAM then that implant and all others in the same class of attack are mitigated. However whilst that stops a below CPU ISA implant it does not stop an implant at or above the CPU ISA.</p>
<p>[1] Without going into it again within a week, all systems are made of component parts. These parts need to reach a certain degree of complexity to be secure, below that level they are not secure. It can be shown that you can make an implant that will work with less complexity than is required to be secure&#8230;</p>

<p>Granted, you do need to fix the instruction-set level problems in the hardware, but don&#8217;t let that slow down the O/S work or be a deal-breaker.</p>
<p>Where is the open-source hardware design? A &#8220;corner-cutting&#8221; choice was made somewhere along the line to sacrifice some integrity and correctness for speed and performance. Just back off a little bit from that surgical scalpel at the &#8220;cutting edge&#8221; of medicine.</p>
<p>Most CPUs on the market (if they are not wildly overclocked) execute instructions &#8220;well enough&#8221; to bootstrap a provably correct O/S even if all their chip-level logic is not </i><i>provably</i> correct or even open-source at this point.</p>

				<p>Back in the day, when missile (not hittile) systems were tipped with thermonuclear MRV&#8217;s and their control systems were under exploration, lots of 68000 (6502/6809/29000) CMOS boards (and others like the Z800, or custom PAL&#8217;s) and other evaluation/development kits&#8211;hardware layer software (linear programming and binhex) was the most common off-the-shelf choice for developers. How many developers uploaded code using standard out to a simple binary (BCD) stream? We just needed to get the die RAD hard or MilSpec&#8217;d so we can ship it&#8230;</p>
<p>Boards (prototypes and production) had everything from terminal serial ports, one or more JTAG ports, or some other debugger (ICE like) left pinned, enabled, with a nice header. One chap that had worked on early FPGA&#8217;s that was responsible for a platform design where he described the security profile of a Xilinx system&#8211;he hadn&#8217;t realized that the tools to provide the runtime level security had to be implemented. The assumption had been that it came for free (did its own LUT and cryptographic assemble somehow?). I just walked away, this kind of problem would only be resolved when the next generation (or upgrade) of these systems. Just keep the old fingers crossed and hope for the best.</p>

				<p>Not long ago I sat in on a project meeting (avionic/flight) control system where the design team decided early on (the classic example of the tool defining the design, not the design driving the tools) a systems platform that was to be based on a RT-Java implementation on a separation kernel platform. Does not matter that the system was EAL-?, the runtime behavior was not completely deterministic (non-profiled code, and JIT is not an excuse) as platform changes would be script level (several orders of magnitude away from the platform performance domain).</p>
<p>Again, walk away&#8211;make sure you are looking at everyone even if you have to go out the door with your back to the door. Don&#8217;t break eye contact until the exit can be reached.</p>

				<p>@Nixon:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s happened before on this forum, that folks made silly assumptions concerning systems they didn&#8217;t know much about.</p>
<p>I stated the obvious, in the faint hope of forestalling such nonsense.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>Captain Obvious</p>
<hr />
<p>The presence or absence of a public internet connection is significant, insofar as it determines the types of attack, required physical access, and specific hardware (and other capabilities) required to take control of a target system.</p>
<p>Some whiz-bang upgrade may break all of this, but at least until recently, nobody sitting in the comfort of their office or home had the capacity to command the unauthorized launch of a US long-range nuclear ballistic missile.</p>
<hr />
<p>Stuxnet offers a useful example.  When a target system has sufficiently limited external communication, &#8220;cyber&#8221; attacks may require physical access.</p>
<p>The penetrations in Iran, as I understand the matter, reflected multiple failures to secure physical access and to control personnel with sensitive access.</p>
<p>Physical security is hard, and really costly, but if done thoroughly it won&#8217;t be defeated by a remote attacker, or without the breach becoming evident.</p>
<p>The folks who manage the US strategic nuclear arsenal have a lot of experience maintaining physical security, and an ample budget to fund it.  I&#8217;ve seen some of their safeguards up close &#8230; they may seem almost comically extreme, but have the effect of rendering unauthorized access &#8212; at least, certain types of access &#8212; practically unachievable.</p>

				<p>@ Little Lamb,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; but don&#8217;t let that slow down the O/S work or be a deal-breaker.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t want it to slow down &#8220;correct&#8221; software development.</p>
<p>The problem is that it&#8217;s not just &#8220;go for the burn&#8221; hardware development it&#8217;s become &#8220;shot down in flames&#8221; hardware development.</p>
<p>And like it or not as I indicated what happens on one side of the CPU ISA level does effect the other side of the CPU ISA layer.</p>
<p>Although it caused a bit of an argument on this blog at the time, the hardware issues with RowHammer were known at the time it became public and had been known since before DRAM realy got going with 8bit computer chips. Likewise the hardware issies with Meltdown and Spector were not unexpected in general, because some one had already shown that the addressing logic inside x86 CPU&#8217;s had become &#8220;Turing compleate&#8221;,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot13/woot13-bangert.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot13/woot13-bangert.pdf</a></p>
<p>If you look in the papers refrences you will find that the academic community were aware of what they had started to call &#8220;Weird Machines&#8221; since 2009.</p>
<p>Likewise this quite readable paper from the UK&#8217;s Cambridge Computer Labs,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sd601/papers/mov.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sd601/papers/mov.pdf</a></p>
<p>Show that the roots of &#8220;weird machines&#8221; and &#8220;Single instruction Turing compleat engines&#8221; goes back to befor the late 1980&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The discovery of Meltdown and Spector were just extensions of this. In essence the knowledge that they existed went back atleast a year or two before then but developing the Proof of Concept code fell to others who had more time on their hands &#8220;to play&#8221;.</p>
<p>There is an awful lot wrong below the CPU ISA level and as I&#8217;ve said often on this blog &#8220;this is the Xmas gift that is just going to keep giving&#8221;.</p>
<p>The fact that what are &#8220;weird machines&#8221; has been, not just known about but taught since the late 1980&#8217;s, idicates very very strongly that not just Intel but other CPU designers were well aware of the below CPU problems and were for some reason ignoring it. It might well have something to do with &#8220;Managment &amp; Marketing&#8217;s&#8221; desire for &#8220;Specmanship&#8221; or any one of many other sins.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s finaly in the more general mindset more and more young researchers are going to &#8220;dig, dig, dig for glory&#8221; below the CPU ISA and CPU levels. And I would say in the majority of cases that they will have major and complratly unavoidable effects on anything above the CPU ISA level.</p>
<p>Thus what we realy need is not a top down or bottom up &#8220;proof&#8221; system but a &#8220;meet in the middle&#8221; proof system, which currently we realy do not have.</p>
<p>Oh and just to reiterate the &#8220;complexity&#8221; point. To catch or trap &#8220;bubbling up&#8221; attacks needs more complicated hardware to check that the Core Memory contains the values put in it by the &#8220;top down&#8221; provably correct methods tagging alone is not sufficient in the same way as &#8220;parity checking&#8221; RAM is insufficient. This involves a lot of extra complexity, and as we know more complexity often means increased attack surface.</p>
<p>However as I point out from time to time &#8220;security needs a certain level of complexity to be possible&#8221; and currently we don&#8217;t have that type of complexity below the CPU level we need.</p>
<p>One almost immediate solution that could be implemented is to take &#8220;critical functionality&#8221; like MMU, Interupt and similar tables out of Core Memory and give them entirely seperate &#8220;privileged access only&#8221; memory inside the CPU chip. However this has the downside that it would not work with &#8220;multiple CPU chip&#8221; systems. Thus you need entirely seperate external memory that does not share the Core Memory pins or logic which would be an unacceptable overhead on single CPU chip systems which are still by far the majority of machines. Which illistrates the issues and trade offs that have to be considered and chosen.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why in the past I&#8217;ve looked at an entirely different way to mitigate the problem.</p>

				</p>

				<p>Some more ruminations on the security of long-range nuclear ballistic missiles against unauthorized launch &#8230;</p>
<p>[Disclaimer:  because much about the relevant systems is (not surprisingly) secret, my knowledge is fragmentary; because they are frequently upgraded, it may also be out-of-date.]</p>
<p>When the command and control architecture for US strategic nuclear missiles was designed, there were grown-ups in the room.  They realized that the danger of unauthorized launch was vastly greater than the danger of failure to launch.  (An unauthorized launch could, in itself, precipitate the end of civilization; a failure to launch would minutely alter a destruction of civilization that was already underway.)</p>
<p>Accordingly, the design of the US C<sup>3</sup> (command, control, communications) system has always been designed so that the <i>negative controls</i> (inhibiting launch) are much stronger than the <i>positive controls</i> (authorizing launch).</p>
<p>The architecture assumes that an attacker (in the cyber-security sense of that term) may inject messages at any point, and provides a variety of cryptographic safeguards to protect against such attacks.</p>
<p>Though the architecture and some of the infrastructure are very old, this isn&#8217;t really grandpa&#8217;s encryption, because the systems have been updated at intervals of not many years.</p>
<p>I suppose the worst-case attack would be based on exfiltration of the secret(s) contained in the notorious case (nicknamed &#8220;the football&#8221;) which is always kept handy to the US President.  In principle, a possessor of this secret information could then use one of the available communication channels (for example, a satellite link) to inject launch commands.</p>
<p>The generation and protection of &#8220;football&#8221; secrets is, of course, subject to the highest level of physical safeguards.  If unauthorized access to such secrets is discovered (with physical security, undetected access can be extremely difficult), the secrets can be promptly invalidated.  If you smuggle them out without discovery, the secrets are volatile, because they are changed at intervals of a few weeks.  Further, hacking into the command channels is probably a non-trivial challenge.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the question of negative controls.  A civilian investigator of the nuclear C<sup>3</sup> system has suggested that at a low alert level (the typical DEFCON 5 or even 4), the negative controls are so strong that even a fully authentic launch command originating from the actual POTUS would not be executed.</p>
<p>US nuclear missile launch might become automatic after a nuclear war had started, but under other conditions always keeps a &#8220;person in the loop.&#8221;  This precaution, far too costly for almost all other systems, renders many cyber-attack strategies infeasible.  [Note that almost all of those in-the-loop persons have negative authority, but can take no positive action on their own.]</p>
<p>Another level of attack for land-based missiles would be between the Launch Control Centers and the Launch Facilities (silos).  These don&#8217;t depend on the President&#8217;s &#8220;football,&#8221; because a launch command from an LCC is presumed to have been authenticated.  The secrets for the missiles themselves have a bit more shelf life, being updated annually.</p>
<p>Bruce Blair, a respected nuclear security analyst and himself a former Minuteman Launch Control Officer, has proposed that access to the buried cables is a soft spot in the system&#8217;s security.  Such an attack would require digging an access hole to the cable (there are tens of thousands of miles of them, and their routes are publicly known), most conveniently at a splice case, if you know where to find it.</p>
<p>Then you would need to open it up, identify the appropriate conductors, and break the electrical connections (presumably, without setting off any alarms).  With the right equipment, and knowledge of the right secrets (again, such secrets being subject to extreme physical security safeguards*) you could then send the commands needed to assign a missile target, and to launch against that target.</p>
<p>But if I understand correctly, you would really need to do this twice, simultaneously.  Minuteman is designed to launch immediately after receipt of two identical launch commands received via physically separate pathways.  Without the second redundant command, the missile commences an automatic 90 minute delay, and broadcasts by every available means of communication (there are several redundant channels), &#8220;I&#8217;m counting down to a launch without a verifying command.&#8221;  Hopefully, this situation would draw some appropriate attention.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Each missile has its own secret &#8220;key&#8221;, which is changed every year.</li>
</ul>

<p>blockquote&gt;under other conditions always keeps a &#8220;person in the loop.&#8221; /blockquote&gt;</p>
<p>This iirc, was one of the points raised against The Gypper&#8217;s SDI, that it effectively took out the &#8220;person in the loop&#8221; and was thus an even bigger threat than the risk of accidental nuclear war.</p>
<p>Seriously, I think the most dangerous security vulnerabilities would not be those in the Strategic Command, but those in the C<sup>3</sup> of the drone warriors, particularly if there are militarized drones operating in the metropolitan state itself. Just imagine, it&#8217;d be a SWATter&#8217;s wet dream. SWAT the LEA from the comfort of your own computer! Bring Drone War home to the Drone Warriors in the Capitol! Etc &#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>I suppose the worst-case attack would be based on exfiltration of the secret(s) contained in the notorious case (nicknamed &#8220;the football&#8221;) which is always kept handy to the US President.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not as much as you would think.</p>
<p>The design of the system from day one realised that the football was a very significant weak link in both directions.</p>
<p>Therefore there is another layer that will work even without the football but has to be used through the football.</p>
<p>It is rumored to be as simple as the Leslie Groves &#8220;random square&#8221; method of challenge and response.</p>
<p>Some have said that those in the &#8220;list&#8221; are given a plastic &#8220;snap card&#8221; with the random square in side it. The snap card is simply a more robust and tamper evident version of a sealed paper envelop kept in a safe.</p>
<p>In the UK for instance it&#8217;s fairly well known that one of the first duties a Prime Minister has is to write the &#8220;independent action letters&#8221; for the commanders of the UK nuclear deterrent that end up in sealed envelopes in the &#8220;commanders safe&#8221; on each submarine&#8221;. Tradition has it that these envelopes are never opened except under &#8220;conditions of war&#8221; and are thus destroyed unopened when the PM changes (it has been suggested they are actually kept at the National Archive near Kew under a &#8220;hundred year rule&#8221;).</p>
<p>Another thing that appears ammusing these days of mobile phone and instant Internet, is that there were arangments with not just the National Defence organisations but with the Automobile Association (AA) and Royal Automobile Club (RAC) to use their radio communications network to relay the launch command. Likewise the requirment that thr PM&#8217;s staff all carry atleast six penny pieces when away from Downing St / Whitehall such that the Post Office Telephones could br used without having to liase with an opperator.</p>
<p>But the funniest thing of all is the roll that &#8220;chickens&#8221; nearly played. In the early days of aircraft carried nuclear weapons in the 1950&#8217;s they were big around 7.3tons in a very large steel container. These were known as Blue Danube, but plans were made to also use them as land mines in Germany and this was code named Blue Peacock. The problem was the actuall physics packages were going to be kept in fairly deep holes for upto a week, in the ground in woodlands, forrests and river plains. However they had to be maintained at a temprature that was higher than would be expected (~57F) in such a deep hole. The solution some one suggested was &#8220;a chicken on a nest&#8221; heater. Apparently some scientist at Aldermastan worked out that a certain number of chickens inside the bomb case with sufficient grain and water would generate enough heat as well as survive for eight days in the hermetically sealed anti tamper device riddled bomb casing&#8230;</p>

				<p>One useful response to this problem, seems to be painfully obvious.</p>
<p>It could help to have a &#8220;red team&#8221; do their best to hack into each of these systems (in other words, conduct a penetration study).</p>
<p>And the Pentagon wouldn&#8217;t have to look far &#8230; the NSA is actually a branch of the Department of Defense, and has a gold mine of expertise on hand.</p>
<p>They could take a little break from illegal domestic spying, and actually carry out their intended function for a change.</p>

<blockquote><p>O brave new world,<br />
That has such people in ’t!</p></blockquote>
<p>Keeping the supply chain <em>in-house</em> so to speak, is one way of making sure that vulnerabilities that exist can&#8217;t be blamed on the PRC. Instead, courtesy of Edward Snowden, we know that the NSA et alii will quite happily corrupt the supply chain on their ownsome.</p>
<p>And then, there&#8217;s that famous quote from both Alan Shepard and John Glenn:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I guess the question I&#8217;m asked the most often is: &#8220;When you were sitting in that capsule listening to the count-down, how did you feel?&#8221; Well, the answer to that one is easy. I felt exactly how you would feel if you were getting ready to launch and knew you were sitting on top of two million parts &#8212; all built by the lowest bidder on a government contract.”</p></blockquote>
<p>With USD $600.00 toilet seats &#8211; lowest bidder &#8211; it&#8217;s caviar for the bosses&#8217; mistresses and tortoises all the way down for the rest. (I leave that for the inquisitive amongst the spooks to figure out: what level tortoise are they?)</p>

<p>Your <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/10/security_vulner_17.html#c6783484" rel="nofollow ugc">quote</a> from Alan Shepard and John Glenn is a keeper! Nothing quite like realists with a sardonic eye 🙂</p>
<p>The DoD-led <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.militarytimes.com/assets/eo-13806-report-final.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">report</a> on the Industrial Base and Supply Chain does have a series of recommendations: 19 in the Executive Summary, expanded into 24 under Section: “VII.A Blueprint for Action.”</p>
<p>Some of those are:</p>
<blockquote><p>• Creation of a National Advanced Manufacturing Strategy by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, focused on opportunities in advanced manufacturing<br /> <br />
• Department of Labor’s chairing of a Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion to identify strategies and proposals to promote apprenticeships, particularly in industries where they are insufficient<br /> <br />
• Diversify away from complete dependency on sources of supply in politically unstable countries who may cut off U.S. access; diversification strategies may include reengineering, expanded use of the National Defense Stockpile program, or qualification of new suppliers</p></blockquote>
<p>The White House&#8217;s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/documents-and-reports/" rel="nofollow ugc">Office of Science and Technology Policy</a> (@WHOTP) released NSTC’s “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Advanced-Manufacturing-Strategic-Plan-2018.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">Strategy for American Leadership in Advanced Manufacturing</a>” in October of 2018, I guess this month that is.</p>
<p>Goal 3 of the Strategy “Expand the Capabilities of the Domestic Manufacturing Supply Chain” does mention a sub-goal to “Strengthen the Defense Manufacturing Base.”</p>
<p>There was no mention of bathroom seats or dual-use capabilities; well I take that back, there is 🙂</p>

				<p>The focus seems to be on preventing unauthorised firing of weapon systems. Like most people, I would be glad to know that access to all these weapons &#8211; not just the nuclear ones &#8211; is as restricted as possible.</p>
<p>However, the people with the most to gain from hacking US weapons &#8211; and the people who can allocate the most resources to the job &#8211; are the United States&#8217; enemies. They&#8217;re not interested in firing the weapons: quite the opposite. Their interest is in hacking weapons to prevent them from firing, or delay them, or interfere with guidance/targeting systems.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the more safeguards there are to prevent unauthorised firing, the easier that becomes&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking at the report right now, but I can tell you this &#8211; a major corporate trend over the past few decades has been to cut costs by outsourcing, even overseas. Of course, cutting costs is one of those things, like the tooth fairy and flying saucers and the number Thirteen, that I leave to the superstitious.</p>
<p>And believing that President Donald Trump is going to overturn forty years of cost-cutting measures that his crony capitalists have benefited from, is rather like believing that one day everybody who enters the Lottery is going to win, simultaneously.</p>
<p>And $600.00 toilet seats were iirc, a feature of one of Our Dear Friend Lockheed&#8217;s innovations for one of their aircraft, a maritime patrol iirc. It probably was the lowest bid.</p>

				<p>@Wesley Parish</p>
<p>Keeping with the theme of memorable sayings, here is one from President Trump:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Economic security is national security”</p></blockquote>
<p>That was the touchstone phrase repeated by Peter Navarro is his New York Time’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/opinion/america-military-industrial-base.html" rel="nofollow ugc">article</a> &#8220;America’s Military-Industrial Base Is at Risk. And here’s what the White House is going to do about it.&#8221; Peter Navarro currently serves as Assistant to the President and Director of Trade and Industrial Policy.</p>
<p>To your observations:</p>
<blockquote><p>“a major corporate trend over the past few decades has been to cut costs by outsourcing, even overseas&#8230;</p>
<p>And believing that President Donald Trump is going to overturn forty years of cost-cutting measures that his crony capitalists have benefited from, is rather like believing that one day everybody who enters the Lottery is going to win, simultaneously.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That really had me thinking.</p>
<p>So, the DoD-led <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.militarytimes.com/assets/eo-13806-report-final.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">report</a> on the defense industrial base talks about five macro forces and ten risk archetypes that are contributing to insecurity in DoD’s supply chain. For the risk archetypes it mentions such factors as single source, fragile market, and foreign dependency.</p>
<p>For fragile market, they specifically cover the dominance of Asia’s production of printed circuit boards (producing 90% of the global market of PCBs), and under the risk archetype of foreign dependency, the fact that China is a single or sole supplier of critical energetic materials used in munitions and missiles &#8211; where the cost and time to develop new materials could run up to hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, under the macro forces topic of “Decline of U.S. manufacturing base capabilities and capacity” there was an eye-catching graph revealing China’s dominance of the rare earth elements market (Figure 14). These rare earth elements are needed for many major weapons systems, including lasers, sonar, night vision systems, and more.</p>
<p>Another graph illustrates China, as by far, the highest identified source of counterfeit electronics (Figure 15).</p>
<p>So, you have me wanting to find the balance sheets and risk assessments that underlay all these costs and calculations. Surely, there must be values associated with national security, risk tolerance, and long-term planning.</p>
<p>Do you think we will be able to gain financial transparency into these matters and who do you think will be best able to orchestrate it? I bet the receipt for the $600 toilet seat made the rounds, must have been very special 🙂</p>
<p>P.S. Both handles @SecReport and @Timothy belong to the same person, so as the Moderator prefers, I will consolidate them under @Timothy</p>

				<p>@ All,</p>
<p>With regards the $600 toilet seat, you might want to enquire what civil aircraft that you travel on have to pay even for second hand toilets from aircraft that have been scrapped&#8230;</p>
<p>You might find your eyebrows reaching past your hairline&#8230;</p>
<p>Somewhere in my collection of junk I have a small bolt in a nice sealed gas purged perspex box. I was given it from a &#8220;bankrupt stock&#8221; clear out because it failed to auction. It came in a bigger box with just under three hundred pages of test data, qualifing it for use on space craft. I won&#8217;t tell you the original USD price as I keep that a suprise for the occasional guest. But lt was rather more than that toilet seat&#8230;</p>
<p>As they say &#8220;Quality costs&#8221; especially when that translates into &#8220;reliability&#8221;, you kind of don&#8217;t get Auto-techs dropping by near Mars or beyond, not even NEO/LEO since they mothballed the Space Shuttle&#8230;</p>

<p>Thanks for that! It really got me chuckling &#8211; when people complained about some of those issues in the 80s and 90s, they were portrayed as pinkos, socialists (usually by people who had no idea what Socialism was, only that it was a convenient term of abuse), etc &#8211; particularly the &#8220;human capital&#8221; aspects. Or in other words, the fact that corporations found it convenient to fire people and hire cheap labour from overseas &#8211; cheap and without many rights, so they could be fired as fast as they were hired.</p>
<p>Slashdot had a link to an article late in 1999, iirc, where someone made the point that the &#8220;skills shortage&#8221; that was such a resident feature of the news of the day, when so many people were out of work and unlikely to ever find work again, when older people were being fired for no reason other than being older, etc, that this &#8220;skills shortage&#8221; was little more than a demand for subsidies and low-wage employees from overseas. (I wish my memory was better, so I could pinpoint the day and month, and dig out the original article. It&#8217;d still make interesting reading.)</p>
<p>Honestly I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s much hope for financial transparency in relation to the decisions made by the big corporations in outsourcing and the like. Not when it&#8217;s so easy to buy off politicians. Kill off <em>Citizens United</em> and you might begin to make some headway.</p>
<p>Frankly, the only risks that would&#8217;ve entered their assessments at the time of making those decisions, were percentage points of <em>Return On Investment</em>.</p>
<p>With regards to the Peoples Republic of China, they&#8217;ve played a very long and remarkably restrained game up till now. President Donald Trump has to a large degree played into their hands &#8211; just think of a five-year-old at a poker game, who insists on showing everybody his cards and who wants to swap everything Like NOW!!! 🙂 His stupidest action was pulling out of the Paris agreement &#8211; that gave the PRC incentive to pull ahead of the US in renewable energy research. Likewise the Europeans. Just think of the joy it will bring if the PRC slaps retaliatory tariffs on rare earth products, and councils its investors that in the absence of the promised Federal infrastructure investment in the US, US Federal Bonds are no longer a trustworthy investment.</p>

<p>So, yes, with regards to the workforce skills shortage, this does seem to be a highly material concern for the manufacturing sector. According to the defense industrial base <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2018/Oct/05/2002048904/-1/-1/1/ASSESSING-AND-STRENGTHENING-THE-MANUFACTURING-AND-DEFENSE-INDUSTRIAL-BASE-AND-SUPPLY-CHAIN-RESILIENCY.PDF" rel="nofollow ugc">report</a>, the U.S. manufacturing sector lost a total of 5m jobs from 1998 to 2018 and goes on “the skill atrophy accompanying such loss can have profound short and long term effects on industrial capabilities.”</p>
<p>As far as having economic and national security incentives to address these shortages &#8212; and not to continue with the strategy of short-term, low-cost overseas labor as you brought up &#8212; here are some <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2018/10/10/a-stronger-defense-industrial-base-starts-with-congress/" rel="nofollow ugc">thoughts</a> from retired USAF four-star general Herbert &#8220;Hawk&#8221; Carlisle who is currently the president of the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA):</p>
<blockquote><p>Our military’s superiority, based heavily on the dominance of our weapons systems, is not a birthright… The end of the Cold War and almost three decades of unchallenged military dominance have lulled us into complacency and underinvestment…</p>
<p>The report thankfully tackles the harder imperatives, too. For example, it recommends accelerating workforce development efforts to grow domestic STEM and crucial trade skills, such as the high-tech welders needed in our aerospace industry. This initiative is win-win, delivering high-quality jobs while creating a sustainable, resilient workforce that builds the best equipment to protect our nation.</p>
<p>The report also calls for more innovative uses of existing programs such as the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment Program, and the Defense Production Act Title III. The Pentagon’s leveraging of these authorities can rush investments to eliminate critical bottlenecks, support fragile suppliers and mitigate single points of failure to ensure industry’s ability to meet vital needs.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Defense Acquisition University was mentioned in the report as part of the workforce restructuring initiative. The above article was posted on their <a href="https://www.dau.mil/" rel="nofollow ugc">website</a>.</p>
<p>Wesley, you mentioned the possibility that the PRC could leverage &#8220;retaliatory tariffs on rare earth products.&#8221; My goodness, that could really put us in quite a pickle. I wonder how far down that option is in the card deck.</p>
<p>The Federal Register published a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/05/18/2018-10667/final-list-of-critical-minerals-2018" rel="nofollow ugc">notice</a> in May 2018 “Final List of Critical Minerals 2018” &#8212; of which there are 35. I believe this may be related to <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/26/2017-27899/a-federal-strategy-to-ensure-secure-and-reliable-supplies-of-critical-minerals" rel="nofollow ugc">EO 13817</a> “A Federal Strategy To Ensure Secure and Reliable Supplies of Critical Minerals.” So perhaps, we are getting wise, or the screws have been turning 🙂</p>
<p>Do you think the U.S. has painted itself into this corner because of it’s short-term, market-based approach? I wonder if there is a sector of the market that provides any kind of metric on these changing world circumstances or of the industrial base overhaul (as you mentioned, renewables or U.S. Federal bonds) because it really is quite an investment and change of strategy to make.</p>
<p>Aside from the Bloomberg Supermicro hiccup, this supply chain matter is something that is rather softly lit in the current main stream media so I am grateful for your well of knowledge and insights. Thank you for considering the ideas from the report and offering some terrific food for thought.</p>

				<p>Remember the Brown Bess rifle?  The one that won the Revolutionary War?   Rugged, simple to use, relatively cheap.  It worked.  That is mostly how you win a war: with people who know how to use simple, effective technology.</p>
<p>After 9-11 a cash bonanza took place.  Afghanistan is a stage set on which U.S. entities fight each other for money and influence.  Full stop.  The Afghans are props.</p>
<p>Not that many people really care, care in the sense of civic virtue, in doing what is best for America and not what is best for themselves.  The U.S. has lost in Iraq, and it is on its way to a defeat in Afghanistan too.  Both became vendor-driven, short-term-profit escapades. Both saw huge amounts of money and tons of weapons go into the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p>The U.S. has fetishized technology, and technology is not the solution to every problem.  Drone war, for example, may make a lot of folks rich and it may kill a lot of bad guys, but playing whack-a-mole does not work in a tribal society, and it has done nothing other than galvanize entire populations against the U.S. and deepen the hate. How?  Because of killing so many bystanders.</p>
<p>A General who is going to work for a contractor once he retires is perhaps not the person to listen to.  What the U.S. needs is soldiers who have a fighting ethos and leaders who are not focused on themselves.  The military needs focus and training.  It does not need hyper-expensive weapon systems that do not work.</p>
<p>In fact, the U.S. military is in deep trouble right now.  For example, this emphasis on diversity in combat arms is pure rat poison.  Focus has been lost.  Ships cannot navigate and run into other ships.  Soldiers cannot fight unless they have drones and air support.  It is a gigantic mistake to send untrained soldiers into combat, semi-trained and dependent on extremely complex technology.  If you doubt that the U.S. military is in deep kimchi, then go to YouTube and watch the harrowing Tongo Tongo video. I spent ten years in U.S. Special Forces.  Please allow me to share this:  <b>those guys had absolutely no idea what they were doing</b>.</p>
<p>How does it happen that an SF Team has no idea about tactics, no situational awareness, and runs away when the shooting starts?  It happens after a process of many years of apathy, of leaders who do not care, who get promoted and do not say anything when they know their guys are hanging in the wind and will get defeated if anything real happens.</p>
<p>It happens when training and quantifiable job proficiency are no longer linked to promotion. It happens when people no longer care, and once that occurs, it does not matter what kind of tech you enjoy on the battlefield. It is not a problem that can be solved by money.  It is a problem of malaise and a loss of fighting ethos that has been exacerbated by greed at the top.</p>

<p>It leaves me bemused that retired General Carlisle claims the Pentagon is underfunded. According to two of Tomgram&#8217;s commentators, William Hartung and William Astore, the Pentagon&#8217;s problems lie more with its lack of accountability.</p>
<p>Let me quote:</p>
<p>William Hartung, What a Waste, the U.S. Military<br />
<a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/176126/tomgram%3A_william_hartung%2C_what_a_waste%2C_the_u.s._military/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/176126/tomgram%3A_william_hartung%2C_what_a_waste%2C_the_u.s._military/</a></p>
<blockquote><p>One reason the Pentagon has been able to get away with all this is that it has proven strangely incapable of doing a simple audit of itself, despite a Congressionally mandated requirement dating back to 1990 that it do so. Conveniently enough, this means that the Department of Defense can’t tell us how much equipment it has purchased, or how often it has been overcharged, or even how many contractors it employs. This may be spectacularly bad bookkeeping, but it’s great for defense firms, which profit all the more in an environment of minimal accountability.

<blockquote><p>Something similar is true of our relationship to the U.S. military. An institutional report card with so many deficits and failures, a record of deportment that has led to death and mayhem, should not be ignored. The military must be called to account.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>How? By cutting its allowance. (That should make the brass sit up and take notice, perhaps even think.) By holding senior leaders accountable for mistakes. And by cutting the easy praise. Our military commanders know that they are not leading the finest fighting force since the dawn of history and it’s time our political leaders and the rest of us acknowledged that as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the problem is far worse than retired General Carlisle admits. It&#8217;s more likely to be a matter of <em>which</em> rather than <em>what</em> &#8211; <em>which items are essential?</em>, rather than <em>what more can we get?</em> And that requires serious thought about the purpose of the military, which in turn requires serious thought about the nation and society in general.</p>
<p>And in answer to your question about the PRC and some of their options, I&#8217;d say tariffs on rare earths and dumping the Federal Bonds etc, are a &#8220;<em>nuclear</em>&#8221; option for them, to be taken only as a last resort.</p>

<blockquote><p>It leaves me bemused that retired General Carlisle claims the Pentagon is underfunded.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gen. “Hawk” Carlisle (USAF, Ret.) and NDIA President did an <a href="https://govmatters.tv/pentagon-releases-defense-industrial-base-report/" rel="nofollow ugc">interview</a> and my impression was that the strategic value of resource allocation (spending) was to shore up points of potential vulnerability. He iterates that securing mid-level contractors in the supply chain is designed to ensure we are not relying on a less than friendly country to supply essential materials. You are of course right that defense-related funding is on the rise. More of your concerns on defense expenditures:</p>
<blockquote><p>One reason the Pentagon has been able to get away with all this is that it has proven strangely incapable of doing a simple audit of itself, despite a Congressionally mandated requirement dating back to 1990 that it do so… but a recent analysis by the Project on Government Oversight notes that the Pentagon has so far spent roughly $6 billion on “fixing” the audit problem &#8212; with no solution in sight.</p></blockquote>
<p>A Congressional <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/department-of-defense-audit-and-business-operations-reform-at-the-pentagon" rel="nofollow ugc">hearing</a> in March 2018 titled “Department of Defense Audit and Business Operations Reform at the Pentagon” does give some transparency into the DoD audit process. According to <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/NORQUIST.FINAL%202018-03-07%20SBC%20Norquist%20Statement_.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">written testimony</a> from the DoD Comptroller and CFO David Norquist:</p>
<blockquote><p>The financial statement audit requirement was initially established in 1990 when Congress passed the Chief Financial Officer Act, which, as amended, required the 24 largest federal agencies to complete independent annual financial statement audits. Until this year, DoD was the only large federal agency not under full financial statement audit. The size and complexity of the enterprise, combined with the pace of military operations, made meeting this requirement challenging.</p></blockquote>
<p>The testimony provides that DoD will start a full financial audit for FY 2018, anticipating that the the project will require 1,200 financial statement auditors with a projected audit cost of $367 million in FY 2018. As far as measuring progress, Mr. Norquist testifies that the DoD expects to “receive our first audit results in November 2018 and that will provide us with a baseline to track progress. We have an ongoing dialogue with GAO and as required by the NDAA, will be providing Congress with semi-annual feedback.” The testimony shares that the feedback the DoD receives from the audit feedback cycle will help reflect weaknesses in business operations and support better resource allocation decisions.</p>
<p>CSIS also published a <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/analysis-fy-2019-defense-budget" rel="nofollow ugc">report</a> titled “Analysis of the FY 2019 Defense Budget” in September 2018. Figure 4 shows that the defense budget ($1,035.0B for FY 2019 in Table 1) has declined as a percentage of the GDP over the last 50 years, albeit not because defense spending has declined, but because both the economy’s size and the overall federal budget have increased.</p>
<p>I appreciate you sharing the the commentator thoughts from Mr. Hartung and Mr. Astore on defense spending inefficiencies. The belief that priorities and resource allocations can be improved seem to drive a higher level of evolution. Do you believe that the results of the audit will help reveal misallocated resources and tailor spending more effectively on the essentials? And your response to my question:</p>
<blockquote><p>And in answer to your question about the PRC and some of their options, I&#8217;d say tariffs on rare earths and dumping the Federal Bonds etc, are a &#8220;nuclear&#8221; option for them, to be taken only as a last resort.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I would agree with you. The most recent weekly publication from <i>The Economist</i> provides helpful insight into the <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/10/18/americas-new-attitude-towards-china-is-changing-the-countries-relationship" rel="nofollow ugc">China-American rivalry</a>. It discloses that the lines of communication between America and China are ratcheting down, but that “a lower profile Military Maritime Consultative Arrangement, in which each side swaps complaints… continues to function. Were that to now be abandoned, alarm bells should really start ringing.”</p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;m pleased that the US DoD is finally getting into auditing gear! And about time too! I&#8217;ve always taken it as read that one consequence of the US Declaration of Independence</p>
<blockquote><p>He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.</p></blockquote>
<p>was that the military is answerable to the taxpayer; reading this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though not a corporation, <b>DoD owes accountability to the American people</b>. Taxpayers deserve a high level of confidence that DoD’s financial statements present a true and accurate picture of its financial condition and operations.</p></blockquote>
<p>restores some confidence. It should also be remarked that accountability in the superpower&#8217;s military institutions gives allies confidence.</p>
<p>In answer to this question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do you believe that the results of the audit will help reveal misallocated resources and tailor spending more effectively on the essentials? </p></blockquote>
<p>airing the current state of the DoD&#8217;s assets, liabilities and finances will have some effect. Norquist&#8217;s comment on the Army&#8217;s <em>39 Blackhawk helicopters</em> that somehow had fallen through the cracks, or the Air Force&#8217;s <em>478 buildings and structures at twelve installations</em> that had been discovered as a result of the initial audits, is encouraging. (I take it the 478 buildings were not lean-tos and gardening shacks for a tired airman and his girl to enjoy a quiet afternoon&#8217;s relaxation &#8230; 🙂</p>
<p>Spending more effectively on the essentials? That in large part depends on what you determine are the essentials. At some risk of sounding flippant, I&#8217;d suggest an audit of US policies over the past forty-odd years in relation to the decline in infrastructure and manufacturing, and social and economic issues. To put it bluntly, I doubt anyone in any given military worldwide could give their whole mind to the job of national defense if they were aware that their partner and children ran the risk of groundwater poisoning, for example.</p>

				<p>@Wesley Parish; re: DoD Audit</p>
<blockquote><p>It should also be remarked that accountability in the superpower&#8217;s military institutions gives allies confidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree! I was pleased to find and start reading the DoD audit testimony arising from your prompt.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d suggest an audit of US policies over the past forty-odd years in relation to the decline in infrastructure and manufacturing, and social and economic issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>A Cambridge public policy professor approaches that topic in her <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/10/16/a-history-of-americas-economic-dynamism" rel="nofollow ugc">review</a> of the book “Capitalism in America: A History.” She highlights two prevailing themes. One theme is America’s tolerance for creative destruction, the other is the vital role of state intervention. She observes that the book&#8217;s authors, Alan Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge, have faith in America’s technological and scientific innovation, the book further pointing out that “American billionaires are not buying bolt holes in Shanghai or Beijing.”</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll still keep looking for that audit though and/or starting a policy+context collection 🙂</p>
<p>Yes to your remarks on the DoD audit testimony. The discovery of buildings and helicopters missing from the records is encouraging; that the DoD presents these in its testimony to Congress is a pretty earnest and appreciated self-assessment. More from Mr. Norquist’s <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/NORQUIST.FINAL%202018-03-07%20SBC%20Norquist%20Statement_.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">testimony</a> about the audit:</p>
<blockquote><p>To put the scope of this task in perspective, the Army has over 15 billion transactions that the auditors will select from.  With property, for example, the listing should have all the buildings, equipment, and software that equal the total value of property line on the financial statement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thinking of putting a value on software, the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694913.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">GAO report</a> from the original thread topic provides an idea of the various types of software programs in weapons systems (representing them via a fictitious system for classification reasons, it says). And the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.militarytimes.com/assets/eo-13806-report-final.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">industrial base and supply chain report</a> provides more national security assessments on the Software Engineering Sector. Is there a framework for putting a tangible value on software packages and their life-cycle costs?</p>

				<p>@ Little Lamb,</p>
<p>All this talk about Gnu Hurd and seL4 makes me think about that other BSD based micro kernel, the one that is in use in nearly all PC processor chips, MINIX3. So I watched a youtube video from Andy Tanenbaum [1]. Watch it, you can learn from it, or at least you are gonna have a couple of laughs.</p>
<p>This is from the slide &#8220;A need to rethink operating systems&#8221;. To make computers reliable again, they need to be:<br />
* Small<br />
* Simple<br />
* Modular<br />
* Reliable<br />
* Secure<br />
* Self-healing</p>

<blockquote><p>Is there a framework for putting a tangible value on software packages and their life-cycle costs?</p></blockquote>
<p>There is the Total Cost Of Ownership<br />
<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalcostofownership.asp" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalcostofownership.asp</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Total cost of ownership (TCO) is the purchase price of an asset plus the costs of operation. When choosing among alternatives in a purchasing decision, buyers should look not just at an item&#8217;s short-term price, which is its purchase price, but also at its long-term price, which is its total cost of ownership. The item with the lower total cost of ownership is the better value in the long run.</p></blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;d need to work out the cost of developing said package, then the costs of deploying it, training staff to use and maintain it, then the maintaining of it. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a specific framework for software, but TCO&#8217;s quite well understood. Security just needs to be made an indispensable part of the design and maintenance part of it.</p>
<p>All of which would not be of much use if the specifications keep changing in a long-standing tradition amongst both military and business, of updating the specifications on what often appears to be whim.</p>

<blockquote><p>There is the Total Cost Of Ownership… You&#8217;d need to work out the cost of developing said package, then the costs of deploying it, training staff to use and maintain it, then the maintaining of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, that sounds like a practical and comprehensive applied-use-approach. You&#8217;re right that there are quite a few more dimensions to cost-estimating software than it being a simple line item or one-time cost.</p>
<p>CMU’s Software Engineering Institute has a post “<a href="https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2018/04/why-does-software-cost-so-much.html" rel="nofollow ugc">Why Does Software Cost So Much?</a>” that talks about (and I have only started reading it) how to better estimate and control the cost of software development and sustainment.</p>
<p>In a linked document the “<a href="https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=502651" rel="nofollow ugc">Department of Defense Software Factbook</a>,” Table 1 gives the unit costs for different software domains, for example, ‘Real Time Software’ has an hours / lines of code* value of 1,070, ‘Engineering Software’ 936, and ‘Automated Info System Software’ 578. The difference in unit cost, according to the document, illustrates that ‘Real Time Software’ for a smaller amount of code requires a larger amount of effort. That does seem logical.</p>
<p><i>*Lines of code are being measured as KESLOC: Thousands (K) of Equivalent Source Lines of Code (ESLOC)</i></p>
<p>I am still browsing for something closer to a total cost of ownership framework, but have bookmarked the site. Perhaps I will stumble across something that approaches the TCO level of practicality.</p>
<blockquote><p>The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.<br />
