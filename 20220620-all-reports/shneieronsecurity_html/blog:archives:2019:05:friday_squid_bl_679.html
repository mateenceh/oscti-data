				<p>Mona Lisa &#8216;brought to life&#8217; with deepfake AI:<br />
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48395521" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48395521</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The subject of Leonardo da Vinci&#8217;s famous Mona Lisa painting has been brought to life by AI researchers.</p>
<p>The video, achieved from a single photo, shows the model in the portrait moving her head, eyes and mouth.</p>
<p>The latest iteration of so-called deepfake technology came out of Samsung&#8217;s AI research laboratory in Moscow.</p>
<p>Some are concerned that the rise of convincing deepfake technology has huge potential for misuse.</p>
<p>Samsung&#8217;s algorithms were trained on a public database of 7,000 images of celebrities gathered from YouTube.&#8221;</p>

Thanks for that link albert, I&#8217;ll check it out.<br />

They also mentioned the command line MAC address change for Linux.<br />
&#8220;in my spare time&#8221; I will go to that &#8216;semi-public&#8217; wifi spot and try connecting, disconnecting changing the MAC address and then connecting again to see if that clears their identification of my computer.</p>

				<p>The United States Justice Department, in its blind pursuit of revenge, has in fact opened itself up to the flavor, nature, and act of treason against the United States. Let me explain; the Espionage Act under which Assange has been charged was passed as a response to treasonous acts during World War I. If the state is improperly applying law that prevents treason, must in fact be an act of treason.</p>
<p>This case also fails to overrule &#8220;Principal Law&#8221; of the U.S. Constitution, specifically with respect to the First Amendment, and I quote; &#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would argue that Assange did, under speech, as a Journalist, exercised his discretion in publishing the illegality presented by facts. When murder, truth, and the execution of power all based on illegal acts can be tolerated, we are all war criminals. It is an indictment of this society. The United States and its citizenry has fallen into a crypto-facist malaise. Leaving to government the ultimate power without question, is certain to entertain the state at some point in the court of jokes and all of us in the future.</p>
<p>It is amazing to me that the U.S. press has been absent whilst the DoJ and their own government has specifically taken aim at them. There is a cost to ignorance, there is a cost to wishful thinking, there is a cost for arrogance. There is a cost to assume that no ill shall be taken, or given.</p>
<p>The intelligentsia is so late to this party that personally I have decided that there is no reason to observe the U.S. holiday designated as &#8220;Memorial Day&#8221;. The holiday is meant to bring a reflective view of those that have served their country and paid THE price. Now the question is&#8211;to what end?</p>
<p>Sorry for the spectacle Benjamin Franklin, I guess we can read earlier editions of the Framers&#8217; Almanac whilst flying a kite at the Fire Department. Hope you had fun in France. Say hello to Jefferson for me, will you? Dedicated in fond remembrance of the fateful experiment in a democratic republic. Rest in peace my friend.</p>

<p>I consider Assange unworthy of hero status for several reasons. But, still, and as expected, now that he is in the wild again it certainly does seem like a TON of charges are piling up.</p>
<p>My thought is only the very most rich persons in the world could mount a viable self-funded defense of them. Basically, Assange is facing a legal opponent with literal unlimited time, money, personnel and other resources working towards fixing it so he never gets out of prison, ever. Ouch!</p>
<p>With that said, Ed Snowden, a true hero in my estimation, must be taking note of Assange&#8217;s treatment. I am quite sure there is an even larger stack of charges awaiting him if he should ever become available.</p>

				<p>Julian Assange may or may not be a cretin &#8211; I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know him, I have never met him.</p>
<p>But I think one thing he did, publishing Chelsea Manning&#8217;s evidence that the US government was lying, counts as heroic.  I cannot believe he didn&#8217;t know he was poking a very large bear, and that the consequences would come back upon him in a big way.</p>
<p>Other things?  I don&#8217;t know.  He may not be a hero.  But that was heroic.</p>
<p>Edward Snowden did a similarly heroic thing.  Again, other things, I don&#8217;t know, but he too poked a very large bear (and made better choices about where to run to).</p>
<p>One establishment that does not come off as a hero here is the U.S. government.</p>

				<p>@etep, @Weather, et al</p>
<p>The Eric S. Raymond linked site, and also catb.org, don’t seem to allow https.</p>
<p>Minor rant a propos E. Raymond: I never saw why “cathedral” is an appropriate metaphor. The cathedral was in its essence the most open, popular, historically stable institution, and a repository of perennial true order. Also why bazaar, as they are “hives of scum and villainy” living off proprietary profit gouging methods. The Justinian souk would be better, where the point was to concentrate all manufacturers of a given type in one place so that the hapless customer could at least have an option to compare.</p>

The fifth thing you notice at the American Psychiatric Association meeting is that the CIA has set up a booth.</p>
<p>I was pretty curious about what the CIA wanted from psychiatrists (did they lose the original MKULTRA data? do they need to gather more?), but I was too shy to ask their representative directly. I did take one of their flyers, but it turned out to just be about how woke they were:<br />
&#8230;<br />
I dunno, if I were working in an area where the research supporting a treatment has a tendency to collapse suddenly and spectacularly, I might want to avoid building an association in people’s minds between my medication and a house of cards. But the ways of Vraylar® are inscrutable to mortal men.<br />

				<p>China has recently blocked access to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>This is not a security issue from the Western viewpoint, per se, but it is still important.</p>
<p>The mood has darkened in this part of the world, especially in South Korea. Thailand has a pall thrown over it. China, after so many years of rapid development, now has question marks. This is all negative for security and prosperity in East Asia and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Just about anyone who has worked in IT in China will tell you it&#8217;s vibrant, a lot is going on. Westerners tend to be treated very well. The work ethic is demanding. The place is booming.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to see China closing off. The trade conflicts with the U.S., generated by the U.S., look like a lose-lose situation, and worsening relations could take a downward plunge&#8211;not something the world wants to see.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the state is improperly applying law that prevents treason, must in fact be an act of treason.&#8221;</p>
<p>Treason, treason, treason, eh?</p>
<p>Your argument seems to be:</p>
<p>&#8220;If a state is improperly applying a law about X, then the state is guilty of X.&#8221;</p>
<p>Call it the &#8220;I&#8217;m rubber, you&#8217;re glue&#8221; Principle.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s try it out:</p>
<p>If a state is improperly apply a law about drunk driving, is that in fact a case of drunk driving?</p>
<p>No, it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Although your principle has an attractive symmetry it really equates two very different things.</p>

Thank you for the link!<br />
I guess it should be FBI both as well addressing mass shootings,   serial killer/rapist/terrorist profiling utilizing psychiatric tools for prediction. Moreover, suicide level is high within ranks of LEAs (social isolation: cop is always cop, so his/her friends could only other cops due to general distrust, etc. mental problems of undercover agents &#8211; split personality, etc.)</p>
<p>CIA tasks (in that field) is to maintain psychiatric health of their staff, fields agents in particular, i.e. “Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster&#8230; for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.”</p>
<p>―  Friedrich W. Nietzsche</p>
<p>Same applied to shrinks as well forensic in particular.</p>
<p>They probably want finally to bring psychiatry closer as possible to science in the cases of evaluation/diagnostics, i.e. close mapping mental disorders with patterns in the brain structures utilizing AI. E.g. by analyzing fMRI of folks with English as first language and folks whose first language is other (except folks fro Singapore) but pretend to have English as first language, areas in the brain responding by English language stimulus are different. I guess same research could be done on original name and legend name of spy. See, 007 almost always used his own name James Bond :). You can&#8217;t find out original name of language, but it should red flag. I hope they are not using Dr. Cameron of 21 century &#8211; see quote above.</p>

<p>Just a pseudorandom refreshment about using tools to misdirect pattern recognition tools that are hyperfocused on (y)our text/typing.  This is pretty much not yet very effective; however, it takes practice to accomplish anything.  Everyone (everyone!) starts from zero.  It took a very long time just to make these.  Yet, if wasting a chosen select bit of my own time helps to discourage others from wasting my time and resources and yours, then it was worth it.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone else will be reminded of better techniques.</p>

				<p>Thanks for the first several comments this round.  I read most of the comments, thus far for this week&#8217;s entry.  Often I just speedread and skim.</p>
<p>Some rather important security things bubbling up to keep tabs upon:</p>
<p>0) START ARCHIVING EVERYTHING USEFUL  Amnesia is the Biggest Threat to Freedom</p>
<p>if you ever had to recover from a traumatic brain injury and/or a stroke, you might already comprehend this.  yet this is a possibility coming to a theatre, oops, town near you!</p>
<p>incapacitation is not imaginary&#8230; consider if somebody purges all your transhumanist or cybernetic kinds of covert/unspoken &#8220;cyber&#8221; tools or merely misdirects them or fills them with bogus data&#8230;</p>
<p>1) CONVERGING COLLIDING &#8220;deep learning&#8221; &amp; &#8220;neural net&#8221; type of stuff is already converging with DNA computing, wearable technology, surgically implanted wearable technology, the g-d-dmnd IoT, so-called &#8220;cloud computing&#8221;, CRISPR (the abomination) results, materials sciences (think non-metallic, non germanium, non silicon electronics and circuits; bendable or plastic or transparent LEDs/chips/cloth wires, etcetera), invasive surveillance, evasive radar techniques, DARPA website promos about implanted brain chips and neurological interfaces</p>
<p>2) US White House Continuing Infiltration, Continued Undermining of US Institutions &amp; Traditions by insiders, Displacement of US Diplomats, Attempts to Buy &amp; Steal the American People&#8217;s Preferences</p>
<p>3) Total lack of US Congressional/Legislative/Judicial Enforcement of Violators of US Laws (Civic, Municipal, County, State, Regional, Intra-State, Federal, Internation Treaty-Derived, + Implied Military Agreements/Pacts/Necessities/Customs/Zones).</p>
<p>4) Now the Trumpsters are picking on the CIA?????!!!!??!</p>
<p>5) International hate groups have been recently documented trying to expose the anti-hate group counter-terrorism groups and covert individuals.  I could joke about the Trump admin implicating themselves if you read between the lines of 4+5.</p>
<p>If no one is going to do anything about the vast incursions, they will only get worse until all hell breaks loose.</p>
<p>oops, gotta go.<br />
my laptop is getting rained upon and I&#8217;m outside for the moment.<br />
keep your heads up.  peace is a real choice worth re-upping.</p>

&#8220;If a state is improperly applying a law about X, then the state is guilty of X.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just stick to treason.  Treason is separate from espionage, because it requires a state of war to exist.  So, it has nothing to do with the rest of Name Withheld&#8217;s post.</p>
<p>That said, if officials of the state are incorrectly apply a law regarding treason, it could be considered conspiracy to commit the offense if the reason was to further more treason.</p>
<p>Certainly, the charges of espionage against Assange could hardly be construed as an attempt to encourage more espionage.  So, the logic fails on that ground.  The government is not guilty of espionage unless the prosecution of Assange it done in order to cause more espionage.</p>
<p>As far as Assange is concerned, I think the stuff he published is covered by the 1st amendment.  If he operated a secure drop where people could leave disclosures, that&#8217;s covered.   But, if he engaged in a conspiracy to steal the information, and the conspiracy had an overt act committed by one of the conspirators, he has a problem.  So, to the extent he corresponded to Manning and aided and abetted the theft of the documents that were leaked, he could very well have committed the offense of espionage.  It all depends on the level of support.  If his role was simply to tell Manning if you have some good stuff, I&#8217;ll publish it, then it is OK.  But the original charge alleges that he aided an abetted the cracking of a password.   I don&#8217;t believe the attempt has to be successful to deem Assange a conspirator.</p>
<p>His best chance is the U.K. deeming the U.S. prosecution a <i>political</i> trial, and declining the extradition request.</p>

				<p>Remember when AV scanning software would amp up the fear/panic over browser cookies by flashing red and saying &#8220;malicious files&#8221;?</p>
<p>Meet attorney Timothy Parlatore and reporter Carl Prine, who think that hosting your logo (literally the images that goes out with every E-mail you send &#8211; a prime candidate for eliminating from your outgoing bandwidth by referencing a commercial server) instead of attaching it in the message is &#8220;a Trojan horse they put on the system&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fear-mongering is abundant. What other malware was placed on their system? Is there a wiretap in their phone? Parlatore, who has only been aware of these &#8220;tracking devices&#8221; for a few months, already knows that a stalker learned their victim&#8217;s whereabouts when such a device &#8220;gathered up the location and other information from the victim&#8217;s phone&#8221;. A defense motion identifies this tracking device as &#8220;a &#8216;Splunk&#8217; tool&#8221; (splunk.com?) &#8220;which can allow the originator full access to his computer, and all the files on the computer&#8221;. Gabe Rottman (rcfp.org) claims that the tracking software in this E-mail could surreptiously track who else the reporter is talking to, including &#8220;other sources in totally unrelated cases to government scrutiny&#8221; and asserts that the Justice Department &#8220;would likely have to get a court order or use a subpoena even to get the metadata under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sri Sridharan (usf.edu), Florida Center for Cybersecurity, says it &#8220;seems to be breaking new ground that cries out for legislative action&#8221;, invoking Congress.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all for privacy, but this behavior is making cybersecurity look bad. We don&#8217;t need to spread misinformation to justify privacy laws. Doing so seems more like a set-up to make privacy <i>look bad</i>. Technically <i>every</i> website is a tracking device, because it learns your IP address with every action you take on it &#8211; <i>it must</i>, that&#8217;s how TCP/IP <i>works</i>.</p>
<p>If <i>the architecture of the internet</i> is, as Rottman wants it, a 4th Amendment violation, then why not just admit your end-game and declare the entire Internet unconstitutional?</p>

<p>The Robinson Broadcast Method modified using Blockchain ledger. Essentially, to realize broadcast of encrypted messages, it is posted onto a public blockchain ledger where anybody could have been the poster and anybody could have been the recipient assuming the key is not reused again. Due to portability of blockchain transaction output messages (txout) that are sent to miners to mine and then added to the ledger, you could technically encrypt in air/energy gap and walk the ciphertext to whoever you want to use as a broadcast client to broadcast to miners to mine and add to blockchain.</p>
<p>This is getting closer and it seems quite practical.</p>

				<p>@Navyier, @usual suspects</p>
<p>A couple of interesting articles on the US Navy and the US Air Force<br />
Why the Air Force is investigating a cyber attack from the Navy<br />
<a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-air-force/2019/05/21/why-the-air-force-is-investigating-a-cyber-attack-from-the-navy/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-air-force/2019/05/21/why-the-air-force-is-investigating-a-cyber-attack-from-the-navy/</a></p>
<blockquote><p>“In fact, I’ve learned that the Air Force is treating this malware as a cyber-intrusion on their network and have seized the Air Force Individual Military Counsel’s computer and phone for review,” he wrote.</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<p>Top Navy official calls out government lawyers for spying on legal team of Navy SEAL accused of war crimes<br />
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/navy-official-blast-government-lawyers-for-spying-on-navy-seal-lawyers-2019-5/?r=AU&#038;IR=T" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.businessinsider.com/navy-official-blast-government-lawyers-for-spying-on-navy-seal-lawyers-2019-5/?r=AU&#038;IR=T</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Wilson wrote in the letter that he was first notified on May 10 that the lead prosecutor in both cases had &#8220;inserted or caused to be inserted certain tracking software&#8221; into emails with the defense team, who opened the messages on both private, commercial, and military email networks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now who was it that declared that the United States would treat all cyber-intrusions as war, and would leave the option of a kinetic response open?</p>
<p>Happy happy joy joy! who needs a Civil War reenactment when you can fight a real Civil War between the USAF and the USN &#8230;.</p>

The opponents 2016 plan[1] was for Italian Intelligence to hack into the Italian servers, plant classified emails from Hillary’s servers inside these servers on American soil, and then alert the FBI.<br />
The FBI would then raid these locations, “discover” these e-mails, investigate, link these servers to their political opponent and force him to resign&#8230;<br />
Nuclear engineer and mathematician Occhionero’s twitter account has numerous tweets related to this subject, including Mueller awarding one of Italy’s top spies the FBI Medal of Honor.<br />
The Italian spy network had a close relationship with Joseph Mifsud who lives in Rome and London yet a recent American report mislabeled him as a Russian.</p>

				<p>@ Petre Peter,</p>
<blockquote><p>Thieves blow up atm in Romania</p></blockquote>
<p>The article is light on details.</p>
<p>They may well not be using &#8220;explosives&#8221; like dynamite or other mining/demolition or other commercial explosives because they contain the equivalent of batch numbers that remain in the resedue and are fully tracable.</p>
<p>In other parts of the world cheap untracable gas canisters have been used as a &#8220;poor man&#8217;s Fuel Air Explosive&#8221;.</p>
<p>There is also the issue of &#8220;ink capsules&#8221; and similar anti-tamper systems that render the money inside unusable and like comercial explosives very tracable.</p>
<p>So lots of security questions but no answers yet 😉</p>

<blockquote><p>The Robinson Broadcast Method modified using Blockchain ledger.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m having a read through the paper, they get quite a few non-technical things quite wrong suggesting their research is not what it could be. Therefor I&#8217;m treating the paper with rather more of a sharp eye than I would normally, and mulling it over.</p>
<p>To be honest I&#8217;m not sure the &#8220;blockchain&#8221; usage realy adds anything, but experience tells us it could very easily slow things down to the point they are bot workable beyond a very small scale.</p>
<p>But yes they do seem to have done a &#8220;Marconi&#8221; which is filtch lots of other peoples ideas, stick them in a box and say &#8220;this is all mine and I have the paper to prove it&#8221;.</p>
<p>As you know this is far from the first time when discussions from this blog have been &#8220;claimed&#8221; falsely as &#8220;original work&#8221; by others, some being semi-respectable academics trying to go into business. In most cases they give themselves away by not getting some of the technical details right or not understanding how to get things to work not just correctly but efficiently.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll comment more when I&#8217;ve had the chance to &#8220;sleep on it&#8221; a bit.</p>

<p>I mentioned, in one thread, the possibility of detection of a phone bug by noting the power level of a phone, then leaving it off, say, overnight. If the power level has sufficiently drained, I think that is a good indicator your phone is compromised. Any takers on seeing a problem w that?</p>
<p>(Remember when it was easy to just drop your battery out of your phone&#8230;)</p>
<p>Premise there is that someone who goes through the trouble to get on your phone in the first place very well may want to use the capability to run when your phone is off. Especially as turning your phone off might be the very method some use to ensure some privacy.</p>
<p>(Though having a small rf cage seems like it would be the safest assurance of temporary security.)</p>
<p>@Alyer Babtu</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any work being done on practical scalable schemes of “hiding in plain sight”, i.e. no encryption in the usual sense, or perhaps, better, encryption with special output format, where the text as transmitted has a reasonable “normal” meaning to the outsider, but a hidden meaning for the intended recipient ?&#8221;</p>
<p>I created a steganography app designed to do that with image files, using a browser plugin. Encryption usually is also used for such systems. Just about any form of data used online [or off] can be used in a steganographical format. Just about any form of signal. Today, with AR (Augmented Reality), you can leave messages which can be secret in plain sight.</p>
<p>There are also a wide variety of code talking methods, and if you are engaged with a group where they are distant, and change their usernames or other manner of disguise&#8230; previously known, private information, only the two of you would know can be used to authenticate personas.</p>
<p>Contents of a photograph, or other online graphical representation, can be used to transmit a message, if the concern is natural language processing systems. Though, this sort of method is starting to be out done by systems that can read text in photos.</p>
<p>This though sort of system its&#8217; self can be outdone, by pre-known private secrets, or by indirect communication. Such as someone temporarily changing their picture to wearing a certain tshirt, which tshirt might impart some communication to the viewer only they would be able to catch.</p>
<p>That is &#8216;a picture says a thousand words&#8217;, is a true saying.</p>
<p>Thinking on the above, you don&#8217;t even need AR for some nifty message passing in a busy city, or wherever, but simply tinted glasses of various kinds. Such as the &#8216;following powder&#8217; the KGB used to use on someone, so their target would stand out in a crowd.</p>
<p>When high tech is very much in usage, sometimes low tech can really meet the bill.</p>
<p>😛 🙂</p>

				<p>Stolen NSA tool is used in the Baltimore ransomware attack</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/stolen-nsa-hacking-tool-now-victimizing-us-cities-report-says/?utm_source=reddit.com#ftag=CAD0610abe0f" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.cnet.com/news/stolen-nsa-hacking-tool-now-victimizing-us-cities-report-says/?utm_source=reddit.com#ftag=CAD0610abe0f</a></p>
<p>What a nightmare. Russia has a history of using ransomware attacks on Ukraine, and Baltimore is NSA&#8217;s own backyard. Looks like they are probably doing this to psych out and expend unnecessary resources. Which is what chess players do.</p>
<p>It is odd that Russia relies so much on psychological games. But, they do.</p>
<p>Baltimore has been frontpage news for a few days now, because of this attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since 2017, when the N.S.A. lost control of the tool [via China or Shadow Brokers?], EternalBlue, it has been picked up by state hackers in North Korea, Russia and, more recently, China, to cut a path of destruction around the world, leaving billions of dollars in damage. But over the past year, the cyberweapon has boomeranged back and is now showing up in the N.S.A.’s own backyard.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Thomas Rid, a cybersecurity expert at Johns Hopkins University, called the Shadow Brokers episode “the most destructive and costly N.S.A. breach in history,” more damaging than the better-known leak in 2013 from Edward Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The Baltimore attack, on May 7, was a classic ransomware assault. City workers’ screens suddenly locked, and a message in flawed English demanded about $100,000 in Bitcoin to free their files: “We’ve watching you for days,” said the message, obtained by The Baltimore Sun. “We won’t talk more, all we know is MONEY! Hurry up!”</p>
<p>Today, Baltimore remains handicapped as city officials refuse to pay, though workarounds have restored some services. Without EternalBlue, the damage would not have been so vast, experts said. The tool exploits a vulnerability in unpatched software that allows hackers to spread their malware faster and farther than they otherwise could.&#8221;</p>

				<p>@Alyer Babtu, Thoth, The Pull,</p>
<blockquote><p>Is there any work being done on practical scalable schemes of “hiding in plain sight”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes there are various anonymity schemes for people to send and receive messages from locations that are not disclosed.</p>
<p>Essentially they are &#8220;networks ontop of networks&#8221; a very low grade example is Tor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve described other methods which appear to have ended up in the paper @Thoth linked to.</p>
<p>With regards,</p>
<blockquote><p>i.e. no encryption in the usual sense, or perhaps, better, encryption with special output format, where the text as transmitted has a reasonable “normal” meaning to the outsider, but a hidden meaning for the intended recipient ?</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve described such a scheme before built around &#8220;One Time Codes&#8221;. They can also be made to work over and over as long as you use a secure enough cipher in an appropriate mode.</p>
<p>The basic principle is as follows, you have certain fairly innocent and normaly used sentances, such as,</p>
<ul>We should meet up for a drink, how about next tuesday?</ul>
<p>You can use a number of different intros to replace &#8220;We should meet up&#8221; such as &#8220;How about we meet up&#8221; or &#8220;It&#8217;s been a while since we met up&#8221;. In effect you can use this either as an indicator or as a variable null to stop the sentence becoming &#8220;stylised&#8221; thus stand out with repeated use, or you could use it to do both.</p>
<p>You then produce a list of commestables to exchange with &#8220;drink&#8221; a list that has sixteen entries alows four bits to be communicated.</p>
<p>You can also use the &#8220;next tuseday&#8221; date etc in various ways, either to send a genuine time or a time offset or just to send another series of bits.</p>
<p>Several such sentances can be created with their own &#8220;dictionary-number&#8221; to send small amounts of data.</p>
<p>That sentance alone can send around 10bits which gives a thousand or more meanings that can be used to address a &#8220;code book&#8221; of words or sentances.</p>
<p>So far so good provided you only use the sentence once, it&#8217;s as provably secure as a One Time Pad is, for exactly the same reasons.</p>
<p>Codes as opposed to ciphers are broken by looking for repeats that correlate to some event/action because they have a fixed relationship.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s fairly easy to make the repeated use of the code as secure as a One Time Code. You simply &#8220;super-encrypt&#8221; the code number with a One Time Pad before converting it to a word in the code dictionary.</p>
<p>Whilst &#8220;One Time Pads/codes&#8221; have significant logistical problems not just in generation (KeyGen) but distribution you can significantly reduce the problem by using a Crypto-Secure stream generator or even block cipher with say &#8220;counter mode whitening&#8221;.</p>
<p>You do still have the problem of generating and maintaining the code books but this is a much lesser problem.</p>
<p>The other problem is,</p>
<ul>Three can keep a secret if two are dead.</ul>
<p>When you make codebooks you have to regard them as being only for communications between two entities. Because when a third party becomes aware codes are being used, they can betray them. Even though an adversary does not know the meaning as they don&#8217;t have the super-encipherment, they do know the difference between messages carrying code and those that do not, thus traffic analysis comes into play.</p>
<p>I hope that answers your question.</p>

				<p>@ The Pull,</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that is a good indicator your phone is compromised. Any takers on seeing a problem w that?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, how do you know the state of the battery?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely you can get a voltmeter into the phone as quite a few now are so slim they are actually glued together. So you are left with the battery indicator on a phone with malware on it&#8230; Thus a half bright malware writer will get the screen display to lie to you&#8230;</p>
<p>Which means you would have to do an extended test against time till the phone went from fully charged to turning it&#8217;s self off due to a genuine discharged battery detection (it&#8217;s unwise to over discharge modern LiPo etc bateries because the rapidly become damaged beyond recovery).</p>
<p>There is however another way to catch the phone &#8220;in use&#8221; which is a &#8220;Broadband Diode envelope detector&#8221; it acts like an old &#8220;crystal set&#8221; or &#8220;bug hunter&#8221; in that it rectifies the RF signal and it can then be amplified by an audio amplifier to either listen to or to be sent to a computer that you can write fairly simple software to analyze the actual signal type.</p>
<p>Without going into to many or in depth details, a modern state level agent would use software that &#8220;compressed, stored and forwarded&#8221; so a little like the old spy LPI &#8220;burst radios&#8221;. Only today as only voice is being looked for fairly good filtering and breath/pause elimination and similar can be used before using a low bit rate compander algorithm (have a look at how low bitrate the OpenSource &#8220;OGG&#8221; compander will go). The data can also be further compressed before the phone does an E.T. to &#8220;phone home&#8221; to the mother ship or more likely send data packets to the Internet.</p>
<p>Unfortunatly GSM phones have to &#8220;re-register&#8221; with the network every so often if they are not communicating for other reasons&#8230;</p>
<p>Thus a State Level agent worth their salt would analyse the &#8220;re-register&#8221; pattern and try and simulate it&#8217;s cadence by sending packets via the Internet in the same or marginaly faster cafence to stop the phone &#8220;re-registering&#8221; whilst also sending the data.</p>
<p>That way an inexperienced listener might think they are only hearing the phone re-registering. However if the detector is connected to a  computer with appropriate software it can easily tell the difference in a low bandwidth re-register and a high-bandwidth data transfer even though the transmission time is about the same.</p>
<p>There is however another trick you can do with your computer. Turn it into an audio jammer.</p>
<p>A friend does this they simply play music at a highish level into &#8220;studio speakers&#8221; with the cloth front removed. The mid range speaker is resessed in a &#8220;audio waveguide&#8221; and he simply puts the phone in there with the low frequency from the Woofer traveling through the case suround, and the high frequency from the Tweeter reflected back by the light screen on an adjustable angle poise lamp.</p>
<p>If you go back to the end of the glory days of Digital Rights Managment (DRM) watermarking, what killed it was a piece of software from Cambridge Universities Computer lab. What it did was marginally distort an image in two directions as well as chroma/brilliance. The result was that a human would not notice but the DRM detector would &#8220;fritz out&#8221;.</p>
<p>You can apply a similar technique to music files where you can stretch them in time but not pitch, andjust the phase relasionship to radically alter the audio envelope and apply the equivallent of a &#8220;parametric equalizer&#8221; to make other distortions to spectral content and amplitude. Most of which humans will ignore as they happily sing along in their heads. However what goes across the phone can not be synced up to any known audio recording so can not be &#8220;automagically&#8221; nulled out to get the quiet conversation on the other side of the room, especially if the phone mic is driven into nonlinear compression modes.</p>
<p>I hope that adds to your &#8220;OpSec&#8221; file 😉</p>

<p>&#8220;To be honest I&#8217;m not sure the &#8220;blockchain&#8221; usage realy adds anything, but experience tells us it could very easily slow things down to the point they are bot workable beyond a very small scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed blockchains get very messy when they grow big. Especially when it is used in a messaging context where somebody and anybody could send large amounts of data, it gets even worse but it is indeed a very attractive idea for the fact that very few software for secure chats and very few people these days bother to or even know how to get a broadcast up and working as per the original idea we had discussed.</p>
<p>As a compromised a blockchain is almost like a broadcast which can become messy as it grows.</p>
<p>We can solve two problems typically faced by blockchains via two methods which are already in use on certain blockchains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pruning of old records.</li>
<li>Incentivize without using a cryptocurrency</li>
</ul>
<p>Pruning of old records is quite straightforward, you can configure the clients/miners to prune away any records older than 30 days and Ehtereum blockchain and even Bitcoin blockchain have them but only Ethereum got the pruning feature into actual software while Bitcoin official software does not follow the paper to allow pruning.</p>
<p>The idea of pruning of encrypted blockchain messages is not only suitable for saving space on the blockchain but also to implicitly enforce a duration on all messages and their lifespan. It may or may not be a desirable feature to enforce pruning of blockchain stored messages on the entire blockchain but in general it is more helpful to prune old messages. Very few people would typically want to scroll back 1 month worth of messages anyway and if you really want a historical record of all the messages since account creation, then the messages should be cached on local storage instead of hoarding up space and become redundant on a blockchain in the first place. Messages can be created with some sort of metadata pointing to its once existence on a blockchain and thus even if the encrypted and signed messages are pruned, they will still contain metadata and signatures pertaining to its historical records of the message that has been mined by miners anyway and thus proving it once existed on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Using cryptocurrency to incentivize has always been a double edge sword. It creates a financial race of who can control the most cryptocurrency and manipulate the blockchain.  In order to remove the problems associated with most cryptocurrency, it is better to remove the financial portion of the blockchain which is the cryptocurrency and simply use the merkle tree structure of a blockchain as is.</p>
<p>Some schemes using blockchain do not have any financial incentive. In order to maintain a blockchain, all blockchain users automatically become miners and the ability to post messages onto blockchain depends not on the cryptocurrency and incentive but on cooperation on the blockchain. In order to post a message on a non-incentivized blockchain, the poster must &#8220;mine&#8221; X amount of messages (i.e. 5 messages) and add hashes and signatures of their mining of X amount of &#8220;mined&#8221; messages onto the message they want to post as a proof of mining and the next poster would also attempt to mine X amount of messages and then add their mining results to their own post and tag it onto the blockchain. If a message is discovered to have incorrect mining messages, it is disregarded and orphaned. Only messages in the proper chain would be considered correct and legitimate. This would ensure a fair game where every poster must mine a minimum threshold of messages before proceeding. Orphaned/disregarded messages are not broadcast onto the blockchain network and deleted from the local client&#8217;s blockchain cache storage.</p>
<p>The cache would be pruned and synced every 1 month or whatever time period agreed upon on the chain itself.</p>
<p>The only problem with this chain is whenever a new user installs the client and wants to send a message, they must sync their chain cache sufficiently and if there is lots of data to sync for the month, they would be in a fix.</p>
<p>This brings in an alternate method called a &#8220;light client&#8221; where only metadata headers of messages are synced and stored which makes it lighter and easier for new users but this also post a problem for embedded devices though and another solution is to rely on an active thick client and enter into a complete trusted state with the relying thick client (i.e. a server running a full fledge client software).</p>
<p>I am also aware that somehow the ideas of their design may not come from them and it seems to be rather suspiciously close to our discussion and thus the reason I decided to bring this up here.</p>

				<p>Regarding the secrecy of one vs. three (and hiding in plain sight); I had been thinking about this recently and meaning to post an idea here for some review/feedback.</p>
<p>Consider a journaling application that: backs up to “the cloud”, allows storing text and images, supports scanning QR codes to retrieve raw encoded data (you can get 2-3kb per code depending on image fidelity), and is capable of performing a standard set of cipher functions.</p>
<p>Now, using this app I could encrypt messages for myself and store them remotely for access from multiple devices. But, I would still be vulnerable to a “what’s app” attack. Peril!</p>
<p>However, I could install a copy of the app on an old phone or a burner phone and create a novel situation (bearing some degree of hardware chops I could also physically disable the radio on my burner). This burner phone could create a key and generate QR codes that contain cipher text of my private data. A second phone (even a phone with what’s app installed) could take photos of (or scan and store raw bytes of) such QR data and it would remain relatively private.</p>
<p>This would be perfect if I needed a way to keep notes that no one else could read in a shared location that I could access from multiple devices. But, if I were a schemer, it would also enable me to communicate with one or more entities who shared access to the account.</p>
<p>Basically air-gap transfer capability wrapped in a consumer grade note taking app. I just can’t figure out a way to add plausible deniability with the existence of the QR codes or cipher text. It’s kind of like Wa’el said some time ago that you can’t have both — and thus obscurity has a place, in practice, with this problem.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last year, Dutch authorities released the names of several people it said were involved in spying. A search for those names in a Russian car registration database &#8211; which is supposed to be secret and controlled by the interior ministry, but has been leaked to murky private operators &#8211; revealed those individuals&#8217; addresses.</p>
<p>They were traced to a building in Moscow used by the GRU &#8211; Russian military intelligence.&#8221;</p>

				<p>A blockchain is a public ledger which stores everything, while ephemeral communication is a privacy feature. To a global surveillance apparatus, they are essentially the same thing, because by default it stores all ephemeral communications. The only difference is the blockchain conveniently stores all messages in contextual structured manner (via cryptologic keys) without exhausting hardware on the surveilance side, IMHO.<br />
What the global surveillance seeks to identify is not only plaintext messages but also matching up sender and recipients. A blockchain may exhibit &#8220;broadcast&#8221; qualities but each sender/recipients are exposed at the time the intended recipient reads a message. This is in many ways inferior to using a public message board. An open facing message board allows broadcasting of messages, un-timely retrievals, and no ways to identify an intended recipient unless responded to.</p>

				<p>@AL, @Faustus</p>
<p>Thanks for adding to the scope and tenor&#8230;</p>
<p>It may not have been clear in my last post, the statement regarding treason was necessarily argumentative. A way to provoke conversation amongst others that could cause discovery/clarity. I&#8217;ve described similar means of discourse with Clive and this is a sort of discourse side-channel hack. Often deemed to be unfair, it is sometimes seen as provocative and an aloof form of prose, that is not my intent.</p>
<p>Creating greater discourse and exchanging thoughts on subjects is a multi-person affair. One does not need to victimize others in taking a position or setting out a point of view. Speaking to the issues/problems/ideas without resorting to juvenile means of dissuading others is important. This is a general observation, not a response to the discussion here. It rarely is difficult to be topical here, although there was this one time&#8230;skeptical?</p>
<p>If provocation can illuminate, done using neutral and non-threatening rhetoric and without personal attacks, we can realize more than just what comes from gazing at one&#8217;s navel. An author can exercise a sort of antithetical or &#8220;devil&#8217;s advocate&#8221; position within their own writing. I use it as a tool of rhetorical construction to bring a challenge to a particular hypothesis in flushing more detail out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Consumer Tech Perspective<br />
It’s the middle of the night. Do you know who your iPhone is talking to?<br />
[&#8230;]<br />
And your iPhone doesn’t only feed data trackers while you sleep. In a single week, I encountered over 5,400 trackers, mostly in apps, not including the incessant Yelp traffic. According to privacy firm Disconnect, which helped test my iPhone, those unwanted trackers would have spewed out 1.5 gigabytes of data over the span of a month. That’s half of an entire basic wireless service plan from AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>“This is your data. Why should it even leave your phone? Why should it be collected by someone when you don’t know what they’re going to do with it?” says Patrick Jackson, a former National Security Agency researcher who is chief technology officer for Disconnect. He hooked my iPhone into special software so we could examine the traffic. “I know the value of data, and I don’t want mine in any hands where it doesn’t need to be,” he told me.</p>
<p>In a world of data brokers, Jackson is the data breaker. He developed an app called Privacy Pro [ <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/disconnect-privacy-pro-entire/id1057771839?ls=1&#038;mt=8" rel="nofollow ugc">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/disconnect-privacy-pro-entire/id1057771839?ls=1&#038;mt=8</a> ] that identifies and blocks many trackers. If you’re a little bit techie, I recommend trying the free iOS version to glimpse the secret life of your iPhone.</p>
<p>Yes, trackers are a problem on phones running Google’s Android, too. Google won’t even let Disconnect’s tracker-protection software into its Play Store. (Google’s rules prohibit apps that might interfere with another app displaying ads.) &#8230;&#8221;</p>

&#8220;Bottle of Lies: How Poor FDA Oversight &amp; Fraud in Generic Drug Industry Threaten Patients’ Health&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; AMY GOODMAN: Could the government produce these drugs?</p>
<p>KATHERINE EBAN: Absolutely. And Elizabeth Warren, in fact, has a very interesting proposal to get the U.S. government to manufacture essential generic drugs. I mean, looked at one way, this is a national security issue. We need to manufacture our own medicine. What if we pissed off India, and they said, “Sorry, no more antibiotics”? We’d really be in a fix.</p>
<p>AMY GOODMAN: Some of the people you spoke to said they avoid taking prescription drugs.</p>
<p>KATHERINE EBAN: Well, they were more specific than that. And, in fact, this was a number of FDA investigators, who, based on the things that they witnessed in these plants overseas, basically have stopped taking generics manufactured overseas.</p>
<p>AMY GOODMAN: Where do they get them then?</p>
<p>KATHERINE EBAN: They try not to get sick. They are very particular about which companies they take drugs from. And it’s based on their own knowledge.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>AMY GOODMAN: So, you’ve been working on this book for years, and you’ve been doing this kind of research way beyond the research you did for this book. What shocked you most, Katherine?</p>
<p>KATHERINE EBAN: Some of the falsifications and fabrications that are going on in these plants. For example, they’re even fabricating their own data proving that the plants are sterile. They’re falsifying their microbiology data. They have to test the environment. They have to test the air. They have to test the water. They’re fabricating that data. So, what is real, and what is fake?</p>
<p>AMY GOODMAN: Is there a particular story that sticks in your mind that you cannot shake?</p>
<p>KATHERINE EBAN: I mean, I would have to say Peter Baker’s investigations into the plant, Wockhardt, which I chronicle in my book.</p>
<p>AMY GOODMAN: Peter Baker, the FDA inspector.</p>
<p>KATHERINE EBAN: Yes, absolutely. I mean, from the moment that he lands at an airport, is followed by company representatives, one of whom—there is a man who yanks open the door of his cab, takes a hard look at him, closes it again. The investigators go to the plant. Several of them fall ill because of tainted water.

<p>For me data traffic bandwidth = (Network charges + battery consumption), which is a good reason to have data switched off until I want to use it; and background data always off. Then there should be only the one app running at the time I turn data on. I know some others try to phone home, but they don&#8217;t get much of a look in.

				<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/29/18644237/robert-mueller-remarks-transcript" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.vox.com/2019/5/29/18644237/robert-mueller-remarks-transcript</a> [TL;DR video about 10 minutes]</p>
<p>&#8220;Here’s a full transcript of Robert Mueller’s remarks<br />
The former special counsel held a surprise news conference on Wednesday.  [ at the Department of Justice (DOJ) ]</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>[ Mueller speaking: ] Thank you for being here. Two years ago, the Acting Attorney General asked me to serve as Special Counsel, and he created the Special Counsel’s Office. The appointment order directed the office to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. This included investigating any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Now I have not spoken publicly during our investigation. I’m speaking out today because our investigation is complete. The Attorney General has made the report on our investigation largely public. We are formally closing the Special Counsel’s office, and as well I’m resigning from the Department of Justice to return to private life. I’ll make a few remarks about the results of our work. But beyond these few remarks it is important that the office’s written work speak for itself.</p>
<p>Let me begin where the appointment order begins: and that is interference with the 2016 presidential election. As alleged by the grand jury in an indictment, Russian intelligence officers who were part of the Russian military launched a concerted attack on our political system. The indictment alleges that they used sophisticated cyber techniques to hack into computers and networks used by the Clinton campaign. They stole private information and then released that information through fake online identities and through the organization Wikileaks. The releases were designed and times to interfere with our election and to damage a presidential candidate.</p>
<p>And at the same time as the grand jury alleged in a separate indictment, a private Russian entity engaged in a social media operation where Russian citizens posed as Americans in order to influence an election. These indictments contain allegations, and we are not commenting on the guilt or innocence of any specific defendant. Every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.</p>
<p>The indictments allege, and the other activities in our report describe, efforts to interfere in our political system. They needed to be investigated and understand. And that is among the reasons why the Department of Justice established our office. That is also a reason we investigated efforts to obstruct the investigation. The matters we investigated were of paramount importance and it was critical for us to obtain full and accurate information from every person we questioned. When a subject of an investigation obstructs that investigation or lies to investigators, it strikes at the core of the government’s effort to find the truth and hold wrong doers accountable.</p>
<p>Let me say a word about the report. The report has two parts, addressing the two main issues we were asked to investigate. The first volume details numerous efforts emanating from Russia to influence the election. This volume includes a discussion of the Trump campaign’s response to this activity, as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.</p>
<p>And in a second volume, the report describes the results and analysis of our obstruction of justice investigation involving the president.</p>
<p>The order appointing the Special Counsel authorized us to investigate actions that could obstruct the investigation. And we conducted that investigation and we kept the Office of the Acting Attorney General apprised of the progress of our work.</p>
<p>And as set forth in the report after that investigation, if we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.</p>
<p>We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime. The introduction to the volume two of our report explains that decision. It explains that under long-standing Department policy, a President cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view, that too is prohibited. The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that Department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider.</p>
<p>The Department’s written opinion explaining the policy makes several important points that further informed our handling of the obstruction investigation. Those points are summarized in our report, and I will describe two of them for you. First, the opinion explicitly permits the investigation of a sitting President because it is important to preserve evidence while memories are fresh and documents available. Among other things, that evidence could be used if there were co-conspirators who could be charged now. And second, the opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting President of wrong doing. And beyond Department policy we were guided by principles of fairness. It would be unfair to potentially — it would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge.</p>
<p>So that was Justice Department policy. Those were the principles under which we operated and from them we concluded that we would not reach a determination, one way or the other, about whether the President committed a crime. That is the office’s — that is the office’s final position, and we will not comment on any other conclusions or hypotheticals about the President.</p>
<p>We conducted an independent criminal investigation and reported the results to the Attorney General, as required by Department regulations. The attorney general then concluded that it was appropriate to provide our report to Congress and to the American people. At one point in time I requested that certain portions of the report be released. The Attorney General preferred to make that — preferred to make the entire report public all at once, and we appreciate that the Attorney General made the report largely public. And I certainly do not question the Attorney General’s good faith in that decision.</p>
<p>Now I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak to you in this manner. I am making that decision myself. No one has told me whether I can or should testify or speak further about this matter. There has been discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself. And the report is my testimony. I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before congress.</p>
<p>In addition, access to our underlying work product is being decided in a process that does not involve our office. So beyond what I have said here today, and what is contained in our written work, I do not believe it is appropriate for me to speak further about the investigation or to comment on the actions of the Justice Department or Congress. And it’s for that reason I will not be taking questions today as well.</p>
<p>Now before I step away, I want to thank the attorneys, the FBI agents, and analysts, the professional staff who helped us conduct this investigation in a fair and independent manner. These individuals who spent nearly two years with the Special Counsel’s Office were of the highest integrity.</p>
<p>And I will close by reiterating the central allegation of our indictments — that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interference in our election. That allegation deserves the attention of every American.</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you for being here today.&#8221;</p>

<p>This strongly suggests that (as I [emptywheel] predicted) the timing of Mueller&#8217;s statement/resignation today is tied to getting Miller&#8217;s testimony, which they&#8217;ve been trying to get for over a year. twitter.com/kpolantz/statu…</p>
<p>Miller is Roger Stone flunkie who was scheduling his time/shadowing him, including during the RNC, in 2016. He has also suggested he might face some exposure on financial issues. Stone was investigated for wire fraud,</p>
<p>Prosecutors have implied they may bring new charges against Stone once they get Miller&#8217;s testimony. We should also assume Mueller also got Mystery Appellant to comply. &#8230;&#8221;</p>

				<p>When the people with the guns call for using guns and say they have no concern for due process, this suggests that a democratic republic, as constituted by the framers of the U.S. Constitution, is no longer operable. I sat through a round table discussion with a half dozen security experts. Near the end of their conversation they contemplated the nature and guilt of one person, Assange, in a national security context. What I witnessed was sad. I doubt anyone on the panel, save on, could pass a immigration/naturalization citizenship test. Two months ago I took it, curious as to my &#8220;citizenship-worthy&#8221; standing, 100% pass.  But the test is not a &#8220;citizenship&#8221; test as much as it is a history test. What is missing is the reasoning, the debates, the reflection and the character of individuals that dared to throw off monarchy.</p>
<p>Those events starting from the mid-eighteenth century were part of the enlightenment in western civilization. A truly revolutionary period in human history. Understanding history and our place in it is important, I can only speculate as to the period that covers the late twentieth and early twenty first century. To my mind, we look pretty pathetic.</p>
<p>To all you &#8220;might makes right&#8217;ers&#8221; out there, get off your treadmill, out of your group think, and read the writings of Thomas Paine&#8211;all of them. You might learn something, and if you get past Paine, go directly to James Madison. I doubt many will make it past Paine, his poetry can be complex&#8230;but I love it. Wish I could have a conversation with someone such as Paine; but alas, in this life all I go through is Pain.</p>

				<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/30/politics/mueller-enigma/index.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/30/politics/mueller-enigma/index.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;After the president [Trump] hired a new legal team in 2018, they met with Mueller and his team to introduce themselves. The Trump team thought one of the advantages of hiring Jane and Marty Raskin was their past as colleagues with Mueller and Quarles. Jane Raskin worked with Mueller at the Justice Department, and she later worked with Quarles in private practice.</p>
<p>Last November, Trump&#8217;s legal team prepared to provide written answers to a list of questions the Mueller team had provided months earlier on his actions prior to the inauguration. It was a deal that resolved months of battling over prosecutors&#8217; request for a sit-down interview of the President.</p>
<p>The Trump team learned that Mueller&#8217;s prosecutors had mentioned the President by name in draft court paperwork related to a proposed plea deal they were pushing Jerome Corsi to sign. Corsi had no formal role on the Trump campaign but was an acquaintance of Roger Stone, a political adviser to then-candidate Trump.</p>
<p>The document, known as a &#8220;Statement of the Offense,&#8221; didn&#8217;t accuse Trump of any crime. But the President&#8217;s lawyers were fuming that Trump was even mentioned by name while others were anonymized.</p>
<p>The Trump lawyers, led by Jay Sekulow and Jane Raskin, protested to Quarles, and the following day, they drove a few blocks to meet with Ed O&#8217;Callaghan, the senior official in Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein&#8217;s office, who led day-to-day oversight of the Mueller investigation.</p>
<p>Members of the President&#8217;s legal team were surprised that Mueller didn&#8217;t show up given that they had specifically requested to meet with him at the Justice Department, a person familiar with the meeting says, although Mueller had not directly promised to attend.</p>
<p>Corsi ultimately made the document public, but he didn&#8217;t sign a plea agreement and the special counsel&#8217;s office didn&#8217;t file any charges against him.<br />
As the investigation marched on, the Raskins dealt almost exclusively with Quarles over months of back and forth talks.</p>
<p>The fact that Mueller didn&#8217;t attend interviews of key witnesses or participate in certain meetings can be understood when his role is viewed through the prism of his history said one former official who worked closed with him.<br />
&#8220;The role that he&#8217;s most familiar with and has done most recently is FBI director &#8212; the leader of the investigators,&#8221; the former official explained. As a result, it would be &#8220;unrealistic&#8221; to expect Mueller to hover over his team.<br />
But that&#8217;s also not to say he&#8217;d be prone to let his team run over him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody rolls Bob Mueller,&#8221; said the former official.&#8221;</p>

<p>The longtime political stuntman Roger Stone faced an exasperated judge on Thursday, as his lawyers failed to gain traction with bold legal arguments criticizing special counsel Robert Mueller before Stone&#8217;s November criminal trial.</p>
<p>At the two-and-a-half-hour court hearing, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the DC District Court didn&#8217;t rule on requests Stone has made to puncture the case against him but got his legal team to admit flaws in almost all of their arguments.&#8221;</p>
