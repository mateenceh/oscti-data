		<h2 class="entry">NordVPN Breached</h2>
		<p>There was a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/hackers-steal-secret-crypto-keys-for-nordvpn-heres-what-we-know-so-far/">successful attack</a> against NordVPN:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on the command log, another of the leaked secret keys appeared to secure a private certificate authority that NordVPN used to issue digital certificates. Those certificates might be issued for other servers in NordVPN&#8217;s network or for a variety of other sensitive purposes. The name of the third certificate suggested it could also have been used for many different sensitive purposes, including securing the server that was compromised in the breach.</p>
<p>The revelations came as evidence surfaced suggesting that two rival VPN services, TorGuard and VikingVPN, also experienced breaches that leaked encryption keys. In a <a href="https://torguard.net/blog/why-torguards-network-is-secure-after-an-isolated-2017-server-breach/">statement</a>, TorGuard said a secret key for a transport layer security certificate for *.torguardvpnaccess.com was stolen. The theft happened in a 2017 server breach. The stolen data related to a squid proxy certificate.</p>
<p>TorGuard officials <a href="https://twitter.com/TorGuard/status/1186370296359587840">said on Twitter</a> that the private key was not on the affected server and that attackers &#8220;could do nothing with those keys.&#8221; Monday&#8217;s statement went on to say TorGuard didn&#8217;t remove the compromised server until early 2018. TorGuard also said it learned of VPN breaches last May, &#8220;and in a related development we <a href="https://torguard.net/blog/when-bug-bounties-border-on-blackmail/">filed a legal complaint against NordVPN</a>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The breach happened nineteen months ago, but the company is only just disclosing it to the public. We don&#8217;t know exactly what was stolen and how it affects VPN security. More details are needed.</p>
<p>VPNs are a shadowy world. We use them to protect our Internet traffic when we&#8217;re on a network we don&#8217;t trust, but we&#8217;re forced to trust the VPN instead. Recommendations <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/aiming-for-anonymity-ars-assesses-the-state-of-vpns-in-2016/">are</a> <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-vpn-service/">hard</a>. NordVPN&#8217;s <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">website</a> says that the company is based in Panama. Do we have any reason to trust it at all?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious what VPNs others use, and why they should be believed to be trustworthy.</p>

				<p>I use Private Internet Access. The company’s based in the US (last I heard), but their technical setup (dozens of servers worldwide with shared IPs, DNS leak protection, killswitch, AES-256/RSA-4096), their proactive measures to protect their userbase (they’re quick to pull out of jurisdictions that log Internet activity, like <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/forum/discussion/21779/we-are-removing-our-russian-presence" rel="nofollow ugc">Russia</a> and more recently <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2019/10/we-are-removing-our-johannesburg-south-africa-and-brazil-exit-gateways/" rel="nofollow ugc">Brazil</a>), and – most of all for me – the fact that their no-logging policy was <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-providers-no-logging-claims-tested-in-fbi-case-160312/" rel="nofollow ugc">proven</a> in court <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/private-internet-access-no-logging-claims-proven-true-again-in-court-180606/" rel="nofollow ugc">twice over</a> was all enough to persuade me they mean business about privacy and aren’t likely to sell their users out.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m just a layman who doesn’t want advertisers or common crooks snooping on me, so take all that for what it’s worth.</p>

				<p>ProtonVPN<br />
Reasons for choosing:<br />
&#8211; began with ProtonMail, a trust no-one mail provider<br />
&#8211; Swiss based, independently audited, not logged<br />
&#8211; founders began project at CERN</p>
<p>Despite this, any VPN is based on trust of that entity. For me given https is more prevalent (thanks let&#8217;s encrypt), the main reason for a VPN is the DNS traffic. However, DoH (DNS over HTTPS) could render a VPN useless for me but I have privacy concerns (encrypted yes but dns data logged) with DoH at the moment given it is evolving into a centralised DNS store (mainly cloudflare). DIY DNS servers (hard for many) with DoH or a distributed DoH (ISPs adding this) is the best path for security and privacy.</p>

				<p>@ Bruce,</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m curious what VPNs others use, and why they should be believed to be trustworthy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless I&#8217;ve set them up myself and maintain them, I won&#8217;t use them for security related purposes.</p>
<p>They are however sometimes usefull for doing service availability testing if you can force the &#8220;end point&#8221; location to be where you want rather than a provider wants.</p>
<p>But the simple fact is that VPN&#8217;s are just tunnels with known end points, this does not exactly make them secure against a whole host of &#8220;communications attacks&#8221; rather than &#8220;message content attacks&#8221;. But with large file sizes some types of message content attacks become fairly trivial (ie what sound file or cat video you&#8217;ve downloaded).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not awate of any VPN&#8217;s that take security measures that were first worked out as being a necessary minimum back in WWII to prevent &#8220;communications attacks&#8221;.</p>
<p>One way to in theory increase your security is to use multiple VPN&#8217;s in a chain it&#8217;s not unrelated to things various crackers have used over the years to obfuscate their communications path to try to prevent &#8220;trace back&#8221;. As those who can remember back to the FBI attack on Tor, even the most complex of comms path obfuscation fails if both end points are not secure, which most often is the case.</p>
<p>Whilst there are some business case uses for VPN&#8217;s they are often more to do with resource access control or monitoring rather than providing comms security.</p>
<p>Thus from a security mechanism perspective third party VPN services don&#8217;t actually offer very much to their customers rather than an &#8220;illusion&#8221; or &#8220;faux feel good factor&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Importantly remember that even if a service provider claims they don&#8217;t keep logs, they very probably do for a couple of reasons,</p>
<p>1, Technical quality control<br />
2, Because the software they use generates them automatically and lumps way to much information in the logs.</p>
<p>These are &#8220;Third Party Business Records&#8221; and as such have no legal protection in many jurisdictions. Worse what might appear to be anonymous records with no PII etc in them, history has shown can very easily be de-anonymized when compared to logs other third party service providers you have no knowledge of hold.</p>
<p>Thus I would urge people do a sensible business case assesment on their reasons for using a third party VPN service provider&#8230;</p>

				<p>Like Jac, my go-to VPN is ProtonVPN (free version) for the same reasons. I do pay for ProtonMail.</p>
<p>I  currently use KeepSolid VPN, and have used IPVanish. IPVanish was bundled in  with the portable VPN WiFi hotspot router &#8216;InvizBox Go&#8217;. I like the consistency network gateway security boxes provides to all connected hosts on my home LAN. [Invizbox&#8217;s new generation of routers will give me more deployment options e.g. hotspots for TOR, no VPN, VPN in city X, VPN in country Y or other variations.]</p>
<p>But&#8230; I don&#8217;t really trust anyone&#8217;s VPN technology fully. So I mix it up by using my two VPN providers in a random manner as possible. I don&#8217;t know if that is self-delusion or not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t put all your eggs in one basket&#8221;. Beware: too much trust in US/UK hosted VPNs. Perhaps it is marginally safer to trust the Swiss more than others.</p>

				</p>

				<p>this is a silly discussion. your question implies that if we use the VPN provider then we blindly trust them, and this thread is now becoming very PR-driven.</p>
<p>“my provider doesn’t log activities”. “mine is based on the moon” (but has exit nodes = servers in the US. so corporate location isn’t so relevant).</p>
<p>I think that there needs to be a larger discussion about “trust” and how we as consumers can’t audit every piece of the communication puzzle.</p>

				<p>I use 1.1.1.1 and Warp. The former is DNS over HTTPS, which is better than the status quo. The latter is a caching proxy, not really privacy-centric, but better than leaving it to the ISP.</p>
<p>I trust them at least a little because they&#8217;ve given detailed postmortems of network outages (transparency), I see their engineers on Twitter talking openly about their work (ditto), and they say they hire external auditors (though I haven&#8217;t seen the reports).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an almost zero-effort approach that provides basic protection from my ISP.</p>

				<p>I like PIA because like the first poster said it has a proven no log record.  NordVPN and Proton have sketchy ties, and they did a poor job hiding it with a story that changed daily, so I don’t know why people are recommending either of them.</p>

				<blockquote><p>
I&#8217;m curious what VPNs others use, and why they should be believed to be trustworthy.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Another question is WHY people use VPNs, and how much trust their reasons actually require.</p>
<p>My guess is that most people using VPNs do it to access something they can&#8217;t otherwise, whether it&#8217;s company-internal resources or region-restricted content. These use-cases don&#8217;t require much trust, because the point is access rather than either privacy or security.</p>

				<p>I use my own OpenVPN server, experimenting with OBFS4 not sure where its going, but it adds some coolfactor&#8230;</p>
<p>I guess what must be asked is what are you using the VPN for exacly, if its to hide traffic from a public WiFi Spot or to access some specific data that has a country block set.</p>
<p>As for logging i would say just forget about the sweet talk, if the shit hits the fan there will be a log provided against you.<br />
So personaly i dont need to access any specific countries lets say TV shows or similar, so not seing any point of using a third party, that would be the only case scenario where it would be justified to use one of those.</p>
<p>Getting to a computer at home, is easier with a VPN than using SSH so thats what i use it for, sometimes with split tunneling sometimes not, and if you need to hide from a WIFI it works to do that very well.</p>
<p>What more do one need really anonymity ? I would say not exactly possible to do that with this VPN approach, something else is needed for that completely.</p>
<p>Anyways if you dont have any possibility to make your own VPN<br />
take what ever is free, but remember it will only hide the traffic from your endpoint to the point where the VPN tunnel terminates, after that point its in the clear<br />
So who is your adversary is a key question</p>

				<p>&#8220;From a technical perspective, WARP is a VPN.</p>
<p>But it is designed for a very different audience than a traditional VPN.</p>
<p>WARP is not designed to allow you to access geo-restricted content when you&#8217;re traveling.</p>
<p>It will not hide your IP address from the websites you visit.&#8221;</p>

				<p>@ Yet another reader,</p>
<blockquote><p>I do not expect perfect. I expect to make it harder for people to surveil me.</p></blockquote>
<p>You do not say who you mean by &#8220;people&#8221; or what you regard as &#8220;surveil&#8221;.</p>
<p>Normal VPNs do not provide anonymity nor do they offer much in the way of traffic obfuscation.</p>
<p>By and large DNS traffic can be spotted even when done through a VPN tunnel as for traffic patterns, single user computers likewise trnd to give away many users activities.</p>
<p>Tor is due to low latency and other issues not realy that much better it&#8217;s famed anonymity has been broken a number of times, and for various reasons not something I would consider using. In particular because using it brings a spot light on yourself.</p>
<p>In the past people have talked about using VPNs to access Tor&#8230;</p>
<p>The point is unless there are a lot of people doing that it would not take you many sessions of doing so for the usage to get cross corelated&#8230;</p>
<p>The whole,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; make it harder for people to surveil &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Only applies to those type 1 and some type 2 actors. Whilst type 3 actors were once seen as &#8220;State Level&#8221; actors this is nolonger true the likes of Alphabet&#8217;s Google are moving into backbone and similar thus on many respects are supranational thus more surveillance capable than most traditional nation state type 3 actors.</p>

				<p>@Frank, Norton&#8217;s definition is overly-restrictive and yet over-promises (&#8220;virtually untraceable&#8221;?).</p>
<p>1.1.1.1/Warp shields me from my ISP which I have no doubt would bundle browsing history with my PII and sell it to the highest bidder. That&#8217;s a level of surveillance not possible for the individual sites which can see my actual IP address.</p>
<p>Plus their CEO&#8217;s Twitter account responded within hours to my question about an audit report: <a href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1187030459684835328" rel="nofollow ugc">https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1187030459684835328</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a less-than-satisfying response, but much better than I&#8217;d get from an ISP.</p>
<p>My threat profile is <em>very</em> minimal. Obviously Cloudflare&#8217;s products won&#8217;t help people trying to achieve robust pseudonymity. Perhaps the false sense of security among NordVPN users is more damaging than the smaller feature set of offerings that promise less.</p>

<p>Your conflating VPNs the technology and VPNs that are managed by others.  VPNs the technology helps with a lot of issues.  And HTTPS isn&#8217;t private.  The web site you are visiting is right there in the header of the request.  Which means everyone knows exactly where you are going.  And your ISP or Country can monitor it and block it.</p>

				<p>I use PIA to connect through my firewall and then I use DNS over HTTPS for an extra layer of privacy, even if for some reason they are required to keep logs (which they claim they don&#8217;t). Since I am mostly using it to keep my ISP from mining my data it suits.</p>

				<p>I use wireguard on my laptops to send all traffic other than DHCP over a wireguard tunnel to my home router. This allows me to give my laptops static IP addresses no matter where they are located. Captive portals don&#8217;t work out of the box and need manual changes to get them work before turning things back on. This allows me to be identified, but doesn&#8217;t let the host get to know much about what I&#8217;m doing.</p>

				<p>You can&#8217;t trust any VPN server you did not create yourself. Period.</p>
<p>Given how cheap it is to set up a VPN service, and given the antipathy every government has toward encryption and internet traffic they can&#8217;t read, it is more likely than not that many commercial VPN services are operated by intelligence agencies.  Why bother with breaking encryption or getting warrants when you can just set up a VPN, market it with all the buzzwords (&#8220;no logs!&#8221; &#8220;servers in Encryptistan!&#8221;), then sit back and accumulate users who naively think they are now invisible on the internet.</p>
<p>If you put yourself in the shoes of an intelligence agency, it&#8217;s a no brainer.  They have secret budgets, they&#8217;re allowed to lie, and they operate with impunity even when misdeeds are exposed.  Why wouldn&#8217;t you set up dozens of fake commercial VPN services?</p>

				<p>This clearly is the work of a nation-state, no one burn 0days for an operation that brings intelligence not profit. It is hard to understand why would anyone use a VPN ? The VPN is by design not secure. Of course it depends on your threat model, a VPN will help you safeguard data against low level adversaries who want to sniff your traffic. But the design is inherently insecure and anyone with the right tools and some money to burn on 0days can sniff VPN data. There are much better alternatives that are complete FREE and you don&#8217;t have to pay anything</p>

				<p>Lol. All the people (many of who are likely Americans) using PIA to protect their privacy. PIA is based in the USA, a 5 eyes country. The US doesn&#8217;t have a good track record on privacy. Your information is less likely to be shared with the same companies/government if its not located in the same country. Plus PIA has been involved in some pretty shady stuff, just search reddit.</p>

				<p>AirVPN and ExpressVPN, mainly to (a) change my reported geo-location as needed, (b) provide some hacking resistance when using wifi (c) stop my ISP from detecting when I&#8217;m using YouTube and then down-throttling the connection.</p>
<p>I use OpenVPN to access my home network, locally and remotely. My main concern is being hacked via a wifi connection.</p>
<p>Rightly or wrongly, I do not trust plain vanilla wifi, and refuse to use wireless keyboards and mice.</p>

				<p>I used a self-managed wireguard installation on a rented VPS. The problem, of course, is that I don&#8217;t really trust the VPS provider. At least not in the face of a NSL. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d backdoor me on the say-so of the copyright cops.</p>
<p>@Steve Perry: I&#8217;d like to hear about this VPS provider of yours.</p>

				<p>Maybe it’s a good time to start using NordVPN as they have had time to learn their lesson and harden their servers ?????</p>
<p>On a more serious note, it will come as no surprise that i also use ProtonVPN as some of the others have already identified it as one of the best alternatives out there.</p>
<p>I think that it offers a reasonable level of protection against all but most capable adversaries and as such a good choice for your average internet user.</p>

				<p>@Matteo:  https is th correct way to protect your internet navigation because it&#8217;s end to end</p>
<p>While I was in China, adjusting my bank account outside China, the thought occurred to me that with the calculation power in the Great Firewall, it might be relatively trivial to do a MITM job with TLS handshakes in both directions. The triviality comes from stolen/forged certificates. But my few dollars wouldn&#8217;t be worth their while, nor mine to use a VPN. If they&#8217;ve got tabs on you they just block your VPN.</p>

				<p>PIA. As others have said, it has stood the test of a couple of court cases. Using PIA&#8217;s DNS. Occasionally Windscribe or Proton (free) for web browsing, just to mix the pot a little. Regularly change servers.  They&#8217;re probably not protection against state-level attack, but I&#8217;m not particularly worried about that.</p>
<p>Why? To withhold info from my ISP, as part of muddying the waters against website-running snoops, occasionally to get around geolocation, and because I share files. I have not received any takedown notice in the decade I&#8217;ve been using PIA.</p>

				<p>I have three VPNs.  One of them, built using strongSwan, is targeted for a small subset of devices owned by my research group at the University.  Another one, built using OpenVPN, is flexible enough to home all class of devices (Linux (CentOS, RedHat, Gentoo and Ubuntu), Windows, OS X, iOS, Android and OpenBSD).  It is used to link together certain data adquisition equipment, usually buried in the forests all over the country.  I do not think these technologies are highly secure, but they are much better than not running a VPN.  Of course, all systems are firewalled, and not remotely reachable by other means.</p>
<p>Another VPN, much more restrictive, built using software available on the OpenBSD base system only links four small computer rooms with equipment that runs on the OpenBSD operating system.  All these computer rooms are firewalled by both pf(4) and, usually, Junos.</p>
<p>At last, sometimes I build short-lived VPNs (these ones usually do not last more than a few hours) using OpenSSH to connect to remote TCP ports and Unix sockets.  Very handy.</p>

<p>with vpn you only move the problem, now it&#8217;s a different country that can monitor and block it: now it&#8217;s from the vpn end point (included) to the website instead from your home to the website.<br />
if you use to bypass a block it will work, but if you use it to avoid people knowing which websites you visit vpn is useless.<br />
also note that the only information leaked by https is domain (not full url) and ip, if you enable encrypted SNI only the ip address.</p>

<p>why it&#8217;s trivial with https but not vpn? both use public key and the vpn public key/configuration is downloaded from a https website.</p>

				<p>@dimi<br />
in fact i&#8217;m using my raspberry, also the network should be treated as unsafe/untrusted <em>always</em> there is really no reason except bypass a block to get a vpn.<br />
they will not make your traffic any safer because they can not cover the whole path exactly like your wifi passowrd doesn&#8217;t make your connections safe because it cover only the first 50 meters of the path.<br />
what about the rest?<br />
https solves the problem it begins on your computer and ends on destination computer: end-to-end. this! works.</p>

				<p><i>I&#8217;m curious what VPNs others use, and why they should be believed to be trustworthy.</i></p>
<p>This past Winter, after several weeks of careful analysis, I choose <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/" rel="nofollow ugc"><strong>Mullvad</strong></a> as my VPN.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons I believe Mullvad is trustworthy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Website inspires a feeling of trustworthiness</strong><br />
The website is simple, uncluttered, to the point. No pop-ups, no trackers, no excessive cookies, no count-down timers to get the “deal of the day.”<br />
The company name, owners and principal employees are listed prominently.<br />
Mullvad has no affiliate program. Therefore VPN review sites receive no “kickback” for referring potential customers.<br />
Not a fly-by-night operation: in the VPN business since 2009.<br />
Supports the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology (CDT) VPN Questionnaire Project.</p>
<p><strong>Anonymous, numbered accounts</strong><br />
No name, email or other info needed for registration.<br />
Payment can also be anonymous.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br />
Mullvad’s VPN application is open-source software.<br />
Only offers the OpenVPN and WireGuard security protocols. (Unlike many VPNs, does not even provide the option of using the older and insecure PPTP.)<br />
Has submitted to a third-party audit.</p>
<p><strong>Highly rated on unbiased site</strong><br />
Mullvad is very highly rated on the only unbiased VPN info site of which I am aware: <a href="https://thatoneprivacysite.net" rel="nofollow ugc">ThatOnePrivacySite</a>.</p>

				<p>I guess I&#8217;m glad I dumped NordVPN a couple years ago after signing up for their 3 year plan on some kind of fire sale. I didn&#8217;t like that you had to use their client, and everything was too slow. This just confirms my decision.</p>
<p>Currently, I&#8217;m using iVPN.net for VPN service. I pay $99/year, and haven&#8217;t had any issues with the service. I Google around for them every few months to make sure the hasn&#8217;t been news of a breach, and I&#8217;ve been happy so far.</p>

				<p>My company had a team of interns implement in three months software the successfully de-cloaks traffic coming out of a VPN and maps it back to individual users and individual user devices. I was always skeptical about the effectiveness of VPNs, and that de-cloaking project cemented my doubts in stone. I no longer recommend any VPN products to my friends and family who are concerned about privacy or security. VPN traffic by its nature invites scrutiny, anyway.</p>

				<p>The reason for using a VPN is simple protection from the &#8220;sleepwet&#8221; we have in the Netherlands: the government is allowe to store my activity for five years if one of my neighbors Google &#8220;how to make a bomb&#8221; (not how it really works, but how it feels ;-))</p>
<p>AzireVPN has a great article on how they provide their own hardware to circumvent exactly the problem that NordVPN had, and include a patched kernel to keep root from being able to wiretap.</p>

				<p>GDPR is no guarantee of privacy.</p>
<p>It seems many people are unaware that after the original GDPR legislation was passed, it was so restrictive it caused ad networks problems.</p>
<p>Money talks, so very shortly after it appeared, several ammendments were made that basically neutured the original intent.</p>
<p>Now, as long as the privacy terms say that they&#8217;re harvesting all your data and your continued use (not explicit consent) is agreement to this, that is all that is required for &#8220;business as usual&#8221;.</p>
<p>GDPR is as useless as the cookie law, the only difference being explicit consent is not required; only continued use.</p>
<p>Basically: accept it, or don&#8217;t use the product/service.</p>
<p>The only companies being caught out are those who don&#8217;t say somewhere what they&#8217;re collecting. That is all that is required to comply.</p>
<p>I trust EU companies less than US companies, because the EU is more nefarious with its laws. In the UK there is RIPA Act. The rest of the EU has similar legislation.</p>
<p>The US actually has better protection of user rights within the USA than the EU. The problem is &#8220;rest of the world&#8221;.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t however think for a moment the EU has stronger privacy rights. That&#8217;s what they want you to believe.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t expect that my communication is secure from government agencies.  But even a cheap, iffy  VPN is fine for avoiding geotracking, packet inspection or insertion, etc.</p>

				<p>What to people mean when they say they set up own VPNs? I don&#8217;t understand. Do you have just happen to have a server on an island somewhere that you control, yet have no traces back to you? Who pays for the server? Is not &#8220;having internet in someone elses name&#8221; the same thing?</p>

<p>&#8220;What to people mean when they say they set up own VPNs? I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>All you need are a source and destination computer and some kind of secure link between the two of then.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing you are having problems getting your head about the destination computer?</p>
<p>Back in times past, Universities gave students VPN or equivalent capability, simply so that expensive software limited to a narrow IP address range could be ised by students whilst at home.</p>
<p>Many &#8216;web hosting&#8217; companies that offer Open Source Unix style user OS etc, their managment rarely if ever care if you setup the end of a VPN on the remote desktop.</p>
<p>In theory any cloud service could be used that way as well.</p>
<p>There are quite a few more options including Mix-nets and Onion- routing&#8230;</p>

				<p>Just come from Tom Scott&#8217;s &#8216;If VPN Ads Were Honest&#8217;.</p>
<p>He does a good job of fleshing out the threat model, and trade offs, for the average user.</p>

				<p>I use PIA. But I would never use it for anything that I wouldn&#8217;t do without it anyway. It is useful when I need to change my Geolocation info for some reason or when I do not trust the available ISP as much as PIA. So VPNs can be useful but nobody should trust their lives with them.</p>

				<p>Well, I&#8217;m still using NordVPN and I will use it. Yes, the breach should&#8217;ve been disclosed earlier, but looking from the companies perspective I would do the same. Especially knowing that they were checking every server for possible breaches, they had to make sure that everything is secure. Imagine if they really did release this immediately without checking, this would receive the attention of so many hackers, with the possibilty that there are still some holes in the security. I think everything is fine, and will be okay for the company. (only because they are taking this seriously and moving to RAM)</p>

				<p>I use one occasionally, but it&#8217;s more about protecting myself from my ISP, unknown WiFi networks, and Google than anything else. I don&#8217;t trust my VPN provider (or any others), and I&#8217;ve always suspected it may have connections to spy agencies. I operate with the assumption everyone is getting hacked at some point, and I do what I can to protect myself given that reality.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what I would do if my Internet privacy were literally a matter of life and death or my freedom as it is for those in China and many Middle Eastern countries.</p>
