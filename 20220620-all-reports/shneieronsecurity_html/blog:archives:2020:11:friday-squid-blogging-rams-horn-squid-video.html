				<p>Why the mRNA vaccines terrify me, and why I’m NEVER getting one</p>
<p>First and foremost, sorry for the extremely long post. If you read until the end, I thank you.</p>
<p>Now, we’ve all seen the mainstream media outlets being selective about the information they present regarding these mRNA vaccines. The companies spearheading this effort (namely Biontech, Pfeizer and Moderna) continue to boast their over 90% success rates, further giving the public reason to inject a rushed vaccine, using never-before-seen technology, available for human use in just under one year. Indeed, the mRNA technology has been in development for 30 years now with plenty of unsuccessful animal trials, and no human trials until this year!</p>
<p>The Powers That Be have effectively been able to take away the livelihoods, liberties and rights of billions of people with no accountability. Millions, if not billions of people have been overcome with desperation, depression, anxiety, hopelessness, poverty, and cynicism. It’s come to the point where many people acquiesce to these tyrannical restrictions, exclaiming to those around them, “Ugh, I can’t wait to just get that vaccine to go back to my normal life!”</p>
<p>This sentiment alarms me, because it accepts a false dichotomy of either unending, sporadic lockdowns or a vaccine imposed upon you by authoritarian governments that don’t really care about your health. It disgusts me that people are being forced into accepting one or the other. This alarm led me down a rabbit hole to studying the pathology of protein diseases, and to try figuring out why TPTB want to primarily use an mRNA vaccine so badly.</p>
<p>What Are Prion Proteins?</p>
<p>Proteins that prions are made of PrPc, or prion protein, which are normal proteins which occur mainly in the nervous system but are found throughout other tissues in the body. The infectious kind is called PrPsc. When misfolding of proteins occur, it becomes a malignant agent known as a prion, with the ability to transmit their misfolded shape onto normal variants of the same protein. Other proteins can exhibit prion-like behavior, but I’ll touch on that later.</p>
<p>What Are Prion Diseases?</p>
<p>According to the CDC, prions are considered “abnormal, pathogenic agents that are transmissible and are able to induce abnormal folding of specific normal cellular proteins called prion proteins that are found most abundantly in the brain.” Even the CDC admits, “the functions of normal prion proteins are still not completely understood.” Mad cow disease is probably the most well-known of the prion diseases, but neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s and certain forms of dementia have been revealed to be forms of prion disease as well. What’s terrifying about prion diseases is it’s highly infectious nature within the body. Just a singular prion can collapse nearby proteins into the same misfolded shape. This linear progression of protein collapse leads to disease. Oh, and guess what? Although prion disease is rare, it is fatal 100% of the time.</p>
<p>What’s important to note is that prion diseases have an exceptionally long incubation period. You can have prion disease and go five to up to twenty years without noticing signs of disease. However, once the proteins multiply and aggregate into amyloids, collections of these misfolded proteins, they collect in overabundance between nerve tissue, lead to a rapid deterioration in health, and unavoidable death.</p>
<p>So, little is known about PrP, why proteins misfold into prions and why amyloids lead to disease. It’s been discovered that other proteins, such as amyloid beta (implicated in Alzheimer’s disease) can misfold and lead to prion disease. And, surprise surprise, little is known about why this happens as well. Does this mean other proteins, not just protease-resistant proteins, are capable of exhibiting prion-like behavior and causing disease?</p>
<p>The role of Phosphatidylethanolamine and mRNA</p>
<p>This word is way too long, so from now on I’ll be referring to phosphatidylethanolamine as PDT.</p>
<p>PDT is a lipid found in all living beings. When PDT in food undergoes the Maillard reaction (what happens when food is browned and makes it taste so good, like cookies, breads, steak, etc) it rearranges into a more toxic form called an amadori product. Amadori-PDT’s cause oxidative stress and are higher in foods high in sugar, fat, and cooked to high temperatures. It’s also present in processed foods. You know, all that bad shit you shouldn’t be eating.</p>
<p>On a personal note—I’m not a believer in completely ridding yourself of these foods. I believe in balance, and as long as one strives to eat foods rich in nutrients and antioxidants to combat foods causing oxidative stress, you can lead a healthy, balanced life. Your body was designed to do just that!</p>
<p>Now, where am I going with this? How does it relate to prion disease? Well, guess what…PDT’s have been discovered to be a significant co-factor in propagation of infectious prions. This also makes me think about the standard diet in the majority of developed countries, and how these diets are rife with Amadori-PDTs. Why, instead of educating the public about the importance of nutrients and antioxidants, do they aggressively push the need for a vaccine?</p>
<p>Not only are PDTs a cofactor, but polyanions (single strand RNA molecules) are a crucial factor in the production of infectious prions. Without that single strand RNA, prions won’t have that high level of infectivity.</p>
<p>How this all relates to the vaccine</p>
<p>Although the vaccines appear to be shrouded in mystery, the companies do give us this bit of information: the vaccine uses messenger RNA to essentially “hijack” cells and encode it with the information to produce spike proteins. Cool, right? Except this coding is coming from the outside in, to create a protein from the inside out. A protein your body doesn’t naturally produce (I may be wrong on this). It’s bad enough that scientists admit the presence of foreign RNA could lead to an inflammatory response, thereby leading to autoimmune conditions that may permanently disable you. Either way, they’re taking advantage of the public’s ignorance and claiming that this is all just a natural process of your body (making proteins), there’s nothing to worry about, and that the vaccines are over 90% effective.</p>
<p>Side note—what are they considering effectiveness? The presence of antibodies? Because sure, they very well could be present, but what about how the incredibly complex ribosomes of your cells get altered by this RNA?</p>
<p>So, my questions are this. Why are we artificially introducing mRNA to change the way our cells express proteins? How do we know these proteins don’t have the potential to be malformed? We are aware the Standard Western Diet already has major health implications in neurodegenerative diseases, among other diseases (including COVID!!!), why aren’t we advocating for healthy, balanced living? How many of these shots do people need to take throughout their lifetime? Why is the vaccine so rushed when a potential disease to come of this new technology has an incubation period of at least five years? How do we know this vaccine can’t cause that? Why use this technology for COVID-19, a disease with an over 99% survival rate for the majority of the population? Why aren’t we opting for focused protection of the vulnerable? Why is it so hard to get a definitive answer if these vaccines will be mandatory? Why are our livelihoods being, essentially, held hostage?</p>
<p>Why now?</p>
<p>The risk to reward ratio doesn’t make sense. All this for a disease with a 99% survival rate?</p>
<p>Final Thoughts/Conspiracy Time</p>
<p>Perhaps I’m drawing too many conclusions in linking this RNA vaccine to potential prion disease. Still, you’re interfering with the natural mechanism of protein production in the body. Why would you want to tamper with such complex and delicate biological machinery? Machinery responsible for producing hundreds of the most complex compounds found in the human body, proteins? Remember, it only takes a small amount of malformed proteins to progress into fatal disease. Imagine giving these vaccines to a child and this happens. A child that’s 5 years old and needs this mRNA vaccine to go to school. What if prions develop and now their life expectancy is 25 years old? Could the world be seeing a mass extinction within the next 5 to 20 years from these vaccines?</p>
<p>I’m also aware that Gates and his family are known eugenicists, and there are theories floating around that TPTB want to cull the population by over 90%. It makes sense for them to permanently take away any sense of normalcy for the global population and giving them a promise to return to normal by getting one (or many) little harmless shots. It sounds so appealing. It’s mass psychological warfare, and they know it.</p>
<p>And no, I don’t believe the vaccine will take away your humanity, turn you away from God, or keep you from getting into heaven. I know TPTB have finessed the public into thinking the only people that are against vaccines are religious nuts, selfish idiot “Trumptards”, and woo-woo essential oil people that are “against science” and under the unfortunate influence of vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. Well, guess what. I was enlisted in the U.S. Air Force for four years stationed at a combat control squadron. I got injected with every vaccine known to man (with the exception of smallpox, since, ironically, the military knows it could give me a fatal reaction due to my eczema). I’m never getting this mRNA vaccine. It’s not the concept of vaccines that scare me, it’s the technology.</p>
<p>I would rather wear a mask for the rest of my life than be subject to this vaccine for this reason.</p>
<p>We are all capable of living happy, healthy, abundant lives through diets rich in nutrients, exercise, mindfulness and stress management. My body is biologically fine-tuned to thrive on these pillars of healthy living, and I refuse to let TPTB fool me into thinking my body is incapable of protecting itself, especially against a virus like this. I can’t be one of those people that just goes “Just let the doomers terrified of COVID take the vaccine so we can all move on with our lives.” Everyone needs to be aware of the potential dangers of this vaccine. The dangers that the mainstream media refuse to acknowledge, because TPTB won’t allow it.</p>
<p>Please, do your own research to decide for yourself if this is worth it. We have had too many instances of “trusting the science” too quickly that lead to biological and environmental disasters. I can’t let this be another one of those instances.</p>
<p>TL;DR mRNA vaccine instructs your cells to make protein it doesn’t normally make. Could be malformed. Malformed proteins can lead to prion disease. I don’t trust it. Also, Certain lipids and RNA strands are building blocks of prion formation. RNA is in the vaccine. Certain lipids are in your body and potentially in the vaccine. I don&#8217;t trust it.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;A device connected to my heart could save my life. It could also be hacked&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Yup, it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m acutely aware of&#8230;</p>
<p>I used to work in Medical Electronics a number of decades ago and trust me when I say that I was the only one who even thought about security back then and nobody wanted to talk about it (in fact loosing your job was a probable outcome of talking about it, based on the issues I had trying to just get simple checksums and error correction added for safety).</p>
<p>Back then it was very low power lowish frequency RF carying old style what many call ASCII serial text equivalent to that found on RS232 lines. Thus by a three transistor receiver and single transistor level shifter for TX and RX you could talk to early medical devices from a VT52 terminal&#8230;</p>
<p>Things have not got any better not just because of the reasons identified in the article, but for two other reasons,</p>
<p>1, Crypto is CPU cycle expensive.<br />
2, Crypto makes test and development very much harder.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that lab equipment such as &#8220;communications test sets&#8221; might do Bluetooth, ZigBee etc but they do not do &#8220;crypto&#8221;&#8230; Thus the first thing the developers would have to develop is a crypto unit to go inbetween the RF test kit and any software development kit.</p>
<p>As that can be a slow and painfull process for most embedded system developers. So they do not do it, they are &#8220;Planetext all the way baby&#8221; as it&#8217;s not their &#8220;seat of the pants they are flying by&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Thus from a device developing organisation perspective, crypto which is needed for communications security,</p>
<p>1, Adds nothing to the product<br />
2, Makes the product more expensive<br />
3, Shortens the battery life.</p>
<p>So untill someone not just proves someone has been killed by implant-jacking, but also wins a very substantial awards court case, no real security will be added by such organisations&#8230;</p>
<p>Knowing this, and having had to have a heart device fitted after going through a similar event as the article author, I have resulting issues.</p>
<p>One of which being a consultant communications designer/engineer and enjoying the design of high power RF systems some of which have pulse repetition frequencies not to disimilar to that of a heart in VF I found myself effectively legaly locked out of employment in that area (see UK Health and Safety at Work Act). Which as you might imagine adds to any potential depression from the worries of having the damn thing fitted in the first place.</p>
<p>Anyway if you look back over this blog you will see I used to talk about implanted medical devices and their lack of security, but it was mostly a one sided conversation. That is most people appear compleatly disinterested in discussing it.</p>
<p>Which I suspect will change when the first successful court case happens, but by then it will be too late for 100&#8217;s of thousands of people. Who have these devices inside them they need to stay healthy but could be a bullet to the heart at any moment some moron decides it will be fun to make a spark gap generator or similar just for giggles&#8230;</p>
<p>As for the &#8220;but your not the VP&#8230;&#8221; line, my response is and I&#8217;ve said it to a Medtronic rep &#8220;He&#8217;s just another dumb hick replacable politician with an entitlement issue, which I&#8217;m not, therefor I&#8217;m more of a target&#8221;. It took a while for them to work out why that would be true. The article kind of skates by it where it notes the lack of autopsies carried out.</p>
<p>The US Secret Service would fully investigate an untimely death of a President or VP current or past, that&#8217;s their sworn legal duty. So as a potential target that lowers the odds of a President or VP being attacked this way considerably as they would not stop looking. As for all of us others, well the chances are you could kill twenty or thirty of us without any investigation what so ever. So for a serial killer yippidy do dah that&#8217;s twenty to thirty free throws for every maybe questioned&#8230; That puts you into &#8220;Harold Shipman&#8221; territory, with maybe 250+ kills before people put it all together.</p>

<p>The meeting was ended due to the breach, while a Foreign Affairs Council spokesman told RTL: &#8220;Such a breach is illegal and will be reported to the authorities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Frankly, the person allowing the partial log-in credentials to be broadcast on social media is the one who should be losing their security clearance, but because it is a politician, it won&#8217;t happen.</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm, ALL</p>
<p>With regards the &#8220;Beirut Port explosion investigation&#8221;</p>
<p>If I remember correctly we had a fair idea of what had happend before the dust had settled. That is it was legal bureaucracy doing &#8220;stupid&#8221; over &#8220;safety&#8221;.</p>
<p>OK we now know what some of the other things stored there were, but we still do not know why. That is were the fireworks and vehicle tyres othe &#8220;legal seizures&#8221; or was the warehouse just an out of the way dumping ground&#8230;</p>
<p>Whilst amonium nitrate (AN) is not realy an explosive it is a rather nice oxidizer but even when mixed with a fuel it&#8217;s still considered a &#8220;tertiary explosive&#8221; that is a blasting cap (primary) is insufficient to cause it to explode you need a secondary explosive like dynamite to get the required impulse energy to get over the hump.</p>
<p>Fireworks are generally low grade explosive based that burn at less than the speed of sound (gunpowder). As such not considered suitable explosives to make AN go high order even when mixed with a fuel such as carbon or hydro-carbons.</p>
<p>Thus the question arises as to what might have contaminated the AN to make it more sensitive (aluminium dust etc) or were there other items in the warehouse in very close proximity to the AN?&#8230;</p>
<p>So there is still more info required.</p>

<p>As Clive Robinson points out, pure ammonium nitrate requires quite a large energy input to make it detonate, however a reasonably small amount of contamination makes detonation more likely.</p>
<p>The storage regulations go into more detail:</p>
<blockquote><p>Only small amounts of contaminants are required to act as a catalyst, explaining the unpredictability of AN under fire conditions. As a result of the decomposition reactions of AN, the risk of an explosion is increased by heating AN in combination with contaminants, confinement or both. In a fire situation, pools of molten AN may be formed. If the molten mass becomes confined, such as in drains, pipes, plant or machinery, or combines with contaminants, it can explode.</p></blockquote>
<p>hxxps://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-06/documents/an_advisory_6-5-15.pdf</p>
<p>hxxps://miningandblasting.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/safe-storage-of-solid-ammonium-nitrate-code-of-practice.pdf</p>
<p>hxxps://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/2014-12-03</p>
<p>The pictures taken inside the warehouse show less than optimal storage of visibly contaminated material. Couple this with the tyres and fireworks stored in the same warehouse, and you get a risk of detonation of the ammonium nitrate if a fire starts, which appears to be exactly what happened.</p>
<p>Sometimes existence of regulations and their enforcement is important.</p>
<p>Cassie.</p>

				<p>@Space Life Form, xcv in Re Canadian Invasion</p>
<p>I recall when in the early 1970s there was a bit of tension between Canada and the U.S. caused by the discovery (or &#8220;unsealing&#8221;) of some documents that included detail battle plans (circa 1930, in the intermission of the World War) for an invasion of Canada. Much was made of such Yankee perfidy at the time, but just now I did a little &#8220;Research&#8221; (web searches) to find that there have been numerous such plans from both sides. The article that seems to summarize well:</p>
<p>hXXps://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/06/21/that-time-the-us-almost-went-to-war-with-canada-218881</p>
<p>I guess it&#8217;s just a nation-level equivalent of brothers squabbling over Thanksgiving dinner (or which day that would be)</p>

				<p>Clive, if no body else, is probably familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Affair" rel="nofollow ugc">Trent Affair</a> during the American Civil War.</p>
<p>Two Confederate diplomats made it through the blockade to Cuba, and there took passage on a British Royal Mail Ship RMS Trent to the UK.</p>
<p>The Trent was intercepted by a US Navy ship. The classic formalities of shots fired across the bow were observed and a boarding party arrested the diplomats.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if the Queen was Amused, but her government was not. From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The current resources in Canada consisted of five thousand regular troops and about an equal number of &#8220;ill-trained&#8221; militia of which only one-fifth were organized. During December the British managed to send 11,000 troops using 18 transport ships and by the end of the month they were prepared to send an additional 28,400 men. By the end of December, as the crisis ended, reinforcements had raised the count to 924 officers and 17,658 men against an anticipated American invasion of from 50,000 to 200,000 troops. Including the units sent overland and the British forces already in the Province of Canada, British field forces in the province would have amounted to nine infantry battalions and four field artillery batteries by mid-March, 1862, a force equivalent to three brigades (i.e., one division), with four infantry battalions and two field artillery batteries (the equivalent of two more brigades) split between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. There were also 12 batteries of garrison artillery – six in the Province of Canada, three in Nova Scotia, two in New Brunswick and one in Newfoundland—and three companies of engineers in Canada, plus various headquarters, service, and support elements including two battalions of the Military Train.</p>
<p>Five infantry battalions, three field artillery batteries, and six garrison artillery batteries moved by sea from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Saint John, New Brunswick, then overland by sleigh from Saint John to Riviere du Loup, Province of Canada, between January 1, 1862 and March 13, 1862. The 10-day-long overland passage, and the railway from Riviere du Loup to Ville du Quebec, was within a day&#8217;s march of the border (in some locations, the overland trail was almost within rifle shot from U.S. territory in Maine), so the British staff planned on deploying infantry to defend the road, if necessary. The 96th Regiment, traveling on the Calcutta, reached New Brunswick in February; the other half were forced to abandon their voyage in the Azores when their ship, the Victoria, nearly sank. The Headquarters staff, who landed in Halifax on 5 January 1862 after the crisis was over, decided to take a quicker route to Montreal and, covering up their military baggage labels to disguise their identities, took a Cunard steamer to Boston from where they caught the railway to Montreal.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Lincoln decided that he had enough on his plate without adding a northern front. Her Majesty&#8217;s Government discovered that actions that might be interpreted as supportive of the Confederacy would be decidedly unpopular. So everybody called the whole thing off and the Confederate diplomats were released to British diplomats.</p>
<p>One of the mid-nineteenth century reform bills was advanced as a result.</p>
<p>I just assume that every country with a military maintains plans for invading and being invaded by everybody in their neighborhood. Normally these are kept quiet to avoid embarassment.</p>

				<p>Russia&#8217;s &#8216;foreign agent&#8217; bill foreshadows civil society clampdown<br />
<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/russias-foreign-agent-bill-foreshadows-civil-society-clampdown/a-55688505" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.dw.com/en/russias-foreign-agent-bill-foreshadows-civil-society-clampdown/a-55688505</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Russia is looking to better protect itself from any suspected meddling from abroad. New proposed laws could target journalists, teachers and social media networks such as YouTube and Facebook.</p>
<p>For years, people in Russia who are involved in politics and<br />
===&gt;receive money from abroad have had to register as &#8220;foreign agents&#8221; with the relevant authorities. Every person or organization thus listed is obliged to send the authorities regular reports on their activities and expenditures.</p>
<p>The controversial designation &#8220;foreign agent&#8221; conjures up associations of espionage. So far, it has been applied particularly to NGOs and international media. But now this regulation could be expanded at the initiative of the committee in the upper house of Russia&#8217;s parliament that is responsible for protecting state sovereignty from external intervention.</p>
<p>All citizens and groups in Russia that are involved in political activities and ===&gt;receive financial support from abroad are to be obliged to call themselves &#8220;foreign agents,&#8221; according to the draft law. This extends the scope of the current procedure to include a large number of individual people.</p>
<p>It would mean that they could be banned from working as public servants or having access to confidential documents. If they run in elections, such candidates would have to publicly identify themselves as &#8220;foreign agents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just compare with:<br />
Foreign Agents Registration Act<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Agents_Registration_Act" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Agents_Registration_Act</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) is a United States law passed in 1938 requiring that agents representing the interests of foreign powers in a &#8220;political or quasi-political capacity&#8221; disclose their relationship with the foreign government and<br />
==&gt;information about related activities and finances.<br />
The purpose is to facilitate &#8220;evaluation by the government and the American people of the statements and activities of such persons.&#8221; The law is administered by the FARA Unit of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section (CES) in the National Security Division (NSD) of the United States Department of Justice.[1] As of 2007 the Justice Department reported there were approximately 1,700 lobbyists representing more than 100 countries before Congress, the White House and the federal government.[2]&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess the key in both is very old wisdom:<br />
&#8220;follow the money&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>From abroad. From a broad. From a Russian broad, presumably. There&#8217;s a lady with the usual complicity in organized crime, the братва, the мафия, etc.</p>
<p>The rest of us don&#8217;t know enough Russian to &#8220;meddle&#8221; in Russian affairs. It&#8217;s a spam problem. There are too many of them, they talk too much, and whatever it is, they&#8217;re always selling something that ought not to be sold.</p>

				<p>@ Ferritecore,</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t know if the Queen was Amused, but her government was not.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Queen was, as I understand it more than somewhat livid at what was going on and composed a blood and hellfire diplomatic reply. Part of her displeasure was the state of Europe[1] and the fact that her beloved consort Albert was quite ill. However as he had a better understanding of the realities of what was going on with regards the state of the various potential combatants, she asked Albert to apply his insight. Albert produced a more measured response, he realised that there was little that Britain could actually do with either land or sea based armed forces, as the border was to long to defend. But likewise the Unionists could not either, as contrary to what many think it was not &#8220;the Industrial might&#8221; of the north that was arming the Unionists but the satanic mills of Britain and that simply stopping selling the guns and importantly the saltpeter to the Unionists would render them at best a rag tag bunch of woodsmen having to worry about the indigenous population slitting their throats in the dark.</p>
<p>However the stress involved on Albert sick as he was may have been the last straw. He succumbed to the illness on the 14th of December 1861. It&#8217;s not entirly clear but some historians feel that Victoria never forgot or forgave those in the US.</p>
<p>[1] Due to the machinations of Otto Bismark, Europe was on the edge of going to war. Bismark wanted both Austria and France defeated so he could form his Greater Germany. For various reasons the French had neglected to maintain their land based armed forces at a significant strength, rediness or equiped. But worse they were actually more ceremonial than capability. Great at waving flags but had out of date weapons and equipment and lacked the ability to take in recruits and turn out soldiers with equipment to be a fighting force. However neither the French Politicians or other European leaders and politicians realised the state of decady of the French land forces. What had been seen and incorrectly understood was what was seen as French Naval prowess. But the reality was it realy was not prowess but dumb luck, short supply chains, and another more inferior than they looked opposition. Essentially naval warfare was transitioning from wooden sailing ships, through wooden steamships and a tiny handfull of &#8220;Ironclads&#8221;. Everyone was doing it badly, with the result that effectively there was a vaccum of capable naval forces so much so a little boy with a sling shot had a good chance of looking good&#8230; The biggest failing was coal, steam ships used tonnes of it very inificiantly, it took almost as long to load the bunkers as it took the furnaces to burn it up at fighting speeds. But worse steam took many hours to get from cold water to usable steam. Thus for doing blockade work the boilers had to be kept running night and day, to have a chance to catch ships trying to run a blockade. So steam ships could only blockade for a few days, not many months as the old sailing ships did just a decade or so before.</p>

<p>re: <i>COVID-19 outbreak traced to an air-transport shipping container</i></p>
<p>MSM report about an outbreak of COVID-19 in Shanghai Pudong International airport traced back to a shipping container transported by plane.   2 workers who cleaned the container (sans masks) became ill with a N.America strain of the virus.  There had been zero COVID-19 cases in the prior 5 months.</p>
<p>The authorities immediately began mass testing of everyone in the airport; only the cargo area was affected.</p>
<p>@Clive and others have had on-going posts about shipping container contamination.</p>
<p>A summary of previous cargo container + COVID-19 posts and official responses:</p>
<p>&emsp; * Unknown Source<br />
&emsp; * Not Traced to known local genome sequences<br />
&emsp; * Often concern reported about shipping containers<br />
&emsp; * Shipping containers are usually refrigerated containers<br />
&emsp; * Often happening at markets where shipping containers are used<br />
&emsp; * Often happening near ports where shipping containers are opened or stored<br />
&emsp; * Genome sequencing done but results not published in MSM<br />
&emsp; * Genome sequences say &#8220;Common to North America&#8221;<br />
&emsp; * No details about what was stored in the container<br />
&emsp; * No details about the condition of the container (new, used, rusted etc)<br />
&emsp; * No details on transport, or other places the container may have been<br />
&emsp; * Nearly 100% of follow on reports later say Not A Shipping Container<br />
&emsp; * Nearly 100% of follow on reports later say Source Not Found</p>

				<p><b>20 NOV 2020 &#8212; Health Security Dealt a Deadly Blow</b><br />
At the time of this reporting I describe events and statements from three days ago.</p>
<p>A nurse from Northern Nevada stopped by, for the purposes of simplicity and a snappy cliche, a local watering hole. All present were mask and social distancing by 3 meters with high velocity ventilation forced to the exterior door. What was truly shocking and concerning, but not unexpected, more like unwanted was the witness given. The nurse described fellow medical personnel both administrative and medical, including doctors, were making the rounds in and about the hospital without PPE. In recent weeks several of the medical personnel were admitted having contracted COVID-19 (both administrative and medical). The nurse, an African American, understood the demographic potential for harm and has continuously taken precautions but has not had much success with the staff. The nurse also mentioned that it was serious MAGA country. It really just pissed me off that professional personnel had not taken the pandemic environment around them seriously and probably put other patients at risk, and most likely deadly demise.</p>

I have to think this would effect organizations outside of Russia that are state owned. Would not RT (Russia Today) news agency be a potential source of &#8220;foreign agents&#8221; that fall under this edict?</p>

the mask you have to enter the shop, which is of course<br />
prohibited without a mask 🙂</p>

Thank you for input!</p>
<p>I just want to point your attention that both laws (RF and US) are accordion type which let LEAs on both side of the Atlantic Ocean applied them selectively.<br />
That is the most dangerous vector of those laws.<br />
When possibility of criminal responsibility is on the table, law should be as clear as possible even for high school graduate, but that is in my pipe dreams only.</p>

<blockquote><p>re : COVID-19 outbreak traced to an air-transport shipping container</p></blockquote>
<p>Why am I not surprised (other than some one has been honest about it at last).</p>
<p>But something that saddened me, the fact that they were not wearing masks&#8230; Even when there is not a pandemic in progress, masks, goggles, gloves, coverals and boots are considered normal in many places for the type of cleaning carried out as the cleaning agents and contaminates being removed can become airborne and cause the person harm (something people should consider when pressure washing their decking etc, do you realy want to be breathing in diluted droplets of contaminated animal and bird waste products?).</p>
<p>For those reading my previous comments on the potential for this disease vector you can see my reasoning, and so far as far as I&#8217;m aware no one has faulted the reasoning.</p>
<p>So this time I&#8217;m going to ask you to do reasoning by asking a question&#8230;</p>
<p>Given that lobbying and similar allegedly about &#8220;economic drivers&#8221; that gave rise to those in charge turning a blind eye to what was clearly a pandemic in progress at the begining of this year, does anyone think there may be grounds to think a further blind eye is being turned, this time to viable non human (fomite) transmission vectors?</p>
<p>And if &#8220;yes&#8221; a second question to consider &#8220;Why?&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t ask that people post replies, just that they think about things and try not to let emmotion or other things like &#8220;authority trust&#8221; get in the way of their thinking. That is just weigh the evidence and reasoning and consider why they might or might not be in agreement with public statments.</p>

				<p>China sends robotic spacecraft to collect moon rocks<br />
<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/china-sends-robotic-spacecraft-to-collect-moon-rocks/a-55705561" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.dw.com/en/china-sends-robotic-spacecraft-to-collect-moon-rocks/a-55705561</a></p>
<p>&#8220;China has launched an unmanned spacecraft ==&gt;that aims to retrieve rock and soil samples from the moon. It is the first such mission in several decades and comes as Beijing continues to step up its space program.</p>
<p>The Chang&#8217;e-5 spacecraft was carried into space by the Long March-5, China&#8217;s largest carrier rocket, which blasted off from Wenchang Space Launch Center on the southern Chinese island of Hainan at 4:30 a.m. Beijing time (Monday 2030 UTC). Launch commander Zhang Xueyu later said the takeoff was successful. The Chang&#8217;e-5 mission, coordinated by the China National Space Administration, is named after the ancient Chinese goddess of the moon.</p>
<p>If the spacecraft completes its task, it would make China the third country in the world to have retrieved lunar samples after the United States and the former Soviet Union.&#8221;</p>

<p>re: <i>this is almost like Catch-22 logic – in order to obtain the mask you have to enter the shop, which is of course prohibited without a mask (So first mask costs €9,600) </i></p>
<p>In the un-burnt part of California where I am, anything covering the nose+mouth counts as a &#8220;mask&#8221;.  It doesn&#8217;t have to be any particular kind of mask and most high-quality ones are not available to the general public.  You can run an old bandana over you nose like when you played Stick-Em-Up-Cowboy or you can tie an old tee-shirt, towel around your face and that counts.</p>
<p>Over on the ashes from millions of trees, most places can and do hand out masks if you don&#8217;t have one. Flap a hand and some will drop-kick-it over to you.</p>
<p>However, ongoing mask uses do cost and trying to find decent disposable gloves just isn&#8217;t happening any time soon.</p>
<p>If they demanded disposable gloves, we would be in a world of None.  Masks, not a problem.</p>
<p>From the Land of 1 Dead per Minute, where masks are unpatriotic, dying helps the economy and some places have 60% infection rates, and Anders Tegnell is having a celebration for &#8220;Light Touch In Action&#8221;.</p>

				<p>@ Anders, JonKnowsNothing, Clive, ALL</p>
<p>Wear a mask if you have to interact in public.  It really works.</p>
<p>hXXps://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2020/11/20/covid-cases-dropped-in-counties-with-mask-mandates-slu-study</p>
<p>&#8220;The two groups of counties, those with mask mandates and without, had very different experiences over the next three months, researchers observed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first three weeks after the mandates, the growth rate in St. Louis and St. Louis County was 44 percent lower than their three neighbors. The effect wasn&#8217;t a blip. It persisted for the next nine weeks of the study.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are some numbers from the link.  Note St. Louis City is like a county.  The stats are collected by county.  See the link above, it has a map.  People move between these 5 areas every day.  And this study only addresses the Missouri side of the St. Louis Metro Area.  Movement between Missouri and Illinois in the Metro Area is plenty also.  4 Interstate Highway bridges.</p>
<p>Here are some growth rates in cases, by county, from 2020-07-03 to 2020-11-13.</p>
<p>The first two had the mask mandates.  Think Blue.<br />
The last three had no mask mandates.  Think Red.  They border St. Louis County.</p>
<p>St. Louis City 294.4 percent<br />
St. Louis County 471.7 percent</p>
<p>St. Charles County 1,234.9 percent<br />
Jefferson County 1,437.6 percent<br />
Franklin County 1,573.3 percent</p>
<p>[of course, the Governor of Missouri is an idiot, and refuses to mandate mask wearing statewide]</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve talked to infectious disease doctors every week,&#8221; Parson said. &#8220;If you look at it from a medical perspective, they have a different view than what I do as the governor of the state Missouri.&#8221;</p>

				<p>A short lived post resulted in an Interesting tap out from the ether after a comment made its way onto the blog where conspiracy theories replaced rational thought and thoughtful discourse. This is the second time in 8 years where a interface here caused a mercurial meatspace-based reaction. Seem to be some sensitivities with some in the mid-west.</p>
<p>No issues, just the abnormal reactionary behavior without cause or reason. If concerned, I&#8217;d make a point of it&#8211;just a reflective note regarding the nature of modern communications and normative social attitudes.</p>

Didn&#8217;t know you suffered from pipe dreams. I sympathize as I suffer from recursive dreaming. Hopefully it&#8217;s not leaded pipes or heavy cast iron.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll fall asleep, enter REM and have a lucid experience; while in that dream I fall asleep and enter a second sleep state. It is when I wake up, the second dream state is okay, but, it is coming out of the second into the first&#8211;especially if it is successive quick&#8211;that I awake and attempt to catch my breath and assess my situation. Haven&#8217;t had three sleep state dreams and hope not to.</p>
<p>Reality represents enough subconscious feeds to keep most dreams interesting.</p>

				<p>It appears that NATO will now be running with limited visibility due to the end of the Open Skies treaty and the dismantling of the OC-135. This may not be an opportune time to make drastic changes to operational capabilities but that&#8217;s just me&#8230;</p>

<p>re: <i><br />
&emsp; * (Clive)&#8230;does anyone think there may be grounds to think a further blind eye is being turned, this time to viable non human (fomite) transmission vectors?</p>
<p>&emsp; *F-Spike/ΔFVI-spike mutation Y453F COVID-19 mutation<br />
</i></p>
<p>There are some loose ends swaving about and while reporters just &#8220;report&#8221;, a few are tumbling into information that means more than what they thought.  Serendipity.</p>
<p>Reports are beginning to drift up about the Global Presence of the F-Spike mutation.  It is now found in @10 countries, and on most continents.  The catalyst for these findings was the Y453F COVID-19 mutation outbreak in Denmark.  Circa 11/18/2020 Denmark uploaded 6,000 genomes to GISAID a public fronting genome strain database.</p>
<p>There is no requirement for science departments to share such information in public accessible databases. Sharing it with other entities is at the discretion of the government.  The Danish authority, SSI, shared the information with other governments in the EU (like Netherlands).</p>
<p>Finding out exactly what and how  the F-Spike/ΔFVI-spike mutation Y453F COVID-19 mutation worked, took me a good long while and load of grep (my google-fu not being up to google-standards).<br />
*note: others may have found it faster with better fu-bar-tools.</p>
<p>Once the Danish SSI uploaded their 6,000 genomes &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t long before the same mutations were noted elsewhere.  COVID-19 mutates all the time.  This is what makes the &#8220;strains&#8221; or nodes in the tree.  The current root is D614G and after that it is like squid tentacles with strains and variants flowing down forming lineages to end nodes.</p>
<p>Reports about human-mink mutation and the economic impacts for the fur trade, connected the dots to reports about humans with the same mutations.</p>
<p>Countries reported with Mink-COVID outbreaks (not a complete list)<br />
&emsp; * USA<br />
&emsp; * Spain<br />
&emsp; * Netherlands<br />
&emsp; * Denmark *F-Spike/ΔFVI-spike mutation Y453F<br />
&emsp; * Greece<br />
&emsp; * Poland<br />
&emsp; * South Africa<br />
&emsp; * Switzerland<br />
&emsp; * Faroe Islands<br />
&emsp; * Russia</p>
<p>Countries that now have confirmed Y453F mutations in humans. (11 18 2020)</p>
<p>&emsp; * Denmark 329<br />
&emsp; * Netherlands  6<br />
&emsp; * South Africa  2<br />
&emsp; * Switzerland  2<br />
&emsp; * Faroe Islands 1<br />
&emsp; * Russia 1<br />
&emsp; * USA Utah  2</p>
<p>There was some concern about the antibody escape mechanism of the F-spike mutations, especially the ΔFVI-spike mutation Y453F (try saying that fast 10 times or typing it).  This variant is now claimed extinct in Denmark after 30 days of &#8220;not finding the fish in the barrel&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mutation escape variants have happened and there are 20-40 known ones like N439K originally spotted in Scotland (now extinct there) but arising spontaneously in other countries.</p>
<p>&emsp; * There is a swaving loose end with the drum beat to take the First Vaccine Offered no matter the lack of testing or safety (Vaccine-Hesitant vs Anti-Vaxxers).</p>
<p>&emsp; * There is a swaving loose end about the findings of larger percentages of Asymptotic Infections (not divided into True Asymptotic or Pre-Symptomic).</p>
<p>&emsp; * There is a swaving loose end about First to Market and Market Capture PerCentages and Annual Vaccination Profits. (see Pfizer market bump and AstraZeneca market slump)</p>
<p>&emsp; * There is a swaving loose end about the dearth of information about the shipping container in &#8220;at the <b>UPS international transit center</b> at Pudong Airport.&#8221; Air ship containers are much smaller in size than the 40ft High Cube Sea Train containers. Air shipping containers travel at &#8220;air speed&#8221; around the globe vs a sea train that may take weeks or months to reach a destination.</p>
<p>&emsp; * There are swaving loose ends about health care workers and doctors getting COVID-19 while wearing full PPE.  These are often marked as &#8220;they did it wrong&#8221;, whereas some didn&#8217;t have any PPE at all and got marked for &#8220;non-use&#8221;.</p>
<p>&emsp; * There is the swaving loose end of gimmicked statistics such as the one that SpaceLifeForm helped ID about a Fuel Gauge Graphic.</p>
<p>We live in interesting times&#8230;.<br />
May we all live past the end of December 2020 to see the New Year on Jan 1, 2021.<br />
There will be a lot of people who won&#8217;t be there for the change over.</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<p>From the Quantas comment, this stands out like a hugh read flashing light,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;&#8230; that certifies what the vaccine is, <b>is it acceptable to the country you are travelling to</b>.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I can see various drug company lobbyists pushing that agenda to high profitability, and others using it to political advantage.</p>
<p>So far the most expensive COVID-19/20 vaccines per patient on the planet are the two US mRNA vaccines at something like nine or ten times the UK &#8220;oxford&#8221; conventional vaccine price.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve already said I&#8217;ve concerns over the mRNA vaccine, and that I&#8217;m not going to let an mRNA vaccine be put in my arm in anything less than five years. It&#8217;s up to others to make their minds up after doing their own research.</p>
<p>Others have expressed their own reasons for not accepting an mRNA vaccine (look up how they work before you make your mind up and you might see why).</p>
<p>Unlike the mRNA vaccines we know a reasonable amount about how conventional vaccines like the Oxford vaccine works, thus I&#8217;ve a lot less concern about them long term safety wise.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m happy to keep living a near issolated existance till I&#8217;m offered a conventional vaccine. Preferably one that is both efficatious and low cost.</p>
<p>Now if most people decide after reviewing the science not to go for mRNA then those two US companies are going to suffer the usuall &#8220;free-market&#8221; effects unless they are &#8220;propped up&#8221; in some way.</p>
<p>The idea of saying a country can decide what it accepts and does not except in the way of a vaccine will no doubt be causing some to see the &#8220;profit potential&#8221; or the &#8220;xenaphobic potential&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh and keep a careful eye on who gets those &#8220;free vaccines&#8221; promised, I suspect that some may well see advantages in giving it only to those they think will vote their way etc etc&#8230; After all why let a good pandemic go to waste.</p>

<p>May I ask in the spirit of reproducible research and free and open source software?</p>
<p>So that we &#8212; as common subjects of fascist America &#8212; can more properly learn the details of the patented proprietary vaccines and tests our betters are imposing on us by force against our will?</p>

@JonKnowsNothing *F-Spike/ΔFVI-spike mutation Y453F COVID-19 mutation</p>

<p>There are generic MSM reports such as these:</p>
<p>&emsp; * ht tps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/05/danish-covid-19-mink-variant-could-spark-new-pandemic-scientists-warn</p>

<p>&emsp; * ht tps://arstechnica.com/science/2020/11/dutch-scientists-reconstruct-spread-of-coronavirus-through-mink-farms/</p>
<p>Then there is the real deal data from the Danish SSI Authorities</p>
<p>&emsp; * ht tps://files.ssi.dk/Mink-cluster-5-short-report_AFO2</p>
<p>I think you may want the last one&#8230; I recommend a large hot pot of coffee when you parse it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d give you the links to the world veterinary authorities but I have not been able to bring up the site for some days.  I dunno if its a problem on their end or a problem with a Firefox update that cracked my system or if there&#8217;s some other blockage.  I&#8217;ve posted the links to them in the past but I dunno if those are still good or not.  The site has the &#8220;official reports&#8221; posted by associated government veterinary departments on all diseases that have global concerns like ASFV and Avian Flu and COVID-19 in animals.  That database holds the official reports from the mink outbreaks as filed by the country authorities. Makes for scintillating reading: Lion, tiger, Mink, Cat, Dog, Mink, Cat, Dog, Mink&#8230;</p>
<p>Here is the wikipedia entry for them:<br />

<p>re:<i>How not to bury 15MILL mink&#8230;</i></p>
<p>MSM Report (Agence France-Presse in Copenhagen)</p>
<p>The Great Danish Mink Cull is still in progress. 10MILL mink so far dumped into enormous trenches on a military training field outside the western town of Holstebro, Jutland, Denmark.</p>
<p>Someone forgot to put enough Topping on the Trenches and now they have burial gas ground heave with a lot of mink corpses rising out of their graves.</p>
<p>They also put the trenches near a lake. Downhill flows to the lake making for an unpleasant future.</p>
<p>The fix is monitor the site 24/7 until they put a fence up to stop the zombie mink from going decay-about.</p>
<p>note: While ground heave is normal under many circumstances, someone rather missed a few lines in their animal encyclopedia.  Carrion gets eaten and lots of animals will dug it up.</p>
<p>Normal fencing does not stop carrion birds and smaller animals from going over, under or through the fence.</p>
<p>Then after all of the normal decay process is done, there will be 10MILL mink bones in the pits for a good while. Unless they dig it up and process it for bone-meal and feed it back to livestock.</p>

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;re:How not to bury 15MILL mink…&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>The Guardian article misses something important, it&#8217;s not just the weight of the trench cover soil, it is the composition as well.</p>
<p>There are actually tables you can look up for depth of burial from the top of a shrouded corpse to the ground level, and whilst some for light sandy soil are less than 4ft that is for shallow stone covered graves.</p>
<p>The depth increases if the corpse is not shrouded or in a coffin or similar.</p>
<p>The soil around where I live requires a minimum of 2ft plus the depth of the corpse in shroud etc which puts you down into clay which brings up drainage issues.</p>
<p>Which in turn brings up the unpleasent question of corpse liquification and it&#8217;s side effects such as ground seepagge and others one of which can be liquefaction and thus materials rising up or through granular materials and appearing at the surface or in water courses etc.</p>
<p>None of this information is &#8220;unknown&#8221; and there are usually a fair number of experts in any given area (people dying does tend to happen where ever they inhabit). In the UK for instance if you want &#8220;a home&#8221; or &#8220;green&#8221; burial there are a number of associations that will advise on what you need to know as well as the method of internment and what not to plant etc and for how long after internment.</p>
<p>Most armies have fairly indepth health and hygiene guides for short medium and long term encampments in the field and officers are expected to memorise them. As warfare generally involves mortality the question of how you bury the fallen in various ways tends to be fairly well covered as does sanitation in general.</p>
<p>So why was this mistake made?</p>
<p>Although it was military ground, something tells me it was not the military doing the excavation and cover. Because they tend to ensure a job is done once, thus tend to err on the side of &#8220;over kill&#8221;.</p>
<p>I suspect when it&#8217;s examined it will be found it was &#8220;the lowest bidder&#8221; or similar monetary issue and people not using available domain knowledge&#8230;</p>

				<p>@ MarkH,</p>
<p>This might be of interest,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/25/easa_737_max_return/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/25/easa_737_max_return/</a></p>
<p>That is Boeing 737 MAX aircraft could be flying over Europe again in January 2021.</p>
<p>Essentially there is little change in the aircraft since over 350 lives were lost in two crashes where the MACS acted against the pilots wishes.</p>
<p>The major change appears to be the recertification of pilots that American Airlines so desperately wanted to avoid due to it&#8217;s cost when it effectively blackmailed Boeing into making a 737 with much larger engines that significantly changed the flight characteristics.</p>
<p>Two qurstions arise however,</p>
<p>1, Will passangers travel on it?<br />
2, Will airlines buy it?</p>
<p>COVID-19/20 has caused some major changes in the airline industry and the question of what flights will remain profitable enough to retain. Various pundidits have indicated thst they think that the life of the &#8220;super jets&#8221; are over as mass travel will remain restricted or unpopular.</p>
<p>But the jury appears out on the likes of the 737 and similar, and how passengers might react to the return of the 737 MAX.</p>
<p>I for one will not be flying on it or any other aircraft, so I&#8217;m not faced with making the choice. Some will not care as long as the ticket price is low enough but that is low profit high risk for an airline to bet on. Their money is made by business class not economy passengers. The forced use of &#8220;teleworking&#8221; during COVID may have a lasting effect afterwards with companies deciding &#8220;business trips&#8221; are not a necessity any longer at the overal cost. Which would tend to suggest that ticket prices will rise thus further making business class flights less attractive to companies.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not making any bets on where things are going to go but the one thing that is definate Boeing, Airbus and similar will be betting their future on the outcome of COVID and so will most airlines.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how they cover up the stink.</p>
<p>The cull was government ordered but the veterinarian services would have had something to say about how to do it.  The reports indicated they pulled in Warm-Bodies to do the cull work and that wasn&#8217;t done according to the Rule Book either.</p>
<p>Large Animal Vets normally know about how to bury horses and cows; Small Animal Vets may not be upto date on that part but they all know how to handle mass outbreaks of Hoof and Mouth and Other Mass Culls (ASFV) and proper disposal to avoid contamination of the environment.</p>
<p>There were some reports that the farmers were doing their own culls, burials or incineration. As the farmers deal with the problem of <b> What To Do With It After You Rip Off The Fuzzy Parts</b> on a yearly basis they probably have good protocols.</p>
<p>Someone did things on the cheap, maybe &#8217;cause the Danish Parliament was already squawking about the compensation due to the farmers so maybe they thought:<br />
&emsp;  &emsp;  No One Would See It<br />
and forgot<br />
&emsp;  &emsp;  Someone Might Smell It</p>

<p>I see you zapped the 359292 comment.  The nearly invisible post that I created as a test.</p>
<p>It appeared upon observation to look like this:</p>
<p>• November 25, 2020 1:50 AM</p>
<p>I do not know if you looked closely at it, but I would recommend the following rules for the name field.</p>
<p>Trim leading and trailing spaces.</p>
<p>Make sure all characters are 7-bit ASCII between 0x20 and 0x7E.  Printable ASCII.</p>
<p>This should not break anything, but can prevent future issues.</p>

				<p>@ name</p>
<p>So, you peeked.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still thinking about this, and so far, I cannot decide if it should be considered a bug or a feature.</p>
<p>Consider if the &#8216;text&#8217; inside is a signature.  Or something else.</p>
<p>With the various parsing filters in place, there actually could be issues.</p>
<p>Note that it is almost impossible to create an obvious visible signature due to markdown getting in the way.</p>
<p>If you view source on this post, check the chars surrounding the word text above.</p>
<p>They will not be 0X27.  Oh no!  The filters must parse, and change them.</p>
<p>Just like before, when 0x22 (double quote) were being changed to emoji. (fixed)</p>
<p>Above, I wrote &#8216;Testing&#8230;  and OK&#8217; using plain ASCII.  Just like here.</p>
<p>But, no.  The filters just had to change it to:</p>
<p>This is immediately before the pre block</p>
<p>&#8216;Testing&#8230;  and OK&#8217;</p>
<p>This is immediately after the pre block</p>
<p>Well, this is how braindead the filters are.  And or the order.<br />
The stuff above in the pre block is actual html.<br />
It is amper hash 8216 semi then Testing then amper hash 8239 semi space space and Ok amper hash 8217 semi</p>
<p>It is supposed to be pre mode.  Yet, the pre is being ignored.<br />
The stuff in the pre block is being parsed as html anyway.</p>
<p>Braindead.</p>
<p>So, the filters are doing two things here.</p>
<p>One is that it parses so well (it thinks) that it paired up the two single quotes and changed the first to the amper hash 8216 semi and the matching closing single quote to amper hash 8217 semi.</p>
<p>And, it also parsed the 3 dots and replaced with the amper hash 8239 semi.</p>
<p>This is insane!</p>
<p>There is zero reason to do that.</p>
<p>7-bit ASCII is VALID UTF-8.  This site is UTF-8.</p>
<p>Why go thru the overhead?</p>

<p>re: <i>How to keep the mink down in the dirt&#8230; </i></p>
<p>On going circus over the burial (sort of burial) of the 10-17MILL mink from the Danish F-spike mutation cull.</p>
<p>recap: The mink cull is still in progress.  They dumped the dead mink carcasses in huge trenches dug on a military training base (they are still dumping them).  The folks in-charge of making sure the dead mink stay in the trench did not cover them with enough dirt (1). The natural decomposition gases caused ground-heave where the dead mink are floating up to the surface.  The trenches are also near a lake.</p>
<blockquote><p>@Clive: Which in turn brings up the unpleasant question of corpse liquification and it’s side effects such as ground seepage and others one of which can be liquefaction and thus materials rising up or through granular materials and appearing at the surface or in water courses etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems that the Danish Government has been paying attention to Clive&#8230;</p>
<p>The Danish Government is now considering exhuming all the dead mink and running their remains thru incinerators.  The MPs need to get environment approvals to burn the carcasses and remaining batches from the 10-17MILL mink.  They also have to figure out what to do with the &#8220;cremains&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they will like the smell of burning fur much better.</p>
<p>1, Image of the trenches indicate that they may have lined the pits with QuickLime or similar.</p>

&emsp; Disposal of corpses: Historically, it was believed that quicklime was efficacious in accelerating the decomposition of corpses. This was quite mistaken, and the application of quicklime can even promote preservation; although it can help eradicate the stench of decomposition, which may have led people to suppose it was the actual flesh which had been consumed.</p>

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing,</p>
<blockquote><p>Historically, it was believed that quicklime was efficacious in accelerating the decomposition of corpses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes it can help break the surfaces down in small quantities, but if you kill the bacteria that are actually munching on the meat as it were then it slows things down (it&#8217;s why you can cure meats to preserve them almost indefinitely[1].</p>
<p>Now experiments have shown if you want to break the flesh of a corpse down, biological laundry/washing powder is quite helpful&#8230; You can do an experiment with a couple of pork chops and a couple of zip-lock bags. Put a chop in each bag and add a reasonable quantity of biological powder to one and quicklime to another mark the bags appropriately and chuck them in a hole in your garden or some other outside place where animals can not get at them. You will be surprised at just how fast that biological powder is&#8230;</p>
<p>Somewhere online is a thesis from a student working at a US &#8220;body farm&#8221; that goes into great detail of disposing of corpses both quickly and relatively safely (and in a more environmental way).</p>
<p>The problem with incineration is that bodies are mostly water. And they realy do not burn very well untill they have dried out thus 1400F is one of the tempratures they recomend you do not drop below when cremating. This has to be maintained for around 1min/lb body weight plus an initial rise time (which I can not remember off the top of my head). Obviously this is an intently energy ineficient process[2] and thus quite expensive and environmentaly undesirable.</p>
<p>Any way, now many readers are probably looking a little &#8220;green around the gills&#8221; comes the even less pleasant and rather more vexed question of how to safely remove the mink. One of the downsides of corpses is &#8220;grave gas&#8221; and corpses have been known to explode fairly widely[3]. Thus quite a bit more care has to be taken handeling them than when dealing with fresh carcasses, especially as they are likely to be much more infested with pathogens.</p>
<p>[1] The curing process kills the bacteria in various ways. Then as the meat eventually dries out to something not to disimilar to wood/gristle, it leaves the meat in a state inhospitable to the bacteria &#8216;re-colonizing. You can make the result slightly more edible by adding fat and various other things you will find in pemmican and salami mixtures.</p>
<p>[2] Desicated or preserved corpses such as those that have been mummified or equivalent can actually produce quite a bit of energy when burnt. Such bodies tend to be a nuisance after quite a short time which is why after 50-150years they can be disinterned and disposed of. Back in the 1980&#8217;s India had a power station that used such remains as part of the fuel source.</p>
<p>[3] Corpses exploding can be a bit embarrassing when they do it at their funerals as happened to William the conquere or in their coffins as King Henry VIII did. In the first case it splattered over the mourners and in the second case split the lead lining and apparently dogs and other creatures lapped up the seepage&#8230; I suspect few weeped or even mourned the two men as they were both extreamly brutal and very much debauched in various ways, hence the increased risk of exploding.</p>

For quite some time I have come to understand that tokenizing syntaxes are useful for multi language sites that can provided translated source material. It would be a feature in WordPress that provides linguistic abstractions. It&#8217;s my guess and am sure a quick google/duck/bing/yahoo/webcrawler search would be instructive.</p>
<p>Good work by the way, making things work in interesting and producing useful applications. You&#8217;ve done both, I see an GNU or PGP sub signed comment that can be managed with offline public key exchanges. It is really making a time-based OTP that would be the most useful&#8230;and I have some ideas.</p>

<p>The Persian translate probably parses incorrectly because it is RTL written language and I believe I should have done the C+P in 2 or 3 steps.  I think I messed that up.</p>
<p>They are google translates.</p>
<p>In order:</p>
<p>Estonian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, German, Greek, Persian, French, Simplified Chinese, English.</p>
<p>Note that you can read and see it all.  It is all UTF-8.</p>
<p>Parsing and understanding is an exercise left for the reader.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> the Persian translate should look like below.</p>
<p>Interesting.  Firefox thinks it knows what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Incorrectly.  First, I pasted a chunk.  Then when I wanted to paste the other chunk, Firefox saw that it was a RTL written language, so it would paste into the left-hand side of what I already pasted, even though my cursor was one the right-hand side.</p>
<p>So, it looks like Firefox is interpreting on the fly.</p>
<p>Anyway, I did it in two chunks, out of order from what I thought made sense.</p>
<p>I am curious.  Some reader here knows Persian.</p>
<p>Does the below now make syntactical and grammatical sense?</p>
<p>Besides the fact that it is not right justified?</p>

<p>Hmm it&#8217;s an early hour and all appears quiet on the &#8220;bus front&#8221; so far, unless you&#8217;ve heard anything new.</p>
<p>Speaking of busses and Kraken&#8217;s throwing wild nonsense around. It appears a more local Kraken has reared it&#8217;s head in attack mode yet again, and is both full of it and making a nuisance of it&#8217;s self via it&#8217;s deluisions of speaking for it&#8217;s deity, though I don&#8217;t think this one has &#8220;little hands&#8221; or is orange though. Any way it is doing it&#8217;s undesirable thing again of throwing it&#8217;s tentacles about. You might have noticed a comment that someone has posted. I suspect Like them there are nodoubt several others taking cover. I&#8217;ve no wish to be in the firing line for even strays of such abuse which has happened before. So I would not be surprised if regulars do what they did last time and go into lurk mode till things get cleared up somewhat. It seems a prudent thing to do so I&#8217;m going to go into lurk mode in the big comfy chair with a big bowl of popcorn and watch which way it plays out. Hopefully it will be home team won Kraken nill, without having to go to the judges.</p>
<p>As for the demigod &#8220;orange little hands&#8221; that&#8217;s a whole other bowl of popcorn, all appears to be quiet for now whilst the first contest keeps failing to get out of the starters gate. No doubt when the money stops flowing in a different contest with different sacrificial players will start but the first deadline is what two weeks away at most?</p>

				<p>RNA diseases have been produced in military bio labs since, ww1 due to the Zionist federal reserve banking system wanting a NWO of communist control. Ra in ancient egypt wanted control of his slaves too and he implemented depopulation. The triangles, pyramids, hieroglyphs and eye of horus  have brainwashing abilities over humans through the subconscious. Alchemy, freemasonry, cern, dna altering vaccines/bioweapons, bioelectromagnetics and neuro economics are controlled through federal Grant&#8217;s and use satanic symbolism. Therefore, hegelian dialect would have to say there is good in the bible. Revelations 2:9 3:9 &amp; 13:15-18. Keep in mind that the mark of the beast technology (rfid) has just arrived and the apocalypse was written about 2 thousand years ago. God and jesus are in charge and allowing satan to test us all to see if our soul goes to heaven or hell. Finally, I believe the abomination of desolation is changing man&#8217;s DNA (God&#8217;s building block) with rna. I could then understand why god would send plagues to earth as mutations, disease and suffering would be widespread.</p>
