		<h2 class="entry">Another Massive Russian Hack of US Government Networks</h2>
		<p>The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-treasury-exclsuive/exclusive-u-s-treasury-breached-by-hackers-backed-by-foreign-government-sources-idUSKBN28N0PG">press</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/us/politics/russian-hackers-us-government-treasury-commerce.html">is</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russian-government-spies-are-behind-a-broad-hacking-campaign-that-has-breached-us-agencies-and-a-top-cyber-firm/2020/12/13/d5a53b88-3d7d-11eb-9453-fc36ba051781_story.html">reporting</a> a massive hack of US government networks by sophisticated Russian hackers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Officials said a hunt was on to determine if other parts of the government had been affected by what looked to be one of the most sophisticated, and perhaps among the largest, attacks on federal systems in the past five years. Several said national security-related agencies were also targeted, though it was not clear whether the systems contained highly classified material.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The motive for the attack on the agency and the Treasury Department remains elusive, two people familiar with the matter said. One government official said it was too soon to tell how damaging the attacks were and how much material was lost, but according to several corporate officials, the attacks had been underway as early as this spring, meaning they continued undetected through months of the pandemic and the election season. </p></blockquote>
<p>The attack vector seems to be a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/14/solarwinds_fireeye_cozybear/">malicious update</a> in SolarWinds&#8217; &#8220;Orion&#8221; IT monitoring platform, which is widely used in the US government (<a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/company/customers">and elsewhere</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p>SolarWinds&#8217; comprehensive products and services are used by more than 300,000 customers worldwide, including military, Fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and education institutions. Our customer list includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 425 of the US Fortune 500
<li>All ten of the top ten US telecommunications companies
<li>All five branches of the US Military
<li>The US Pentagon, State Department, NASA, NSA, Postal Service, NOAA, Department of Justice, and the Office of the President of the United States
<li>All five of the top five US accounting firms
<li>Hundreds of universities and colleges worldwide</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sure more details will become public over the next several weeks.</p>

				<p>What&#8217;s really interesting is that no one is officially saying anything, and very few are saying anything unofficially.  Even on the various high sides no one is saying anything.</p>
<p>This is bad.  Seriously.  The US (and others, because if you think that only the US was hit then I&#8217;ve got a bridge to sell you) will probably be forced to respond strongly.</p>
<p>I wonder how Russia would cope with the sort of economic sanctions Iran has been dealing with?</p>

				<p>What the heck is Silverado Policy Accelerator. Supposedly a think tank as described on pbs news. How you you have ideology and security in the same unit. Are you security guys infected with the money men who like to fund think tanks and make truth disappear?</p>

				<p>I work for a defense contractor.  First question I was asking was how a hacker could get malicious code into a signed software update package.  Answer I received was that a Russian agent was unknowing employed by Solarwinds and that is where the ability came from.  Insider threats are the hardest to protect against.</p>

				<p>Such a malicious update could be made with any software(even free software) but I would like to point <a href="https://thwack.solarwinds.com/t5/Geek-Speak-Blogs/The-Pros-and-Cons-of-Open-source-Tools/ba-p/478665" rel="nofollow ugc">https://thwack.solarwinds.com/t5/Geek-Speak-Blogs/The-Pros-and-Cons-of-Open-source-Tools/ba-p/478665</a>, These people see opensource software like some cow they can milk.</p>

				<p>@ ALL,</p>
<p>First of can we stop calling it a &#8220;supply chain attack&#8221; because that can mean anything much like &#8220;Going on a trip&#8221; does.</p>
<p>What has happend at SolarWind is no less than one of the most serious things that can happen to a system based on cryptography (which code signing is). That is it is a successful Keying Material (KeyMat) attack which due to the nature of PK Certs used for signing is worse than that, as it&#8217;s also a successful KeyMat Generation (KeyGen) and KeyMat Managment (KeyMan) attack.</p>
<p>The purpose of which was to put a &#8220;covert backdoor&#8221; into around 1/3rd of a million Internet connrcted sites World Wide, not just in the US. With about 2/3rds effected, not just Government and Millitary sites but many major commercial sites. Thus the value of this attack is quite literally incalculable&#8230;</p>
<p>So the probability is not that it was a &#8220;rouge insider&#8221; attack, but something managment were aware of, as unless SolarWind is compleately screwed up in the development, test, tech support, and maintainence areas this should have raised all sorts of questions, that only a senior manager could keep under wraps.</p>
<p>So a question to ponder as this has &#8220;Global Scope&#8221; not just &#8220;US Scope&#8221; and would have needed the buy in of atleast one Senior Manager very much against the companies interests, who could do that&#8230;</p>
<p>The answer most likely on the technical side is, a US based entity possibly an IC or Federal LEO entity. We know this happens RSA, Jupiter Networks and others have been caught out. US based Federal entities can do it with little more than a National Security letter co-opting the SolarWind staff (something the DoJ/FBI tried with Apple, that ended up in a nasty court case the DoJ/FBI would have lost and got adverse case law, thus they bailed out on).</p>
<p>Now think what&#8217;s required for even a covert insider to do&#8230; Then an outside entity&#8230; Yup you will realise that the simplest technical explanation is it was an inside process from a senior manager in SolarWind. Which leaves the human question of &#8220;Why?&#8221; or &#8220;On who&#8217;s behalf?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Can we narrow it down, well peobably even though there is very little to go on. For all people are saying this is not realy a sophisticated attack of the sort we have seen with an IC Entity. That is they cover their tracks way better than Federal LEO entities have ever done.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m guessing that whilst we might see silly indictments as political stunts, which might de a good way for the FBI/DoJ to cover it up. The real story if we ever get to hear it will be way more interesting.</p>
<p>Thus it might be evidence of a failed &#8220;LEO Backdoor&#8221; where the information about the backdoor &#8220;leaked out&#8221; and got exploited by others much to the potential embarrassment of those who keep telling people to &#8220;neerd harder&#8221; rather than accept the reality of a backdoor is it alows both ingress and egress from who ever knows about it&#8230;</p>
<p>Before anyone asks, this is a hypothesis based on scant information and the application of William of Ockham&#8217;s notion[1], we now call Occham&#8217;s Razor. At the moment the little we know about the technical asspects of this attack are that those involved appear to be trying to keep them obscure or covered up for reasons currently unknown.</p>
<p>[1] Alledgedly he was born a few miles doen the road from me a few centuries ago when lifes choices for those not born into the land owning classes, was labour on the land, soldier craftmanship, priest. With life expectancy being about in that order as well.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  So the probability is not that it was a “rouge insider” attack, but something managment were aware of, as unless SolarWind is compleately screwed up in the development, test, tech support, and maintainence areas this should have raised all sorts of questions, that only a senior manager could keep under wraps.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a wealth of management incompetence in a <em>lot</em> of US companies, and that usually extends in spades to the hiring of technical staff, assuming they just don&#8217;t outsource much of their development work.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Thus it might be evidence of a failed “LEO Backdoor”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d agree that&#8217;s a reasonable speculation.  It could also highlight just how toxic the philosophy of backdoors is.  That is to say, once there is an acceptance of the <em>culture</em> that allows backdoors, people who might otherwise be security conscious might just ignore the one placed by a &#8220;rouge insider&#8221; if it&#8217;s just another one that got added to a pile of approved backdoors.</p>

				<p>Microsoft now has sinkholed the C2 domain.</p>
<p>And tomorrow, they are rolling out an update to Defender that will quarantine the executables from SolarWinds.</p>
<p>So, it just a matter of time for orgs to discover that they are using SolarWinds software after those that knew have long left the scene.</p>
<p>And then, they have to rebuild on the assumption that everything has been compromised.</p>

				<p>There&#8217;s always much ambiguity when one has to admit to being snookered. We have great freedom of innovation with respect to a variety of ways of implementing applications, etc. I worry, so many ways of innovating. While I wouldn&#8217;t stifle a free market answer, we might need to weigh in on also believing a market heresy is innovative when we circumscribe a security understanding. Risking opposition to so many damned ways of doing anything. It slips through, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

				<p>@ Clive</p>
<p>Interesting observation from a SolarWinds user.</p>
<p>Multiple instances, not all backdoored <em>per known hashes</em>.<br />
But, all kept up-to-date.</p>
<p>Hmmm.  Can the backdoor recreate itself as a clean version after doing it&#8217;s recon?</p>
<p>Maybe, it becomes decided that the target is low hanging fruit, so just disappears.</p>
<p>But, if not low hanging fruit, perhaps establishing persistence in some other way, and then disappears?</p>
<p>If so, I would no longer even trust the hardware.</p>

				<p>@ Clive, ALL</p>
<p>Oppsie.  Silver Lake rings many bells.</p>
<p>They must have connected the dots when FireEye said they were hacked on December 7.  Solarwinds knew they had the backdoor in place at FireEye.<br />
SolarWinds knew that FireEye would find them.<br />
SolarWinds knew the gig was up.</p>
<p>hXXps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/15/solarwinds-russia-breach-stock-trades/</p>
<p>Silver Lake, a Silicon Valley investor with a history of high-profile tech deals including Airbnb, Dell and Twitter, sold $158 million in shares of SolarWinds on Dec. 7 — six days before news of the breach became public. Thoma Bravo, a San Francisco-based private equity firm, also sold $128 million of its shares in SolarWinds on Dec. 7.</p>
<p>Together, the two investment firms own 70 percent of SolarWinds and control six of the company’s board seats, giving the firms access to key information and making their stock trades subject to federal rules around financial disclosures.</p>
<p>Three executives from Thoma Bravo are directors on the SolarWinds board: Seth Boro, James Lines and Michael Hoffman. Three executives from Silver Lake — Kenneth Hao, Michael Bingle and Mike Widmann — are also on the board.</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<p>That &#8220;new view&#8221; meme, reminds me of a cartoon in Private Eye many many years ago.</p>
<p>To get it though you need to know that &#8220;HMS Hermes&#8221; was a UK Navy &#8220;carrier&#8221;[1].</p>
<p>Also at the time there was what was considered a STD (now STI) Pandemic[2]. Back then people with the disease were refered to as &#8220;carriers&#8221;.</p>
<p>The cartoon was of a &#8220;Navy Day&#8221; dockside in front of an aircraft carrier and a slightly seedy/scruffy sailor was &#8220;propositioning&#8221; a young lady in a short tight dress.</p>
<p>She had a look of distaste on her face and on his cap band you could read &#8220;HMS Herpes&#8221;.</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<blockquote><p>Microsoft now has sinkholed the C2 domain.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>As I understand it from the Volexity report, &#8220;Dark Halo&#8221; had been buying numerous old domains up to help avoid detection. Also that &#8220;Dark Halo&#8221; also only used the domains just once for C2 activities.</p>
<p>Thus Microsoft may be &#8220;shutting the paddock gate&#8221; to the sound of distant hoof beats on that one, when the entire &#8220;string&#8221; has bolted&#8230;</p>
<p>With regards,</p>
<blockquote><p>But, if not low hanging fruit, perhaps establishing persistence in some other way, and then disappears?</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve not seen enough information to say.</p>
<p>However the Volexity report does talk about &#8220;Dark Halo&#8221; not just cleaning up after establishing alternative access, but having a lot of stuff in RAM which disapears after a server reset / power cycle. So in this case it could be that &#8220;no evidence of hack&#8221; is in reality &#8220;Evidence of probable ownership&#8221; of your system by Dark Halo&#8230;</p>
<p>With regards the &#8220;insider trading&#8221; by selling shares, I&#8217;m not surprised, and as long as the SEC &#8220;sits on it&#8217;s thumbs&#8221; such sell offs prior to security breach publication are just going to get both more blatent as well as more numerous&#8230;</p>

				<p>@ JimBob,</p>
<p>Whilst your statment is true&#8230;</p>
<p>The atribution to Russia you give befor may not be&#8230;</p>
<p>The supposed link to CosyBear apt28/29 etc, is not currently supported by either FireEye or Volexity, who call the attackers &#8220;UNC2452&#8221; and &#8220;Dark Halo&#8221; respectively. And say that they are unknown not just in attack style but who they work for or where they work from&#8230;</p>
<p>Hopefully time will reveal a little more publicly but it might not be for years (remember Stuxnet, and after years the admission that the target had realy been North Korea?).</p>

<p>The primary domain is interesting, as it first appears long before the Spring 2020 timeframe when SUNBURST is believed to have started (Spring 2020), in July 2018. A closer view of Whois history via DomainTools Iris shows a noticeable change in the domain in late 2019:</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p><code>The domain shifted to GoDaddy parking infrastructure on 20 December 2019, roughly the same time as the change in registration.</p>
<p>The domain remains on GoDaddy parking infrastructure until 27 February 2020, when it shifts to Microsoft cloud hosting (52.171.135[.]15, then 13.65.251[.]83)</p>
<p>At the same time hosting shifts to Microsoft, the domain changes authoritative name server to self-hosting at Avsvmcloud[.]com.<br />

<p>hXXps://twitter.com/FireEye/status/1339296101992685568</p>
<p>As part of our analysis of SUNBURST, we identified a killswitch that would prevent SUNBURST from continuing to operate.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>This killswitch will not remove the actor from victim networks where they have established other backdoors.</p>

				<p>Appears that main development and build system of SolarWinds software is in Brno, Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Someone was very, very familiar with the source code and had control of their SCM.</p>
<p>Either SolarWinds had been owned for sometime, or it was an inside job.</p>
<p>hXXps://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/sunburst-the-next-level-of-stealth</p>
<p>Here is stuff that maybe points to inside job.<br />
The backdoor would check if it was on internal networks and not run.  The domain names were known, but hashed in the backdoor code.</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<blockquote><p>Either SolarWinds had been owned for sometime, or it was an inside job.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reading through the Reversing Labs blog article you find,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Such string obfuscation is repeated throughout the code. And that’s the balance between standing out in a software developer review and fooling the security systems, <b>a gamble that has paid off for the attackers</b>.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>The attackers have taken quite a lot of involved steps to remain covert in other places, so &#8220;Why take a gamble?&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Especially when they appear to also have near unlimited access to the sourcecode, to watch authorised changes by SolarWinds staff in near real time&#8230;</p>
<p>Which brings me back to the point that it&#8217;s an insider, to the company at a sufficiently high level that &#8220;gambles&#8221; are not necessary, they can be &#8220;talked around&#8221;.</p>
<p>I guess the next stage for a SolarWinds internal investigation is to see who put the changes in the source control system and when, though how reliable that might be is another question.</p>
<p>It brings up shades of the way Ed Snowden collected his trove by using other peoples accounts/credentials.</p>
<p>When you look down the megabets thread you come across Jim Sykora&#8217;s tweet,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t the best ways to gain this detailed internal info be a) prolonged undetected access to SolarWinds internal networks to learn this or b) paying/subverting a SW employee?&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Did not expand the implications of his point and walk up the managment ladder a bit&#8230;</p>
<p>Look at it this way, if the company is doing things even half way sensibly, their ICTsec team would be looking for unusual activities on the internal networks. This would involve instrumenting the internal networks. So an external attacker going into the network blind is likely to hit an Intrusion Detection System they can not see as they enumerate the network. However a low level insider not in the ICTsec department would have only a limited knowledge of the network thus would probably bump an IDS as well. However someone who managed the development teams would have a much wider scope and would probably be aware of both the development and test networks as well as any IDS systems as the teams underneath them would trip them from time to time&#8230;</p>
<p>Either the attackers got very very lucky or they had eyes inside at a sufficiently high level. As the old saying goes,</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe in luck, and I create as much of it as I can&#8221;.</p>
<p>This sort of luck is not &#8220;blind luck&#8221; but has better than 20-20 vision, and they are not &#8220;counting cards&#8221; but &#8220;dealing them off the bottom&#8221;. The only question is how they know what&#8217;s on the bottom of the deck out os sight and supposadly unguessable&#8230;</p>

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing, SpaceLifeForm, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>This operation is so deep it reminds me of the story about The Trust </p></blockquote>
<p>The problem with &#8220;The Trust&#8221; was that it was more smoke and mirrors than reality.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if you saw any of the original three Harry Palmer films, but one &#8220;The Billion Dollar Brain&#8221; was a fascinating example of art imitating life, but years before life happened. In a way it was Science Fiction rather than a tale of espionage.</p>
<p>But in a way The Trust was an early example, of plots within plots, intrigue layered on intrigue, with no actor knowing what part they were playing nor on who&#8217;s side they were on officially or not, nor importantly what the outcome or their destiny would be.</p>
<p>From this respect SolarWinds is definately shaping up to be atleast a couple of bowls of popcorn entertainment. Now all we need is a crackling fire and a good bottle of whisky to help it all along on these cold windy nights 😉</p>

				<p>OpSec, other backdoors.</p>
<p>All of the hardware is un-trustable, even if it never had any SolarWinds software on it.  If on the LAN, even I would not trust a desktop that was on that LAN if there was any possible lateral or hopscotch movement from a SolarWinds server machine.</p>
<p>hXXps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>CISA is aware of compromises, which began at least as early as March 2020, at U.S. government agencies, critical infrastructure entities, and private sector organizations by an APT actor. This threat actor has demonstrated sophistication and complex tradecraft in these intrusions. <b>CISA expects that removing the threat actor from compromised environments will be highly complex and challenging</b>. This adversary has demonstrated an ability to exploit software supply chains and shown significant knowledge of Windows networks. <b>It is likely that the adversary has additional initial access vectors and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that have not yet been discovered</b>.</p>
<p>[Skiping SAML and impossible logins]</p>
<p>Operational Security</p>
<p>Due to the nature of this pattern of adversary activity—and the targeting of key personnel, incident response staff, and IT email accounts—discussion of findings and mitigations should be considered very sensitive, and should be protected by operational security measures. An operational security plan needs to be developed and socialized, via <b>out-of-band communications</b>, to ensure all staff are aware of the applicable handling caveats.</p>

				<p>@ Clive, JonKnowsNothing, ALL</p>
<p>Parse carefully what I <b>bolded</b> above.</p>
<p>What CISA is telling you is that you can not trust any existing Internet Protocol for commumnications.</p>
<p>You do know who this APT/TLA is, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You better figure it out if you do not know.</p>

<p>One more point if needed.</p>
<p>If your org finds IOC, yes, contact FBI and/or CISA.</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned in the past &#8220;air gapping is not enough&#8221;&#8230; Energy carries the message in many forms both conducted and radiated channels.</p>
<p>Which makes life fun for some, after all it&#8217;s not as though we have not been warning people here for more than a decade&#8230;</p>

<p>So, he wants to believe that if there are no identified problems, all is fine.</p>
<p>Maybe everything is still functioning as expected.  At this time.</p>
<p>But, it is dumb on his part to believe that there will not be future problems considering the amount of time for exfiltration.</p>
<p>Maybe he is only worried about the stock price.</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8216;&#8230; a Microsoft spokesperson said, adding that the company had found “no indications that our systems were used to attack others.”&#8230;&#8217;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>That is a curious statment at best, saying more by what it does not say than it does in words due to it&#8217;s ambiguity.</p>
<p>Let us assume in Microsoft&#8217;s case it was an &#8220;outsider attack&#8221;. To do the same sort of attack alledged against SolarWinds an initial four step approach is needed,</p>
<p>1, Gain entry undiscovered.<br />
2, Enumerate systems without tripping IDSs and the like.<br />
3, Gain access to development systems.<br />
4, Gain access to source code.</p>
<p>Once they have the source code they can start to work on it in various ways and gain intel that is not available from compiled code.</p>
<p>For instance variable names give insight as to how the programmer views their use, as do method names etc. But it also helps build a view of the direction the code is taking and which parts for what ever reason have received little attention. Also the career trajectory of programers and what their expertise may be.</p>
<p>And a lot more besides, look on it as &#8220;traffic analysis&#8221; of &#8220;code development&#8221; in the right hands such knowledge would be highly profitable in many ways most of us would not realise unless we spent some time &#8220;thinking hinky&#8221; as @Bruce might put it.</p>
<p>This is the sort of analysis I would expect from the upper end of Level III attackers such as the UK GCHQ and US NSA, and many Western European nations SigInt agencies. Such analysis is like the interest on an investment, it starts small and grows large depending on the quality of the investment.</p>
<p>So just having had access to Microsoft&#8217;s source code will have caused some harm to Microsoft&#8217;s customers down the line.</p>
<p>I could go on down the corruption of the developer chain showing many other potential &#8220;harms in waiting&#8221; that the Microsoft comment does not cover, and none of them are good.</p>
<p>However if I do, each step gets closer to becoming a DIY Guide[1] for attackere, and I&#8217;ve been told off for that in the past. So I&#8217;ll let others have their own thoughts on that.</p>
<p>[1] For those that want to know my early thinking on why code signing is such a bad idea, have a look on this blog pre-stuxnet by a few years. @Nick P, myself and one or two others had several conversations on the matter and pointed out a number of attack vectors some of which later appeared in Stuxnet a decade ago.</p>
