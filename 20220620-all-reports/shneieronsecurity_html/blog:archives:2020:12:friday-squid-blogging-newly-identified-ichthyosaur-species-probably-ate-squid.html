<p>  &#8230; This is the second time a Zodiac cipher has been cracked. The first, one long cipher sent in pieces to The Chronicle, San Francisco Examiner and Vallejo Times-Herald newspapers in 1969, was solved by a Salinas schoolteacher and his wife.</p>
<p>  Known as the 408 Cipher, it said little beyond: “I like killing because it is so much fun.” &#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Something isn&#8217;t fair or somebody isn&#8217;t playing by the rules, because the mainstream media simply haven&#8217;t been coming clean with their own involvement in jounalistic hatchet jobs, what they know of serial killings, or what price they are offering on whose head as murder-for-hire.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m calling Oscillococcinum® on the schoolteacher story of the 1969 &#8212; it&#8217;s all a hippie haze of marijuana smoke and somebody&#8217;s got a head cold and some other cure for what ails them, because that is roughly when doctors started lopping off limbs of U.S. citizens on the orders of the Vietcong, and now Iran is paying even more to continue such brutal practices of judicially ordered amputations in the U.S.</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<p>If I read this correctly,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;By luck, we discovered that (Zodiac) split it into three pieces and rearranged the message in a predictable diagonal pattern in the first two pieces.” &#8220;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s, firstly &#8220;Russian coupling&#8221; followed by secondly a &#8220;routing cipher&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which makes it sound simple which it is to encrypt, but even with computer assistance takes a long long time and can be quite daunting to perform cryptanalysis on unless the method is known.</p>
<p>You can make a cryptographers life a further missery by using a grille and nulls and make the routes cross over each other and do things like share vowels thus changing message statistics.</p>
<p>The reason you can do the latter steps is because these are &#8220;show piece ciphers&#8221; thus each encryption method can be unique to the message. So a cryptanalysist does not have &#8220;messages in depth&#8221; to provide method statistics over and above message content statistics for them to work on. You can also make such systems have two or more solutions thus alowing you to claim guilt or innocence as you chose or throw confusion into a situation.</p>
<p>So think of the message almost as a type of &#8220;hash&#8221; that the criminal can prove who they are but the investigators and their cryptographers can not reverse or do so easily.</p>
<p>[1] Russian Coupling is a &#8220;term of art&#8221; that appears to have gone out of fashion (as has Museum Search). It was a method first used to hide &#8220;message indicators&#8221; or other structure or common usage (think HH or Heil Hitler salutation in enigma messages). It was for some reason lost to history associated whith Russian &#8220;Nihilist&#8221; anti-tsarist movment from the late 19th century and it&#8217;s a quite simple process. In essence all you do is split a message into parts and swap them around in a prearanged order. Thus stylistic message parts move from the begining and end of the text into the middle. Such splitting can be done befor or after encipherment. In the case of hiding message indicators after message encipherment, but could be before or after &#8220;super encryption&#8221;. For what is a simple manual process it could throw up quite a road block to cryptanalysis.</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s a long time since I&#8217;ve written anything about the pandemic &#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html" rel="nofollow ugc">article from New York magazine</a> which I found surprising, sad, and hopeful.</p>
<p>The outstanding surprise for me is that Moderna completed the design of its mRNA-1273 vaccine on 13 January, just two days after a laboratory in China published the SARS-CoV-2 genome.</p>
<p>By the time the first U.S. death from Covid-19 was reported, Moderna had already manufactured this vaccine and shipped samples to the NIH for the start of safety testing.</p>
<p>The pandemic death toll in the U.S. has now surpassed the loss of American lives in the second World War.</p>
<p>Note well that Moderna&#8217;s achievement is not <em>quite</em> as magical as it seems; it built upon substantial research and lab work based on the first SARS outbreak in 2003.</p>
<p>Although Covid-19 vaccine development has surpassed all speed records, the vaccines will be too late (given the criminal negligence of U.S. governance) for nearly half a million Americans, and of course much larger numbers in other countries who will have died before vaccination is widespread.</p>
<p>An especially bitter irony is that in the U.S. &#8212; and probably several other countries whose cruel regimes adopted the &#8220;let &#8217;em die&#8221; policy &#8212; the populations might already reach infection-acquired herd immunity before the vaccination programs can be completed.</p>
<p>Should, or could, vaccines have been applied sooner?  Those who&#8217;ve thought the problem through will know that a release without sufficient testing would likely harm public health in multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<blockquote><p>the scientists [the author] spoke to for this story &#8230; all said they expected the vaccines were safe and effective all along. Which has made a number of them wonder whether, in the future, at least, we might find a way to do things differently</p></blockquote>
<p>========================</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where the hopeful part comes in.  Epidemiologists have been studying pandemic risk for a long time, and believe it &#8220;extremely likely&#8221; that future pandemic strains will be closely related to one of a pool of about 50 to 100 known viruses.</p>
<p>Some scientists propose that it&#8217;s entirely feasible to develop vaccines for every one of them, and to carry out the first stages of testing (including animal trials and Phase I safety testing) in advance.</p>
<p>In fact, Phase II and even part of Phase III could even be included in this preparatory work.  Having these vaccines and tests &#8220;in the bank&#8221; could reduce deployment time from 11 months (the new &#8220;world record&#8221;) to perhaps 3 months, with enormous benefits.</p>
<p>The cost of such proactive research could be as little as USD 3 billion, much less than one percent of what Covid-19 is costing.</p>
<p>However, politics being what it is, the experts interviewed for the article weren&#8217;t optimistic that this wise investment will be made.</p>

&#8220;However, politics being what it is, the experts interviewed for the article weren’t optimistic that this wise investment will be made.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that these experts have a very realistic view of society.</p>
<p>Over here, all doctors (MDs) are eager to get vaccinated. However, only 1/3rd of the nurses are sure they will take the vaccine.</p>
<p>Natural Selection in action.</p>

				<p>Why Content Security Policy (CSP) header not implemented for this site? I also notice no SRI(clicking on the social media toggle would load things I suppose), is this due to Unfeasability(I can set javascript src to none because my website has no scripts. And Doesn&#8217;t WordPress increase the attack surface?( comments would still need a backend though) Why doesn&#8217;t a static site would work?</p>

<p>You said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Over here, all doctors (MDs) are eager to get vaccinated. However, only 1/3rd of the nurses are sure they will take the vaccine.
</p></blockquote>
<p>My wife&#8217;s son is an actual ICU pulmonary doctor here in the US, who finished near the top of his Med School class and got his first-choice residency a handful of years ago. He wears a cloth mask over his N95 mask, as well as all the other kit his job requires.</p>
<p>He said that he would prefer to wait a bit because this vaccine technology is so bleeding-edge new, but that he may have no choice as hospital staff. He definitely wants to get vaccinated, but he simply finds it prudent to wait for more data to come out about safety and side effects and efficacy and whatnot.</p>
<p>Note that the Pfizer vaccine did have four people develop Bell&#8217;s Palsy (partial facial paralysis).</p>
<p>Life has a lot of risk/reward situations. Regardless of how outstanding this new vax tech is, we should all be wearing masks and social distancing for quite a while still.</p>
<p>As well, if the vaccines don&#8217;t prevent viral shedding (which is as yet unknown), it seems likely that it could actually result in more super-spreaders, seeing as how so many people are utterly selfish in their lack of consideration for others.</p>

The method has been tested before on Melanoma patients as it was initially developed for cancer immunotherapy.</p>
<p>I understand that there are side effects of the vaccine. However, people never seem to weight the side effects of taking the vaccine against the side effects of <em>not</em> taking the vaccine.</p>
<p>The side effects of <em>not</em> taking a vaccine have already killed 1.6 million people (for readers from the USA, 300,000 Americans died).</p>
<p>So, waiting 6 months for another type of vaccine increases your risk of getting COVID-19 and developing crippling symptoms or even dying.</p>

<p>Understood and agreed (and thanks), but the deadliness of other Coronaviruses is immaterial to the fact that we are attempting to create a vaccine for a class of virus we have never tried to do so for before, using a new class of technologies to do so.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not these new vaccines&#8217; efficacy versus safety is worth the risk, the important thing is that we all need to &#8212; for the foreseeable future &#8212; be wearing our masks and staying away from crowds, especially in indoor, poorly-ventilated spaces.</p>
<p>Personally, knowing that our natural resistance to the common cold (another Coronavirus) does not last very long, I am very curious to see if these vaccines confer a more permanent protection, or will they be short-lived too?</p>
<p>And, REMEMBER EVERYONE: Dr. Fauci takes 4000iu of Vitamin D daily, so get your sun or augment another way, especially in these winter months!</p>

&#8220;Coronaviruses have never been known to cause any big issues in the past, so it’s never been considered useful to put resources into vaccinating against coronavirus.&#8221;</p>
<p>SARS1 is a coronavirus. It killed over 700 people and caused a worldwide panic in 2002-2004. MERS is another coronavirus that proved to be rather deadly, but not infectious between humans.</p>
<p>Vaccine development for SARS 1 was fairly advanced when the epidemic petered out and all funds dried up.</p>
<p>The experience with SARS 1 and MERS were instrumental in both the strong reactions to COVID19 and the speed of detection and vaccine development.</p>

&#8220;“I Just Trust Them” is just as unscientific.&#8221;</p>
<p>You obviously did not look at the Xkcd link 🙂</p>
<p>But my advice to weight the risks of vaccination against the risks of not vaccination is a very basic and simple one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put another way, I consider it very foolish to blindly trust a for-profit corporation in any way&#8221;</p>
<p>Few CEOs will risk their freedom with cutting corners on vaccine safety. You can be pretty sure that anything going wrong with these vaccines will be put under a lot of microscopes. And any politician will be very happy to scapegoat the board of a big pharma company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until then, the only thing we know for sure is that masks and social distancing work at country-wide levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please do keep yourself healthy.</p>
<p>&#8220;COVID-19 appears to really only be a problem in countries with sufficient hordes of the selfishly ignorant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not following the news then. COVID19 is a problem almost everywhere. Only (semi-)islands seem to be able to contain it&#8217;s spread. And even they do not always succeed.</p>

				<p>To give further context vaccines usually take longer than a year and these diseases weren&#8217;t as widespread. There have been researches for sure but I was talking about mass vaccinations.</p>
<p>As an example polio had killed many fold to be a part of such mass vaccination campaigns&#8230; Probably shouldn&#8217;t have underplayed them(did misqoute somewhat)</p>

&#8220;But my advice to weight the risks of vaccination against the risks of not vaccination is a very basic and simple one.&#8221;</p>
<p>To make this somewhat more concrete.</p>
<p>In the next 6 months, 200,000-300,000 Americans are expected to die from COVID-19. That is more 1 in every 2000 Americans.</p>
<p>During the vaccine tests, tens of thousands of volunteers have received these vaccines. None have died. So your chances of dying from these vaccines seems to be below 1 in 10,000.</p>
<p>I know there are a myriad reasons why these risks are different for each individual. But on average, not taking the vaccine seems to be more risky for Americans than taking the vaccine.</p>

				<p>@Winter the biggest risk is not death in a month here. Vaccines can show side effects in a long period of six months or so, this has never been tested on any volunteer. Some of the vaccines are based on a completely new tech, heightening the risks of such accelerations, though we still may consider vaccination to be better than not after adding these weights</p>

				</p>

				<p>So, if such a side effect is to occur after six months we may see a serious effect on whole population(eg. Mental health issues), this isn&#8217;t something we can just reduce to probability percentages.</p>

<p>Quotes are yours:</p>

<p>Will you admit you are completely and utterly wrong?</p>
<p>Of course I read it.</p>
<p>And blind trust is no different than blind mistrust.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  But my advice to weight the risks of vaccination against the risks of not vaccination is a very basic and simple one.
</p></blockquote>
<p>My advice is based upon a top-notch ICU pulmonary internist.</p>
<p>Yours is based on you reading the news and &#8220;feeling&#8221; what you should do.</p>
<p>Whose advice would Dunning &amp; Kruger recommend?</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Few CEOs will risk their freedom with cutting corners on vaccine safety. You can be pretty sure that anything going wrong with these vaccines will be put under a lot of microscopes. And any politician will be very happy to scapegoat the board of a big pharma company.
</p></blockquote>
<p>How many CEOs have been imprisoned for the opioid epidemic? Precisely ZERO by my count (but I could be wrong).</p>
<p>You do not understand the concept of corporate liability limitation or the level of corruption in the US government. Neither do you understand goal-seeking in research or the effects MBAs have on medical science and its applications.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  COVID19 is a problem almost everywhere.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s a problem everywhere, but it&#8217;s a really, really big problem only in certain countries with certain policies, especially those that opened drinking establishments and those with a lot of ignorant mask-denying fools.</p>
<p>Now compare the countries of Southeast Asia with America, and tell me that the problem is anywhere near equal.</p>
<p>The reality is that our primary focus MUST be on public social policy because a) wide enough vaccine distribution is a LONG way off, and b) the vaccines may prove ineffective not only due to COVID-19&#8217;s various mutations that already exist, but in its mutability going forward.</p>
<p>My wife&#8217;s son intubates people with COVID-19 for his living. The only protection he can rely upon is his PPE and personal behaviors. That is the case with us all, for the foreseeable future, however short that is in late 2020.</p>
<p>And we would all be wise to listen to the experts, not to laypeople with &#8220;feelings&#8221;.</p>

				<blockquote><p>“COVID-19 appears to really only be a problem in countries with sufficient hordes of the selfishly ignorant.”</p>

<p>Yes, and a lot of the outbreaks can be traced to selfishly ignorant behavior: anti-mask rallies, religious gatherings, eating meals near family members one doesn&#8217;t live with. Do you have an example of an outbreak among &#8220;well-behaved&#8221; people? I don&#8217;t recall seeing one, although isolated cases pop up. Even on those crazy post-June cruises, most infections were among the staff (who cannot maintain proper distance from each other).</p>
<p>If one doesn&#8217;t work a &#8220;front line&#8221; job, it seems entirely reasonable to decide to keep wearing a mask and to avoid close contact with anyone till the vaccines have gotten more testing. Masks alone reduce risk by about 70% (when everyone wears them), and there seems to be little risk of catching the virus without close contact (e.g., one doesn&#8217;t catch it from quickly walking past someone in a store).</p>
<p>Deciding to skip the vaccine but resume normal activities, such as parties and dining out, is of course reckless at current transmission levels. Those who have legitimate medical advice to avoid the vaccines will have to wait till we have herd immunity or the virus otherwise stops spreading.</p>

				<p>@ MarkH,</p>
<blockquote><p>Should, or could, vaccines have been applied sooner? Those who’ve thought the problem through will know that a release without sufficient testing would likely harm public health in multiple dimensions.</p></blockquote>
<p>We actualy have no idea about the long term effects of these mRNA vaccines will have. That could take twenty or thirty years to find out. The mRNA system has never made it out of the lab before and unlike most other vaccines it is an entirely novel to humans technique. So I for one will not have it stuck in my arm.</p>
<p>Other traditional vaccines whilst each is in effect new the methods are well known and nearly all the likely side effects are known[1] from long experience, which is why the risks are known to be actually very low of this type of vaccines both short term and longterm, unlike the highly profitable mRNA products with all their major difficulties.</p>
<p>And before some &#8220;mouthpiece&#8221; accuses me of being &#8220;anti-vax&#8221; far from it, I will be as far up the que as they will let me get when the Oxford vaccine becomes available, and it has nothing to do with the fact it&#8217;s &#8220;British&#8221; and everything to do with risk both short and long term, and also because those mRNA vaccines are not going to work outside of a first world hospital seting with a dedicated area for cryogenics and very experienced staff.</p>
<p>[1] CNN&#8217;s almost hysterical inaccurate to the point of ignoring well known facts reporting was bad. So much so as to make the story effectively Fake News is not good. What happened was two UK hospital workers with known severe allergies sufficiently bad they had to carry &#8220;eppi-pens&#8221; at all times in case of Anaphylactic shock elected to have the vaccine. Where they were vaccinated (not CNN saying innoculated) was well prepared for this as it&#8217;s a well known problem with not just vaccines but many other things that are injected, or breathed in or ingested, hence the eppi-pens people have carried for decades. One can only assume CNN are extreamly ignorant, being malicious for fiscal or other reasons or both.</p>

&#8220;Of course I read it. And blind trust is no different than blind mistrust.&#8221;</p>
<p>I blindly mistrust anything that has been developed by a bat. And every bat expert will tell the same.</p>
<p>@Terry @rrd<br />
&#8220;Yes, and a lot of the outbreaks can be traced to selfishly ignorant behavior: anti-mask rallies, religious gatherings, eating meals near family members one doesn’t live with. &#8221;</p>
<p>My point was that such people are everywhere. It is part of the human condition. The alternative is not dealing with humans or state enforcement.</p>
<p>@rrd<br />

<p>Here we agree. Although I think the mutability of COVID-19 is overestimated in the press. Still, it could be correct.</p>
<p>My point remains: Not taking the vaccine has its own, considerable risks.</p>

<p>RNA vaccines have been tested in melanoma patients who were followed for 2 years. They did not develop any strange symptoms.</p>
<p>RNA transfection has been studied since the 1980s. The RNA has a short half life in the body. That is why it is useful as a vaccine.</p>

  Still, experts who have watched influenza and HIV mutate over years, evading vaccines, warn that future mutations of SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown. And the best shot at avoiding changes that make the virus impervious to a vaccine remains curtailing its spread and reducing the opportunities it has to mutate.</p>
<p>  “If the virus changes substantially, particularly the spike proteins, then it might escape a vaccine. We want to slow transmission globally to slow the clock,” said Deakin’s Bennett. “That reduces the chances of a one in a squillion change that’s awful news for us.”

&#8221; warn that future mutations of SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown. &#8221;</p>
<p>It is difficult to make predictions, particularly about the future.</p>
<p>The advice is sound, but not to distract from actually vaccinating the population</p>

				<p>@rrd @Winter @Clive @All</p>
<p>re: <i> COVID-19 mutations </i></p>
<p>There are a good number of mutations documented.  Majority of mutations arise and go extinct spontaneously and the same mutations can appear independently in different locals.<br />
eg: A mutation in Country A can come and go and the same mutation in Country B can arise at a different time with no connection to the version in Country A.</p>
<p>There are a number of existing mutations floating around that provide &#8220;antibody escape&#8221; mechanisms in different parts of the COVID-19 genetic layout.<br />
eg: all those curly ribbons and dots and arrows in diagrams.</p>
<p>The main focus of current vaccines has been to target the spike protein because that&#8217;s what is common in all existing forms of the COVID-19 virus globally.  Only one mutation has been seen in that structure Mink-COVID19.</p>
<p>Mink-COVID19 (human to mink, mink to mink, mink to human chain) is in theory extinct now from the mass culling of mink.  However, not every country has culled their mink farms or restricted mink farming. This is pelting season so most minks will be killed now anyway.  The breeding stock and future mink farms are the area of concern (not including PETA here).  The mutation change F-spike ΔFVI-spike showed &#8220;less response to antibody tests&#8221; in the lab. As the vaccines target increasing antibody responses, have a &#8220;less response&#8221; was enough to order the mass culls.</p>
<p>Countries that later confirmed Y453F F-spikes are:<br />
  * Denmark 329<br />
  * Netherlands 6<br />
  * South Africa 2<br />
  * Switzerland 2<br />
  * Faroe Islands 1<br />
  * Russia 1<br />
  * USA Utah 2</p>
<p>We know that COVID-19 has a short shelf life and in countries that can provide adequate quarantine the cases of Y453F mutation, that iteration of mutations should have died out.</p>
<p>The cramped close proximity no mask conditions of crowded caged mink farming was an ideal incubator for mutation shifting. Given the same conditions in the USA and other Herd Immunity Policy (let em die) countries, more mutations will happen.</p>
<p>There is a hope of making crap-tons of money quickly before the next mutation happens.</p>
<p>In the USA<br />
&emsp; * in Wave 1a you got COVID-19 from strangers<br />
&emsp; * in Wave 1b you got COVID-19 from your family and closest friends<br />
&emsp; * in Wave 1c you will get COVID-19 and you won&#8217;t know why.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;You won&#8217;t be able to tell who is sick, who is vaccinated.</p>

				<p>Re vaccines:</p>
<p>Flu viruses and coronaviruses are quite distinct from one another.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, flu viruses have always shown rapid and fairly continuous mutation in ways that defeat the effectiveness of vaccines, so that design of flu vaccines is a perennial attempt to hit a moving target.</p>
<p>In general, coronaviruses are much more genetically stable, and so far the stability of the targeted spike proteins has been very high.</p>
<p>I hope that humanity&#8217;s luck will hold in this regard.</p>
<p>==========================</p>
<p>@Clive:</p>
<p>I certainly share your anxiety about the unknowns of such a novel vaccine.</p>
<p>By the time I have the opportunity to get one (which will probably be the Moderna), there will a very large population already vaccinated.</p>
<p>As far as I know, vaccine side-effects show promptly, or not at all.</p>
<p>I consider two factors:</p>
<p>First, the people who design and develop these things have quite a lot of insight into how they function, and care about their future health and that of their friends and families.</p>
<p>Second, I have some duty to others to help protect them from the propagation of this plague.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I&#8217;m planning to take the shots.</p>

				<p>PS</p>
<p>For completeness, I add that coronaviruses are much more genetically stable than flu with respect to functional evolution.</p>
<p>They do accumulate many &#8220;copying errors&#8221; which help researchers to trace their spread, but rarely modify how they work, which raises the probability that Covid vaccines will work against current strains for a year or even several years.</p>

				<p>For most people, getting a vaccine won&#8217;t be in front of them until the spring, so, there is no reason to make any decision at this time.  Right now, I need to be focused on taxes, with a deadline of Dec 31st.</p>
<p>One thing I would mention is, the corporate media takes an awful lot of money from big pharma.  That could put a slant on the coverage. Aside from health care workers and long term care residents, the rest of us can take a deep breath, and figure out things later, when more information becomes available.</p>

				<p>@ Goat,</p>
<blockquote><p>Is free software destined to be under funded?</p></blockquote>
<p>That can not realy be answered for certain as times and circumstances change. But as much commercial software is underfunded currently, we can make the assumption that in this current climate it&#8217;s quite likely.</p>
<p>But we can makr a second more probable guess,</p>
<p>Is well written Free software going to be &#8220;Freeloaded by large commercial enyerprises to save R&amp;D costs?</p>
<p>Thr answer there is an almost certain yes.</p>
<p>Because,</p>
<p>1, Look where Mirosoft got their network code.</p>
<p>2, Look where Apple got the base for their Graphical Operating System base.</p>
<p>3, Look where many SaaS cloud servers that charge users quite large sums get their code from.</p>

				<p>One part of security is information hygiene and the suppression of lies and mistruths. There is only a single &#8220;truth&#8221; out there as it is, by definition, correct. Anyone who talks about &#8220;your truth&#8221; is lying, however there are varying degrees of accuracy.</p>
<p>When it comes to vaccines this is very important, I hold Andrew Wakefield personally responsible for thousands of unnecessary deaths from measles every year as a result of his fraudulent publication and everyone who peddles this misinformation is equally culpable. Worldwide in 2018 over 140,000 people died of measles[1] so please consider the implications of questioning the safety of vaccines based on hearsay and no evidence. Please apply Hitchens&#8217;s razor[2] whenever you hear unsupported statements.</p>
<p>We have a situation where about 10PPM of the entire US population is dying every day at the moment[3] and people are still acting in ways which spread the disease. It would be an interesting calculation to determine how many micromorts[4] result every day from a person not wearing a face-mask, going to a large event or publishing wild speculation or misinformation. It would also be interesting to consider what would be an appropriate punishment for killing 0.001 person by going to a political rally without your facemask. A face-mask isn&#8217;t guaranteed to protect people at an individual level but across an entire population they make a difference and even if you don&#8217;t think they are effective it is reasonable to err on the side of caution and wear one.</p>
<p>We know people are dying every day from Covid, it is <em>possible</em> that the very new mRNA vaccine may have some long term effects[5] but we know not using it will kill people so it is a sensible approach. There is no credible evidence at present of any risk from it, just lots of wild speculation which will end up killing people who don&#8217;t take the vaccine so please think before you write. Again Hitchens&#8217;s razor comes to mind.</p>
<p>If more than one type of vaccine is available then it would be reasonable to use the more established types if they are known to be safe and effective otherwise we simply use what we have got.</p>

				<p>@ AndyF,</p>
<blockquote><p>Please apply Hitchens’s razor[2] whenever you hear unsupported statements.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which from your source quote is,</p>
<p><i>&#8220;It says that the burden of proof regarding the truthfulness of a claim lies with the one who makes the claim; if this burden is not met, then the claim is unfounded, and its opponents need not argue further in order to dismiss it.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Let me see, how about what is being said about both the efficacy and safety of mRNA in the future?</p>
<p>The actual fact is we know nothing about mRNA in the long term or in large populations, because nobody has done the testing for self evident factual reasons.</p>
<p>So according to the use of Hitchens’s razor &#8220;this burden is not met&#8221; so &#8220;the claim is unfounded&#8221;, so there is no need to &#8220;argue further in order to dismiss it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So &#8216;Case dismised with prejudice due to self evident lack of factual reasons&#8217;.</p>
<p>Oh and stop trying to add FUD to your argument re Wakefield and measels that is just another variation on the &#8220;think of the children&#8221; emotional dog whistle.</p>
<p>That was a political punch up by the UK Government to deny parents the right to chose between the tripple and three seperate vaccines for nigerdly fiscal reasons and the then Prime Minister did not take his aithority being challenged well.</p>
<p>What few remember now is that the US safety insurance was asking several times the total of the three seperate jabs for the tripple. Why would they do that? After discussions with medical proffessionals we chose to pay the money to get the three seperate injections privately than the tripple for free.</p>
<p>Oh and do not make untruthful statments such as,</p>
<blockquote><p>it is possible that the very new mRNA vaccine may have some long term effects[5] <b>but we know not using it will kill people so it is a sensible approach</b>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The mRNA vacines are over priced and of unknown thus uncertain longterm safety they are also extreamly difficult to distribute reliably. But they are not the only vaccines there are a Chinese and Russian vaccines already in use though there is no evidence of independent efficacy or safety data (no phase III trials).</p>
<p>But the Oxford Astrazrnica is the only vaccine with peer reviewed and published Phase III trial data. It uses an adenovirus that has been used in other vaccines safely for many years thus is very much a known quantity. But more importantly it is loe cost and easily transported and is already ready to roll in very large quantaties. So there is a probably much safer less costly vaccine out there ready to run.</p>
<p>As I said I will not have the mRNA vaccine which is of not just unknown risk, it does not have any published peer reviewed data available. But as I have repeatedly made crystal clear I will have as soon as they offer it to me the Oxford vaccine.</p>
<p>My choice is not anti-vaccine as you imply but alternative vaccine that actually appears to be a better medical option.</p>
<p>But you should also note that modeling from a well known US university shows that at best all the vaccines will only save maybe 9000 lives in the US in the first quater next year probably less&#8230; Where as effective mask wearing will easily save seven times that number at upwards of 60,000 lives in the same time period.</p>
<p>So a better option than the mRNA vaccines would be, wear a mask properly (which you have to do with the mRNA vaccine for a similar period anyway) then in a month or so get a shot of the Oxford vacine.</p>
<p>As for those not getting vaccinated that is there choice to make and nothing to do with myself or others, we are not telling them to &#8220;not get vaccinated&#8221; we are saying get vaccinated but with another probably better vaccine.</p>

<p>I am all for the Oxford vaccine. It has lower efficacy, but is cheaper and much easier to handle. That vaccine can be used to eradicate COVID-19. The mRNA vaccines cannot.</p>
<p>However, the Oxford vaccine might only be available in half a year. Very, very many people will die of COVID in the time we are waiting. Many of these people could be saved using the mRNA vaccines.</p>
<p>And unknown long term effects are all pure speculation. If your argument is that totally new vaccines should only be given after they have been used for 10 years, you are looking for a logical impossibility.</p>
<p>Btw, prions are most definitely not RNA and their outbreak were the result of some utterly irresponsible neo-con deregulation in animal husbandry (you should never feed meat to a herbivore, cannibalism is the high road to disease). There is zero relation with vaccines. Also, I do not see what the connection is between auto immune diseases and RNA vaccines.</p>

<p>@Winter actually most vaccines take A LOT of time to be made.. Ten years isn&#8217;t excessive by the normal standard.</p>
<p>US allocation to vaccines may allow such extravagant spending but it definately isn&#8217;t feasible to get mrna vaccines in third world countries.</p>

				<p>@ Winter,</p>
<blockquote><p>I do not see what the connection is between auto immune diseases and RNA vaccines.</p></blockquote>
<p>Have you looked up how mRNA vaccines differ from traditional vaccines?</p>
<p>Over simplistically as I don&#8217;t want to be typing for ages, producong a great long posting that most will never read&#8230;</p>
<p>What happens with a traditional vaccine, is that what is injected into you is a harmless  very weakened or inactive non viable analog of some part of the lippid capsual that protects the actual pathogen. What the immune system does is it learns to recognise some aspect of that lippid capsual analog fairly safely. So if and when the real pathogen comes along your immune system thinks it&#8217;s the same and is prepared for it and leeps almost immediately into action. As the analog is effectively harmless and does not replicate, it&#8217;s something your body is used to responding to and most importantly <b>cleaning up in a decay by time process.</b></p>
<p>The mRNA process is different it is designed to replicate in your body&#8230; That is your body makes the target protein by the same process a virus replicates. This in effect means simplistically it&#8217;s the equivalent of an RNA virus but lacks the parts required to make it viable as an infective agent. That is it actually gets into your bodies cells and co-opts their protien production functioning in the same way an RNA virus does or the mRNA made from a copy of your cells DNA does.</p>
<p>The difference is the protiens the mRNA of the vaccine encodes for, are those in the head of the spike of the actual pathogen thus it&#8217;s the cells in your body that make the analog that triggers your bodies immune defences. Thus importantly <b>it does not decay with time but will increase with time untill your immune system brings it down, if it ever can&#8230;</b></p>
<p>The bodies response to disease is both complex and has openended positive feedback systems. When the process does not work well for some reason that&#8217;s where an infection response becomes an autoimmune disease response and put simply those kill people which is undesirable. As with cytokine storms we do not yet know what mechanisms in peoples genetic makeup that trigger autoimmune disease responses like the one for Type II diabetes that takes ten or more years to become evident by which time an organ in your body is effectively destroyed and if you do not replicate the organs function you die unpleasently and often slowely.</p>
<p>There are other issues with mRNA protien replication. You can get a resulting protien that chemically looks the same but folds up differently. That is effectively what prion disease is all about, and it kills people. It&#8217;s mostly seen in the nerve tissues as &#8220;spongiform holes&#8221; or &#8220;amyloid&#8221; fiber/cluster disfunction. The former is associated with &#8220;scrapie&#8221; and &#8220;mad cow disease&#8221; and the varient &#8220;CJD&#8221;. The latter is seen in dementia both can take twenty or thirty years to become apparent. Again we know next to nothing about the processes other than mRNA protien replication disfunction is involved in both.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now something like a third of a century or half an adult life time for the mRNA process the vaccine uses to &#8220;sort-of&#8221; be got working. Realistically we don&#8217;t know why it works or what the risks are as it never realy got out of the lab as it mainly failed to work or had undesirable issues.</p>
<p>Go look these things up yourself and read through them but they all have a common chatecteristic &#8220;we know a good deal less than is desirable&#8221; and in the case of these two mRNA vaccines we know very little indeed because there has been no peer-reviewed information published just marketing and market blurb.</p>
<p>Then ask yourself if pushing something we know so little about into hundreds of millions of arms not once but twice and potentialy again annually is realy a good idea? If every arm in the US gets it and ten years down the road 0.1% of them start getting an organ failure or nurelogical degeneration the US healthcare system will not be able to cope with that sort of increase&#8230;</p>
<p>To me as a design engineer in a number of fields, it just appears daft to make an experiment of 1/3rd of a billion people with so many unknowns, especially when there are way way lower risk well known alternatives.</p>
<p>But as I keep pointing out it&#8217;s your choice. If I was say 80years old then the weighting of the risks would be significantly different and I might go for one of the mRNA vaccines. But I&#8217;m a good deal less than eighty and with care might have another third of a century to live in moderate to good health. Thus I&#8217;m personally not going to go down the mRNA route, not just for this pandemic vaccine but for most things that will not kill me or will kill me slowely, the lower risk options for me are better as they would be for anyone in moderate to good health and sixty or less old. Why because the COVID death risk as far as we can tell is &#8220;exponential with age&#8221; thus for more than half your life the COVID risk is comparatively low and actually falling with improved health care techniques. But the risk rises in you sixties rather more so in your seventies and fairly significant in your eighties.</p>
<p>But also lifestyle issues significantly change your risk as well, more so than the mRNA vaccines will anytime soon. As I&#8217;ve indicated various US uni models predict nearly seven times the risk reduction from just wearing a mask than having a vaccine shoved in your arm for the first quater of 2021 other techniques such as washing hands, having good ventilation maintaing good seperation further etc reduces the risk further.</p>
<p>These are things people should be being told which obviously they are not.</p>

<blockquote><p>No attention is being paid to the ongoing environmental degradation that would inevitably lead to many more pandemics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not so much attention <em>here</em>, &#8217;tis true &#8230;</p>
<p>But ecologists, and health scientists who study the <em>origin</em> of zoonotic epidemics, are painfully aware of this matter.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental confusions leading to so many preventable Covid deaths is that preventing pandemic transmission and economic prosperity are mutually exclusive.  Many economists have been trying to tell the world, &#8220;if you want your economies to be strong, protect people from this plague.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same relationship holds between preservation/repair of humanity&#8217;s natural heritage, and economic prosperity.  They are falsely said to be in opposition (by people on <em>one side</em> of the ideological spectrum).  The latter cannot exist without the former.</p>
<p>Those driven by greed are resistant to such truth.</p>

<blockquote><p>No attention is being paid to the ongoing enviromental degradation that would inevitably lead to many more pandemics.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the degradation it&#8217;s the deliberate driving of people into &#8220;virgin areas&#8221; where all sorts of nasties lurk and zoonotic where new infection creation is most probable.</p>
<p>But there is another area that concernces my rather more in the short term. Which is SARS-CoV-2 varients forming disease reservoirs in various places. Where like ebola and more common infections COVID-X will just transfer back to humans again.</p>
<p>Have a look at COVID and mink to see what could happen. Once that bottle is open we will be stuck with COVID despiye a vaccination program.</p>

&#8220;The mRNA process is different it is designed to replicate in your body… That is your body makes the target protein by the same process a virus replicates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Partially correct. The cells make the protein, that is correct. The result is that the viral protein is presented to the immune system in the exact same way as during a viral infection. Which explains the high efficacy of the vaccines.</p>
<p>However, nothing is &#8220;replicated. Least of all the injected mRNA. RNA is degraded pretty quickly in cells. That is why you need a second boost of the vaccine.</p>

				</p>

				<p>I offer two clarifications/corrections of what Clive wrote above.  My knowledge is slight, so I welcome any corrections which cite dependable sources.</p>
<p>========================</p>
<blockquote><p>it does not decay with time but will increase with time until your immune system brings it down, if it ever can</p></blockquote>
<p>I interpreted &#8220;it&#8221; to mean the mRNA vaccine process.</p>
<p>Here is my divergent understanding:</p>
<p>The mRNA vaccine exists in the patient&#8217;s body for a short time, breaking down in a time frame of hours to days [1].</p>
<p>During its short persistence, the vaccine can enter certain cells, and exploit their internal protein production mechanisms to make SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.  Some of those spike proteins can escape their host cells, and be carried in the patient&#8217;s circulatory systems, triggering immune system response.</p>
<p>The vaccine does not copy <em>itself</em> &#8230; it does not &#8220;increase with time&#8221;, but rather decreases rapidly.</p>
<p>The spike proteins do, of course, increase with time &#8212; there perhaps being none present at the time of vaccination.  Their production will continue until all of the mRNA has broken down.  Their numbers will increase until limited by any combination of (a) mRNA deterioration, (b) immune system response, and (c) the normal filtering/excretion processes for stray proteins.</p>
<p>But these &#8220;manufactured&#8221; spike proteins will vanish from the patient&#8217;s body regardless of any immune system response.  The process is <b>not self-sustaining</b>.</p>
<p>Within a few days of an mRNA vaccination, the patient&#8217;s body is empty of the vaccine itself, and the cell-synthesized spike proteins.  What persists, are the products of the patient&#8217;s immune response.</p>
<p>[1] mRNA is a little like the ephemeral mesons inside atomic nuclei, which are &#8220;exchange particles&#8221; mediating the relationship between the persistent nuclueons.  mRNA does its work of transferring DNA sequences to cytoplasm very quickly, and can break down within minutes of its formation.</p>
<p>========================</p>
<p>The reference to prions rose particularly to my attention.</p>
<p>By my reading, prions can only be formed by PrP, a protein found in healthy individuals throughout the animal kingdom, composed of a specific sequence of 253 amino acids.</p>
<p>No misfolding, or other modification, can transform arbitrary proteins into prions.</p>
<p>Surely it&#8217;s conceivable that an error in the synthesis of other proteins might, by unhappy accident, produce a prion.  I leave the computation of the probability of such events as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>========================</p>
<p>Again, if I got the foregoing wrong, I welcome authoritative correction.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I was reading a text on nuclear power plant design (such is the dull fare of MarkH) in which I found a passage which stayed with me.</p>
<p>The author (a veteran of contentious licensing hearings) wrote that when critiquing safety design, it is always possible to postulate some set of simultaneous or sequential failures which will lead to a catastrophic outcome, no matter how conservative or redundant the design might be.</p>
<p>I understood from this, that the degree of risk/safety cannot be meaningfully inferred from the ability to hypothesize such failures; or put another way, imagination is not analysis.</p>

Excellent explanation, very clear.</p>
<p>I would like to add a little thing. You write:<br />
&#8220;Some of those spike proteins can escape their host cells, and be carried in the patient’s circulatory systems, triggering immune system response.&#8221;</p>
<p>The beauty of the design is that, if I understood it correctly, the spike proteins are presented on the cell membrane just as if the virus had really infected the cell.</p>

<p>If the concept you presented is correct, and the host cells are transformed into &#8220;Covid impersonators&#8221; with the same spike proteins on their surfaces &#8230; that is an amazingly elegant way to train the patient&#8217;s immune system.</p>

<p>Re: <i>You can always argue that you should refrain from acting. But doing nothing has costs too. Inaction can kill too.</i></p>
<p>And therein lies Herd Immunity Policy&#8230; Do Nothing, Let Em Die for the Economy, Let em Die for Bezos/Musk/Trump and BREXIT.</p>
<p>The good news is today Spain suggested they will have achieved Herd Immunity by Summer 2021.  A combination of Herd Immunity Policy (killing off  the most vulnerable) followed by Oh-So-Sorry Shutdowns and a vaccine blitz program.</p>
<p>IF we were all supposed to die-off to get Herd Immunity Policy (aka Herd Die Off) to work why are the governments jumping on the bandwagon of Get A Vaccine NOW???</p>
<p>When was the last time a government did ANYTHING of benefit for you personally?</p>
<p>Is Bezos running out of minions of his warehouses? Is Musk looking for more victims for his enterprises now located in the Great State of Texas?</p>
<p>Give it a think..</p>
<p>I will get a vaccine. Yes. I will do Due Diligence to make sure I (CAPITAL EYE) understand the risks before that happens. I salute all who take first chances to prove it works when the companies and systems that produce it, and give it, in the USA, have 100% indemnity and protection if anything goes pear shaped.</p>
<p>If they thought it was THAT good.. why would they they do that?</p>
<p>Give it a think&#8230;</p>
<p>NOTHING in the USA is done for FREE, for you, for the benefit of the citizens-population. NOTHING.  It&#8217;s all about the money..</p>
<p>Give it a think and thank your stars you are not in the USA.</p>

				<p>@JonKnowsNothing @MarkH @All</p>
<p>re: imagination and analysis</p>
<p>In even the most technical fields, it will be found that the rare exceptional practitioner has the ability to meld both imagination with mathematical, or other specialized analytically skills. Needless to say, imagination not based in analysis quickly leads to dead ends.</p>
<p>But consider an IC chip designer. That job certainly requires a high degree of visual and spatial imagination, as well as a high level of electronics (=mathematical) skill.</p>
<p>The work of physicist and historian of science Gerald Holton (e.g. Thematic Origins of Scientific Thought: Kepler to Einstein) clearly shows how the origins of scientific breakthrough often arise from a sense of the physical situation rather than direct mathematical insight, which comes later. For those interested, on the Amazon page for the title mentioned, there is a somewhat long, very informative review which focuses on the case of Einstein.</p>

<p>I just discovered a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/opinion/covid-bats.html" rel="nofollow ugc">long article</a> the NY Times published two days ago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about bats, their relationship to people, and the implications of that relationship for the health of bats and humans.</p>
<p>The article is interesting and informative, and certainly touches on your concern about environmental degradation.</p>
<p>According to my reading, there&#8217;s a substantial consensus among those who study the origins of pandemics that the conservation of wildlife habitats &#8212; and especially, protection against human encroachments &#8212; could prevent many future pandemics.</p>

				<p>Wow the vaccine debate here is making my head spin. All that I can contribute is that I know some of the people from the Pfizer vaccine team personally. Pfizer pulled it&#8217;s top talent off of projects that are much more important from a P&amp;L point of view and put them on the COVID team. I know people who participated in the trials who based on the most common side effect, injection site soreness, probably got active vaccine. None of these people have any hesitations.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the kicker. Because the vaccine is 95% effective, it makes no nevermind to the people who do take the vaccine that you choose not to. You may be signing your own death warrant but the because the efficacy is so high no one who takes the vaccine has to worry about your inability to understand the science or your hubris that makes you think you know more than the top experts in the field.</p>
<p>So doubters, doubt if you wish. The suspicious out there, go on nurse those suspicions. At the end of the day it&#8217;s your own funeral.</p>
<p>I personally would like to see you all live or at least not die from a disease that there&#8217;s a good vaccine for. At the end of the day, I can&#8217;t change anyone&#8217;s mind, but my only motive in posting this is to get people to consider the implications of their choice.</p>

<p>re: <i>I know some of the people from the Pfizer vaccine team personally. Pfizer pulled it’s top talent off of projects that are much more important from a P&amp;L point of view and put them on the COVID team.</i></p>
<p>Oh&#8230; well, I&#8217;ve been on projects like that too. Generally means the project is a coffin-candidate and they bring in the A-Better-Team to see if it can be resuscitated.</p>
<p>As to the debate about treatment and vaccines:</p>
<p>Debate is good because there is really not much data flowing out from the vaccine makers, a good deal of hyperbole, an awesome amount of marketing-slime, but not much data that is of interest to folks who are hanging out here.</p>
<p>You might want to try out Jair Bolsonaro, that dude guy in Brazil running their death march.  He signed up for 100M doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca for 212M population and plans a quick 5 month roll out. They are still trenching their 181,000 deaths so far.</p>
<p>Zho.. what does Jair Bolsonaro know that we don&#8217;t know? He hasn&#8217;t opted for Pfizer vaccine either.</p>
<p>Perhaps since, M Bolsonaro is immune ATM &#8217;cause he had a round of COVID-19 earlier, he figures if he continues with his Herd Immunity Policy and gets to the 70% level they won&#8217;t need to spend money on a vaccine?</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read what the Eradication Countries are planning. These are the folks who do not ever need a vaccine provided they keep the rest of us out of their country or properly setup in a 14+ day quarantine.   They get to keep their money in their pockets and anyone going there for trade, travel or return, will have to pay the extra 3-5K for hanging out in a quarantine hotel (unless you are VIPofVIPS).</p>
<p>Still lots to know&#8230; and I know nothing&#8230; (see handle)</p>

				<p>Note on the SolarWinds backdoor.</p>
<p>FireEye is calling it Sunburst.</p>
<p>DHS is calling it Solarigate.</p>
<p>Here is some IOC info grabbed just grabbed from pastebin.  Microsoft has still not made a publicly available report at this time of writing.</p>
<p>Below assembled by Ken Westin, collected by Kim Zetter.</p>
<p>Solarigate IoCs</p>
<p>Based on global telemetry, we have seen seven malicious DLLs related to this incident so far. The following list is non-exhaustive, as the situation develops:</p>

<p>The attackers have compromised signed libraries that used the target companies&#8217; own digital certificates, attempting to evade application control technologies. Microsoft already removed these certificates from its trusted list. The certificate details with the signer hash are shown below:</p>
<p>&#8220;Signer&#8221;: &#8220;Solarwinds Worldwide, LLC&#8221;,<br />
&#8220;SignerHash&#8221;: &#8220;47d92d49e6f7f296260dalaf355f941eb25360c4&#8221;</p>
<p>The DLL then loads from the installation folder of the SolarWinds application. Afterwards, the main implant installs as a Windows service and as a DLL file in the following path using a folder with different names.<br />
• installation folder , for example, :)Program Files (x86))SolarWinds)Orion)SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayerdll<br />
• the NET Assembly cache folder (when compiled)<br />
C:\Windows1System32\configlsystemprofile\AppData\Local\assembly\tmp)&lt;random-named folder) SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll</p>
<p>While Microsoft researcher observed malicious code from the attacker activated only when running under SolarWinds.BusinessLayerHost.exe process context, for the DLL samples currently analyzed, Microsoft Researchers have also seen different SolarWinds processes potentially loading the malicious library. The following list is again non-exhaustive as the situation is still developing at this point. We recommend monitoring the history and network or process activity of this SolarWinds process closely, especially activity coming from<br />
SolarWinds.BusinessLayerHostexe:</p>
<p>• ConfigurationWizard.exe<br />
• NetflowDatabaseMaintenance.exe<br />
• NetFlowService.exe<br />
• SolarWinds.Administration.exe<br />
• SolarWinds.BusinessLayerHost.exe<br />
• SolarWinds.Collector.Service.exe<br />
• SolarwindsDiagnostics.exe</p>

				<p>@ MarkH, FA, Winter,</p>
<blockquote><p>that is an amazingly elegant way to train the patient’s immune system.</p></blockquote>
<p>It uses part of the normal &#8220;budding&#8221; or asexual reproduction mechanism&#8230;</p>
<p>The active genetic part of the virus be it RNA or DNA is usually quite susceptable to it&#8217;s environment outside of a cell cytoplasm. Thus it usually needs protection which can be a protein capsid &#8211;where the protein forms flat sheets which fold up along vertices just like various polyhedra&#8211; which can also be covered with a lipid coating that forms the &#8220;viral envelope&#8221; through which various protiens push.</p>
<p>The active genetic part of the virus often tries to be efficient &#8211;see retroviruses&#8211; thus minimize it&#8217;s size by limiting what it carries around information wise. So it does not always carry the information to code up the protective coat, it just steals it from the cell as it is expressed.</p>
<p>That is simplified it buds outwards pushing out some proteins and rips away parts of the cell outer lipid layer as it&#8217;s coat in the process. Often damaging the cell beyond repair thus releasing other chemical messengers such as interferons that attract the bodies defence mechanism.</p>
<p>Think of it if you want a realy oversimplified view like a young child dragging their finger through the cream layer on top of a sweet pie or cake, or pushing their fingers up through a layer of bubbles on the top of their bath water. Some of it sticks to the fingers due to nuclear forces that give us the various forms of physical attraction amenable to mathmatical modeling, thus analysis.</p>
<p>So the &#8220;amazingly elegant way&#8221; is in effect a standard chemical way not just of viral pathogens but many many other processes not all of them to do with living organisms (think about the chemical layer between air and water for bubbles which can cause droplets of water to sit on top of large volumes of water).</p>
<p>Amazing as it might look it&#8217;s just a result of the same processes that give us surface tension from atraction and repulsion ultimately down through chemistry into physics and nuclear forces.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the short version and yes there&#8217;s lots of detail left out you can pick at to your hearts content.</p>
<p>But if you actually want to know it in more depth then &#8220;go look it up&#8221; there are lots of Wikipedia and similar pages you can trawl through but ultimatly you get down to what we currently understand about those nuclear forces, and you might conclude that isn&#8217;t much. But it&#8217;s the sort of thing that breadth across many arts gives you that oddly as it drills right down often gets left out of depth in a an art explanations because it&#8217;s just seen a side track from more important things to do with your time.</p>
<p>Which kinda flies in the face of less than thoughtful assertions such as,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; all breadth and no depth – this makes any debate completely useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>It kind of indicates that the originator of the assertion has a limited outlook on well, quite a lot really.</p>
<p>As yellow cab drivers in New York are oft want to say &#8220;You all have a nice day&#8221;.</p>

&#8220;what does Jair Bolsonaro know that we don’t know?&#8221;</p>
<p>How much money he has available to set up a -75 C cold chain and buy the vaccines?</p>
<p>The Oxford vaccine is not only cheaper, but also usable in the developing world. Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine is not usable outside the (very) rich world.</p>

&#8220;So the “amazingly elegant way” is in effect a standard chemical way not just of viral pathogens but many many other processes not all of them to do with living organisms&#8221;</p>
<p>What you are looking for is the antigen presentation machinery, the Major Histocompatibility Complex:<br />

<p>This is what processes (foreign) proteins and presents them to the immune system for evaluation and, if necessary, action.</p>

				<p>Just another little titbit about the <em>Joys of Surveillance</em>:</p>
<p>U.S. Schools Are Buying Phone-Hacking Tech That the FBI Uses to Investigate Terrorists<br />
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/u-s-schools-are-buying-phone-hacking-tech-that-the-fbi-1845862393" rel="nofollow ugc">https://gizmodo.com/u-s-schools-are-buying-phone-hacking-tech-that-the-fbi-1845862393</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Gizmodo has reviewed similar accounting documents from eight school districts, seven of which are in Texas, showing that administrators paid as much $11,582 for the controversial surveillance technology. Known as mobile device forensic tools (MDFTs), this type of tech is able to siphon text messages, photos, and application data from student’s devices. Together, the districts encompass hundreds of schools, potentially exposing hundreds of thousands of students to invasive cell phone searches.</p></blockquote>
<p>and more</p>
<blockquote><p>“Cellebrites and Stingrays started out in the provenance of the U.S. military or federal law enforcement, and then made their way into state and local law enforcement, and also eventually make their way into the hands of criminals or petty tyrants like school administrators,” Cooper Quentin, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said in a video interview. “This is the inevitable trajectory of any sort of surveillance technology or any sort of weapon.”</p></blockquote>
<p>and still there&#8217;s more &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fourth Amendment protects people in the United States from unreasonable government searches and seizures, including their cell phones. While a search without a warrant is generally considered unreasonable, the situation in schools is a little different.</p></blockquote>
<p>etc &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Ultimately, Gizmodo’s investigation turned up more questions than answers about why school districts have sought these devices and how they use them. Who is subject to these searches, and who is carrying them out? How many students have had their devices searched and what were the circumstances? Were students or their parents ever asked to give any kind of meaningful consent, or even notified of the phone searches in the first place? What is done with the data afterward? Can officials retain it for use in future investigations?</p></blockquote>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<blockquote><p>SolarWinds</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah when I was reading the article from your original post,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8216;March and June of this year may have been subverted by what it described as a &#8220;highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state.'&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Did catch my eye&#8230; It brought forth the thought of a &#8220;black hatted pointy chined&#8221; &#8220;Spy-v-Spy&#8221; agent using sophisticated social engineering techniques to get a job, in the mail room where they could swap the disks by hand in the outbound &#8220;updates&#8221;&#8230; But then those times of busy mail rooms and real letters and mail are long long gone.</p>
<p>And that in essence is the problem. In a 1980&#8217;s company you had an office block and mail room that was issolated from the world by the physical limits of building security. If you wanted to see what people were saying you had to get into the building and in effect cause massive disruption if you eanted to see in every letter. Which made such attacks mostly impossible.</p>
<p>But zoom through a third of a century or so, &#8220;people don&#8217;t do paper&#8221; any more&#8230; They just dash out a quick email reply. So much so that they nolonger think about what it is they type, thus they say more way more than is perhaps wise. Which makes the Email a way more attractive target, especially as getting at everyones Email boxes is as easy as getting at just one, and best of all you don&#8217;t have to &#8220;go get a job&#8221; as a mailboy&#8230;</p>
<p>Thus we come to the crux of the issues of &#8220;Efficiency-v-Security&#8221; email is in theory more &#8220;efficient&#8221; but in &#8220;practice&#8221; it has no security to talk of&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes it&#8217;s a recurent theme in almost all security vulnerabilities the push for &#8220;efficiency&#8221; is the enabler. And yes I keep mentioning it in the vain hope people will think about it.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not the only thing I mention from time to time. Some years ago on this blog before Stuxnet poped it&#8217;s head up I had a chat with @Nick P about the failings of &#8220;code signing&#8221; and why it actually ment next to nothing as a security measure.</p>
<p>As your later posting shows some one has demonstrated the point yet again, so whilst a surprise for some who are young, old&#8217;uns have seen it before. Again pointing out something else I mention from time to time &#8220;ICTsec does not teach it&#8217;s history&#8221; thus gets condemed to relive it over and over&#8230;</p>
<p>But trying to hide out of the lime light is Microsoft and it&#8217;s &#8220;Software as a Service&#8221;(SaaS) 365 that many governments run especially the elected and executive parts for &#8220;efficiency&#8221; that is realy &#8220;penny pinching&#8221;. We know this is a bad idea and have said as much for decades. But even when the then head of GCHQ under scrutiny in a UK Parliment enquiry told them that, because GCHQ was &#8220;collecting it all&#8221; as it went by&#8230; nobody appeared to listen the faux efficiency of &#8220;trim the fat&#8221; through the muscle and &#8220;to the bone&#8221; and other demented neo-con mantras held sway, and security lay there crushed and bleeding under foot of the &#8220;self entitled&#8221;, &#8220;filling their boot&#8221; and enriching themselves at others expense and the &#8220;common good&#8221;.</p>
<p>So whilst this is &#8220;shock horror&#8221; to some, it&#8217;s &#8220;just the same old same old&#8221; to others.</p>
<p>But one point to note, whilst one of the four US &#8220;Cyber-existential-threat nations&#8221; on the &#8220;US list&#8221; is being blaimed as usual, in the very Orwellian way the US has made it&#8217;s very own, there are many tens of nations that not only could have done it but are currently doing it one way or another&#8230;</p>

<p>re:<i> Oxford in Brazil </i></p>
<p>So are you suggesting that Bolsonaro is making a better decision to wait and avoid the difficult supply chain and risk of supply chain failure for an over priced vaccine, and take the good cheaper one?</p>
<p>Oxford made a statement that they would roll out their vaccine before EOY.  They published all the data (1,2) including the flub in the trials that ended up to be beneficial.</p>
<p>1, Oxford had indicated not long ago that they would not be shipping until Q3 2021. Today they announced they would be shipping in @2 weeks. iirc it&#8217;s the 1/2+1 dose version.</p>
<p>2, No I have not reviewed the data, I was hoping you might do that or someone with a better medical background to do an analysis summary. (3)</p>
<p>3, No worries, I&#8217;ve been looking at 4 walls for a year now. No rush to get outside.  California is parking lot of portable morgue trucks and they are filling fast.</p>
<p>Our local experts have just infected 300+ people in care homes this week.</p>
<p>All skilled nursing homes, hospitals, care centers, health care corporations have 100% exemption from claims or law suits for COVID-19 related incidents.  That means the 300 families have zero recourse to hold anyone accountable.</p>
<p>Ask &#8220;How did they infect 300 vulnerable people in a week?&#8221;<br />
Answer &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>And these are the same people who are in charge of a highly technical and vulnerable supply chain for the Pfizer vaccine &#8230;.</p>
<p>If it goes south there is no recourse and no one will be picking up the tab for the 30 years of after-event care&#8230; It&#8217;s a USA thing.</p>

&#8220;But one point to note, whilst one of the four US “Cyber-existential-threat nations” on the “US list” is being blaimed as usual,&#8221;</p>
<p>Moscow poisons people with polonium and a newly developed nerve poison, shoots down passenger planes, blows up power stations, gave us Petaya, Cozy Bear (nicely filmed at work), and spies (in person) attacking the MH17 investigation. That is beside the support of European dictators and &#8220;rebels&#8221;, and cyber attacks on European countries and EU institutions.</p>
<p>From all the candidates Moscow is both the most likely (Bayes) and the very best for publicity. No one cares when it was Bhutan doing it.</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s easy to be misled by so-called facts quoted out of context.  Consider:</p>
<p><b>Did 4 COVID-19 Vaccine Trial Patients Develop Bell’s Palsy?</b><br />
The FDA wrote: &#8220;The observed frequency of reported Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;So are you suggesting that Bolsonaro is making a better decision to wait and avoid the difficult supply chain and risk of supply chain failure for an over priced vaccine, and take the good cheaper one?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, Brazil could not deploy the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines even if they wanted to. They simply lack the infrastructure and money to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;, Oxford had indicated not long ago that they would not be shipping until Q3 2021. Today they announced they would be shipping in @2 weeks. iirc it’s the 1/2+1 dose version.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 1/1 + 1 dose version needs new Phase 3 research. Their original numbers were on to few volunteers, and the wrong ones at that. As long as the Oxford vaccine is not certified, it is anyone&#8217;s guess when it will become available.</p>
<p>Anyhow, all plans had to be made months ago, when the Oxford vaccine was still planned for the latter half of 2021.</p>
<p>In 6 months another 1+ million people will have died of COVID and the world economy will have tanked another 2 times or so. Better start now with a vaccine that has shown NO problems in tens of thousands of volunteers. This vaccine will not be usable in the developing world, but we can at least save some lives with it.</p>
<p>And it has to be stressed, you CANNOT prove something is safe.</p>
<p>Even the Oxford vaccine can have some unforeseen effect because of a quirk in one of the components. The biggest disaster in this light is the narcolepsy following 2009 Pandemrix Influenza vaccination in Europe. This was (most likely) caused by the ASO3 adjuvant (i.e., NOT the actual antigen).</p>

<p>Hey, we cannot be held responsible when your compatriots are unable to organize anything at all.</p>
<p>We have been able to follow the dysfunctional nature of USA government on all levels in exquisite detail. However, we can not help you in this, that is something the people of the USA have to sort out themselves. And mRNA vaccines are not the cause of your problems.</p>

				<p>@ Winter,</p>
<blockquote><p>From all the candidates Moscow is both the most likely (Bayes) and the very best for publicity. No one cares when it was Bhutan doing it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you for reinforcing my point.</p>
<p>The US policy of just pointing Orwellian style[1] to a single attacker &#8220;far far away&#8221; from just a list of four[2] causes people not to think critically or correctly when making judgments. It&#8217;s as bad as saying &#8220;Muslim Terrorists&#8221;, &#8220;black street criminals&#8221;, and other stupidities like &#8220;It&#8217;s t&#8217;butler wot did it Gov&#8221; of a &#8220;Penny dredful&#8221;.</p>
<p>Appart from showing that the US hierarchy is treating US citizens as though they are six years old, it more importantly gives other nations and actors a &#8220;free pass&#8221; when they are attacking the US or it&#8217;s corporation&#8217;s for IP etc.</p>
<p>Worse even minimal camouflage by the attacker causes supposed independent computer security investigation companies to fall in line with the US executive list of &#8220;Cyber-existential-threats&#8221; or current one in the Orwellian Barrel[2].</p>
<p>Which makes any &#8220;False Flag&#8221; operations much more easily hidden behind what is self made false attribution. If people do not think the likes of the Dutch, French, Israeli, Swedish, and other supposed &#8220;alied and friendly&#8221; nations are not fairly intently treating US Entities to this sort of APT type activities, then they need to think again. Those countries know without doubt the US is doing APT etc to them, so they will treat the US to the same &#8220;courtesy&#8221; as equalls should.</p>
<p>Which is another aspect many do not think about. The thing about Cyber-Attacks is that the actually require very little investment to deploy, because you are using other peoples systems against them. As the ability to develop the attack tools is actually quite minimal as well, it can be done in a &#8220;home office&#8221; or room above a shop. Which also means you can do it well out of sight of others just put &#8220;Smith &amp; Co Accountant&#8221; on the door that will keep most away. You do not have physical components to manufacture which could raise suspicion nor do you have large energy usage which can be seen in space, as you do with conventional weapons production. Importantly you do not need tens of thousands of personnel to be trained to operate them. Which is why you can have a very effective &#8220;Army of One&#8221; or two in Cyber-Space. Thus your &#8220;Equals&#8221; may not be who you think they are and the old joke about the 400lb teenager sitting in the back bedroom starting Armageddon does not quite have the same funny ring to it any longer.</p>
<p>The cyber-skills required today are not to far from those of a sniper/intel role in the military. They have to get in and observe the lay of the land, target habits etc and plan how to get in, lay the trap and as importantly out again without being caught or even trailed or identified in any way. Such activities require a certain type of mind set one of which is the ability to work alone in effective issolation being self sufficient for extended periods of time. Such people tend not to stand out except to a trained eye, because they are not invisable, hidden, or grey, just so normal as to be not rememberable as a person though they might have a rememberable dog or other item to draw your attention away from them.</p>
<p>[1] George Orwell pointed out a stratagem in his book &#8220;1984&#8221; which gave rise to the notion of a common enemy for all to unite against. That is rather than admit the realities of life to it&#8217;s population and thus appear impotent, a Nations Executive blaims just a single enemy at a time. Also it only changes the current enemy for a new one for political reasons. Thus slogans and other propaganda unite much of the unthinking or authoritarian following population against remote peoples they can not meet nor in effect harm. In the process it distracts the populations gaze away from those that are realy harming them the Nation&#8217;s Executive. Thus both protecting the Executive and giving the people a scape goat for the Executives gross failings.</p>
<p>[2] The US Orwelian list, of &#8220;Cyber-existential-threats&#8221; appears to contain just these four countries currently &#8211;<br />
 China, Iran, North Korea and Russia. A quick look at US political history and foreign policy and which of these nations &#8220;is in the barrel&#8221; being given the &#8220;tar and feather&#8221; treatment shows an intetesting correlation too great to be even remotely coincidental.</p>

<p>Your Welcome.</p>
<p>Although I get your point, I still think Moscow is the most likely culprit (if I had to bet money on a suspect, they would be it). But that is without any evidence at all. Which means I am willing to exchange them for any other suspect for which evidence can be mounted.</p>

				<p>@ Winter,</p>
<blockquote><p>I still think Moscow is the most likely culprit</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d certainly be thinking in terms of a Super Power, or a nation with a &#8220;keep off our Grass&#8221; type nuclear deterant. Though which one well who the heck knows in this game of &#8220;smoke and mirrors&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the end of the day it&#8217;s HumInt that&#8217;s actually needed, looking at code or even routed packets is not going to give real evidence you can use, especially as getting into routers and computers,in other countries is a criminal act in of it&#8217;s self which in the US atleast makes any evidence collected &#8220;fruit of the poisoned vine&#8221;.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve been hoping for for some time is that people stop treating cyber-crime as cyber-warfare, because of two reasons,</p>
<p>1, The chances of it going wrong and kinetic conflict start are way higher than any sensible person would like.</p>
<p>2, The military are not the way people should be solving crime, that&#8217;s a Police and Courts task.</p>
<p>If more effort was put into dealing with all cyber-attacks as criminal, then International Law has a chance of being put in place, which hopefully would ease tensions.</p>
<p>If we can clear out cyber-crime to a better degree than we are failing to do currently, then cyber-espionage has less places to hide in&#8230; Which might indicate why people are not talking just posturing.</p>

<p>I agree. However, we know governments are happy to use criminals to do the sabotage and reconnaissance for them. The criminal of today&#8217;s hack is the spy of tomorrow&#8217;s and the criminal of the hack the day after.</p>
<p>Better cyber crime fighting is better anyhow.</p>

				<p>@ Robin</p>
<p>Thanks for the snopes reference. Here are some quotes from their write-up, with my emphasis added:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  More importantly, this tweet (and dozens more like it) may give readers the impression that this vaccine caused Bell’s palsy. <b>As of this writing, there’s no evidence to support that assertion.</b></p>
<p>  The FDA noted in its report that four people (out of about 22,000) in the vaccine group developed Bell’s palsy, <b>while no cases were reported in the similarly sized trial group.</b>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that saying &#8220;there’s no evidence to support that assertion&#8221; also means &#8220;there’s no evidence to support a specific, different causality than the vaccine&#8221; &#8212; because, if there was one, they would have reported that. But in these early days, everything is still in the &#8220;fog of war&#8221;.</p>
<p>and another quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Bell’s palsy was reported by four vaccine participants and <b>none in the placebo group</b><b>. These cases occurred at 3, 9, 37, and 48 days after vaccination. [snip]</p>
<p>  The observed frequency of reported Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population, and </b><b>there is no clear basis upon which to conclude a causal relationship at this time, but FDA will recommend surveillance for cases of Bell’s palsy with deployment of the vaccine into larger populations.</b>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Their noting there is no &#8220;clear basis&#8221; means they don&#8217;t have any idea what caused those four cases, but the FDA sure made note of them for future &#8220;surveillance&#8221;.</p>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Pfizer Canada President Cole Pinnow reiterated this point to the CBC:
</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, as long as the President of Pfizer Canada says four cases in the study group to ZERO in the placebo group is just statistically normal, I guess everything&#8217;s going to be just fine. {sarcasm}</p>
<p>The FDA does note that we had better keep an eye out for such side-effects in larger study drug populations.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll be doing. We all must each be able to choose what we want to do with our bodies concerning medical treatment, including when we want to do it. It&#8217;s our inalienable human right.</p>
<p>But I know one thing: I and my family will be saying masked-up for the duration of 2021, and likely longer.</p>
<p>And the FDA sure looks like it understands that emergency use authorization means not all the i&#8217;s have been dotted and t&#8217;s crossed, with the extremely short (most likely highly unprecedented) safety and efficacy studies.</p>
<p>And, remember all: no one in the study groups was sat down and blasted with virus particles to test efficacy, because that would be both highly unethical and probably not so feasible after only around a year of even knowing that this virus exists, much less which mutations the study group was exposed to.</p>
<p>And there is simply no way they could quantify the exposure levels for the study participants, especially given that personal mask use &#8212; regarding style of mask, exposure to ambient viral loads, fastidiousness of mask use, et cetera &#8212; can vary greatly from person to person and moment to moment and general lifestyle (eg: are they retired or a cashier in a supermarket?).</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;d like to wait for an expert opinion of someone whom I know doesn&#8217;t own any stock in Pfizer, not that I trust the top people at the FDA or CDC in Trump&#8217;s administration to be conflict-free either.</p>
<p>I hope that all four of these cases of Bell&#8217;s Palsy are really just normal population levels. That would be great. I hope that the statistics gathered over the course of this emergency roll-out demonstrate safety and efficacy. That would be truly great.</p>
<p>Until then, we&#8217;re going to stay masked-up, living our hermit lifestyles and staying t f away from other people.</p>
<p>Thanks, Robin, for pointing us to the truth as we can as yet ascertain it. More data from more participants over a greater duration will increase confidence levels &#8212; that&#8217;s how statistics works!</p>
<p>As always, I welcome corrections to my understanding of this topic.</p>

&#8220;Note that saying “there’s no evidence to support that assertion” also means “there’s no evidence to support a specific, different causality than the vaccine”&#8221;</p>
<p>A swelling of the facial nerve where it leave the skull is generally the cause.</p>
<p>The prevalence of Bell&#8217;s palsey is ~1 per 5,000-10,000 per year. In a group of 40,000 people (the total phase 3 trial) a total of 1-2 cases per 3 months is expected. 4 : 0 cases in two groups is then, indeed not statistically significant. There is no need to suppose nefarious intentions.</p>
<p>With only 4 cases, widely different in time since vaccination are not basis for finding a different cause. Especially as it is often difficul to find the cause in spontaneous cases.</p>
<p>During the same time, 162 subjects in the placebo group contracted COVID and 8 in the vaccine group.</p>

				<p>ADDENDUM</p>
<p>First, in the second snopes&#8217; quote I excerpted, the bolding should end after &#8220;none in the placebo group&#8221; and begin again before &#8220;there is no clear basis&#8221;.</p>
<p>Also, I hope everyone that wants to get vaccinated as soon as possible will be able to do so. That is as much their human right as refusing it, and I would never criticize someone for doing so because a) it will likely not harm the vast majority of them, and b) peace of mind is a real thing, as the Placebo Effect is almost certainly even greater when it&#8217;s the Study Drug.</p>
<p>But, vaccinated or not, we all need to keep wearing our masks and not breathing all over each other in poorly ventilated spaces. Until we have much more definitive data about who is shedding and who is not, that is.</p>
<p>Side note: I worked a contract in Finland many years ago, and found it very refreshing (hardy har-har-har) that their regulations required all office windows to be openable. The window in my tiny office had a double double-paned window with a little hand-crank to open and close it all of maybe six inches. Wow, that Helsinki air was fresh during a long night cranking code. Here in America, I&#8217;ve never had such a luxury and when the outside temperature is around the thermostat&#8217;s setting, the air inside stops moving and becomes a turgid soup of exhale. Yuck!</p>
<p>And there have even been recent studies suggesting that packed conference rooms achieve ugly levels of CO2 very quickly. It reminds me of my favorite fail poster: &#8220;None of us is as dumb as all of us.&#8221; All so the corps can save a few dollars on their HVAC bill.</p>

				<p>Re attack attribution:</p>
<p>The &#8220;big four&#8221; suspect states are very different from the average of other states in key aspects of their international relations &#8212; though it&#8217;s important to consider that they&#8217;re also quite different from each other.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, to be trusted as an international actor is of enormous value as a national asset.  States which largely comply with: broad international law; the terms of their treaties; and rule of law internally, benefit significantly in terms of economic advantages and their ability to influence joint international undertakings.</p>
<p>Their are certain kinds of foreign interventions &#8212; for example, invading and warring against a peaceful neighbor &#8212; which can be extremely damaging to the precious capital of international trust; and the damage once done takes a lot of time and work to repair.</p>
<p>A high-trust state tempted to commit such outrages must weigh the self-destructive cost [1].</p>
<p>For a low-trust state, the incremental cost of such criminality is vastly less.</p>
<p>Further, once a state has endorsed international criminality as its <em>modus operandi</em> &#8212; with the consequence that it is near the bottom of trust rankings &#8212; it may benefit in some circumstances from its &#8220;negative reputation.&#8221;  Its willingness to commit international outrages becomes a different kind of capital, from which certain kinds of useful leverage can be obtained.</p>
<p>To the extent that this perspective is valid, I suggest that there is very large variance (assuming rational decision-making by governments) among states, with respect to their likelihood to launch (among other things) information system attacks which are likely to give rise to great concern or anxiety.</p>
<p>In such case, the existence of a compact list of &#8220;usual suspects&#8221; is not, <em>per se</em>, evidence of a non-factual bias.</p>
<p>[1] Even if &#8220;false flag&#8221; attacks are as manageable as some seem to believe (color me skeptical), the risk of detection cannot be reduced to zero.  As the great Clive Robinson taught me in many comments written here, to prevent the leakage of information is enormously difficult.  Based on a realistic assessment that such subterfuge might be defeated, the attacking state must <em>still</em> weigh the cost in case it is &#8220;caught.&#8221;</p>

<p>re: <i> And it has to be stressed, you CANNOT prove something is safe. </i></p>
<p>Given the difficult supply chain for Pfizer temperature controls what I would have liked to see is a report that said if the Pfizer vaccine rises above n-degrees C/F the shipment has a self-destruct component so it cannot be used. Perhaps vaccination sites have such information as do the transit depots or storage areas.</p>
<p>Same would apply to Moderna mRNA version. That doesn&#8217;t have the same extremes but still requires cold store.</p>
<p>There are vaccine production failures frequently.  Not that many years back, about half the global supply of flu vaccinations was contaminated during production.  Given the long time to produce the required mix for &#8220;this year&#8217;s flu&#8221; it meant a rationing system was put in place.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to prove &#8220;safety&#8221; but you do have to show minimal side effects and that the vaccine works.  95% effective against what standard?  That&#8217;s 5% direct failure.  85% effective against what standard?  That&#8217;s a 15% direct failure.</p>
<p>5% of phone calls or internet connections failing? 5% of your paycheck disappears? 5% of stop lights malfunction?</p>
<p>5% may not sound like a lot but I can tell you if you miss picking up the garbage from 5% of a city of a million households the phone banks will meltdown as 50,000 households call in to find out why you didn&#8217;t collect the trash.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m very disappointed that the oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine wont be available in the US for a while.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all for vaccines and get a flu shot whenever I can (and others e.g. TDAP) I want the Oxford one and not the mRNA ones.</p>
<p>Simple math and finance shows why it will be available in the summer at the earliest.<br />
$4/dose vs $33 since AstraZeneca is not profiting like that Startup that got a lot of govt. funding. And that is despite the complex cooling requirements. At least the news made me chuckle when they talked about vaccine delivery in a bit that stated that drones are the solution for vaccine transport/delivery. (sigh)</p>
<p>But then again, what other country has such a complex confusing and outdated way of &#8220;electing&#8221; a president?</p>

				<p>@JonKnowsNothing:</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m reading too much into your comment, but perhaps you are making a presumption of ignorance, incompetence, and carelessness?</p>
<p>I remember back in the 1970&#8217;s seeing gadgets intended for addition to product shipments which would visually indicate to the receiver whether temperature or shock (G-loading) had exceeded some threshold at any point.</p>
<p>I believe that all mobile phones contain stickers which permanently change color when wetted, so that vendors can identify a non-warranty drowning when a dead phone is presented to them.</p>
<p>=============================</p>
<p>Prior to the first fission bomb test, somebody wondered whether the bomb&#8217;s core temperature &#8212; which would surely exceed by a large factor any temperature ever before seen on Earth for an extended object &#8212; might ignite some other type of chain reaction in the atmosphere, ending all life on the planet.</p>
<p>Physicists did the calculations, and concluded &#8220;unless our measurements of key parameters are off by several orders of magnitude, the answer is no.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that many who learned this story have thought, &#8220;how could they be so irresponsible, taking such a risk even if they thought it to be very small?&#8221;</p>
<p>But another interpretation is that those folks actually knew what they were doing.</p>
<p>=============================</p>
<p>Probably, you would struggle to find anyone with a more hostile attitude toward pharma than me.</p>
<p>But the cardinal vice &#8212; rapacious self-interest &#8212; can also function as a virtue (see, I really am a Taoist).</p>
<p>Which scientists want to be known as the ones who put their imprimatur on a dangerous or defective vaccine, anticipating that most of the world&#8217;s eyes would be laser-focused on their failure?</p>
<p>Which pharmaceutical companies want to go down in history as the perpetrators of the &#8220;Great 2021 Covid Vaccine Disaster?&#8221;</p>
<p>=============================</p>
<p>My projection of the most probable cases:</p>
<p>• the folks making and verifying these things know what they&#8217;re doing</p>
<p>• some things will go wrong</p>
<p>• the health benefits will far exceed the health costs</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get where you&#8217;re coming from, with respect to 95%.</p>
<p>Most vaccines are less effective than that, but are very successful at preventing disease due to herd immunity.  Anything 90+ is really excellent.  It doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect, to save countless lives.</p>

<blockquote><p>SolarWinds is saying that it is likely that less than 18,000 customers affected.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK but which &#8220;18,000 customers&#8221; are affected? Because it makes a major difference.</p>
<p>Look at it this way 18,000 corner coffee shops over the Western World, who realy cares?</p>
<p>However what about the top 18,000 government agencies and military manufacturing corporations in the Western World, who wouldn&#8217;t care?</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not always the quantity that counts, but the quality&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The former is a question of appetite, the later much more a question of &#8220;taste&#8221;.</p>

<p>re: <i>presumption of ignorance, incompetence, and carelessness?</i></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been too long in computers to know that the above is much better place to start than the other end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>There are lots of folks here I would trust Top-Down (Clive, Bruce, Winter, SpaceLifeForm, yourself and a bunch more).  After the short list ends, it&#8217;s way better to start from the other end.</p>
<p>Anyone can make an error; it happens. I do it regularly.</p>
<p>Anyone can mess up something; it happens. I once wired about 100 special loopback connectors backwards&#8230; shyte.</p>
<p>The magnitude of error also matters.</p>
<p>For a cheapo loopback connector, I redid the wiring &#8211; no damage done.</p>
<p>When it comes to my breathing? I&#8217;m going to make sure that the loopback connector is wired correctly before I get punched.</p>
<p>tl;dr<br />
Watching some scuba divers getting ready to go, they were supposed to buddy-check each other. One dude&#8217;s buddy was more interested in the water and not so much his friend&#8217;s gear.  The buddy headed to the water and his friend didn&#8217;t realize his breathing line was tangled under his safety vest.  I got his attention before he entered the water.  He did not look pleased with his safety buddy&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know jack about scuba diving but I tell a tangled air line even so.</p>
<p>Knowing that I can visually verify the status of a box of vaccines is like having a safety buddy that actually is looking out for you.</p>

<p>&emsp; * @Winter provided some great links which helps with the above.<br />

				<p>@jon willfully knows nothing</p>
<p>Your glib dismissal of how Pfizer assembled it&#8217;s team despite the very obvious flaw in your argument that there wasn&#8217;t any covid &#8220;dud&#8221; vaccines because prior to the team forming there was no COVID-19 to be working on.</p>
<p>You then merrily spiral down to Brazil evoking the &#8220;wisdom&#8221; of Bolsonaro who I would say has a good command of how to run an autocracy but zero knowledge of virology.</p>
<p>As I said, happy to hear you won&#8217;t be in the vaccine line. More for everybody else. Me, I&#8217;m content to bet on science. I launched 24 drugs in my career and the science was right every time. That&#8217;s not to say that all drugs are without adverse events, but science tends to identify them pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Enjoy your ruminating and navel gazing.</p>
<p>PS Asked a friend who was a world renowned trauma surgeon who had developed cancer if he was pouring himself into the literature surrounding his condition. His response was &#8220;why the fuck would I do that? I&#8217;m a trauma surgeon not an oncologist. Why would I second guess the doctor I have selected?&#8221;</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<p>RE : SolarWinds &#8211; Insider Attack.</p>
<blockquote><p>When they are saying ‘supply chain’, they are blowing hot gaseous material.</p></blockquote>
<p>All that we know about the,&#8221;supply chain claim&#8221; comes from SolarWinds, Microsoft, and FireEye, via a &#8220;jumble up&#8221; of press reports.</p>
<p>And the story appears to be that an update with backdoor/RAT ability appeared on SolarWinds download site, signed by a SolarWinds code signing key.</p>
<p>Now if the story is true there are questions to be asked, not least of all is &#8220;What precautions do SolarWind developers take with the code signing key and download site?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because there are only a limited number of possibilities to what is a &#8220;KeyMat Compromise&#8221;.</p>
<p>The first question as to how such a KeyMat Compromise occured is &#8220;From Inside or Outside?&#8221;</p>
<p>The assumption being made is &#8220;Outsider&#8221; and that they are from Russia.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m guessing everybody is trying to avoid the &#8220;Insider&#8221; and that they were &#8220;working under US IC agency control&#8221;&#8230; With the agency being NSA, CIA, or DoJ/FBI.</p>
<p>Thus is this yet further evidence[1] that the &#8220;Knowledge of Backdoors always leaks&#8221; hypothesis is true?</p>
<p>Thus your,</p>
<blockquote><p>Hunch. There are dots between Barr resignation and SolarWinds backdoor.</p></blockquote>
<p>Taking out the &#8220;human cognative dissonance&#8221; issue, and adding in the assumption that SolarWind are &#8220;handeling their KeyMat and download site appropriately&#8221;&#8230; Then yes from a &#8220;technical perspective&#8221; such an insider attack is more likely than an &#8220;Outsider&#8221; got at the code signing certificate or somehow has discovered a new cryptanalysis attack on hashes.</p>
<p>I guess we are going to have to wait and see&#8230;</p>
<p>[1] The Jupeter Networks &#8220;backdoor&#8221; is probably the first known to the public  proof that information on backdoors leaks.</p>

				<p>@ Clive, ALl</p>
<p>“Knowledge of Backdoors always leaks”</p>
<p>One way or the other.  Either there is an insider, or someone takes the time to reverse-engineer.</p>
<p>Probably both in this instant case.</p>
<p>As SW has had numerous CVEs over the past 14 years, and they most certainly ate their own dog food, they have likely been owned for many years.</p>
<p>There is a report out there that their ftp password was admin123, found on github, last year.</p>
<p>While I have no reason to believe that is fact, I also have no reason to discount it either.</p>
<p>What is nuts, is, why did they leave the backdoored software online until today?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost like they were hoping that some, thinking, wow, I have not updated in over a year, would still then update and get the backdoor.  IIRC, no official fix until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Remember the bit-flipping router.</p>
<p>Remember the biT-flipping routeR.</p>

<blockquote><p>I’ve been too long in computers to know that the [presumption of ignorance, incompetence, and carelessness] is a much better place to start than the other end of the spectrum.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a long time in computers, too.</p>
<p>I think I can readily understand your experiences and how they&#8217;ve influenced your perspective.  As I&#8217;ve written here before, most software is produced at quality levels bordering on criminal negligence.</p>
<p>Probably most of us have had plentiful exposure to &#8220;Clown College&#8221; engineering organizations.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen many examples of professional programmers writing the example book for &#8220;Never Ever Do This&#8221; practices.  I&#8217;ve met people with EE degrees who showed complete ignorance of principles without which &#8212; I should have imagined &#8212; obtaining such a degree would be impossible.</p>
<p>So I believe that I understand where you&#8217;re coming from.</p>
<p>========================</p>
<p>However, our frequent exposure to such incompetence is not evidence that there aren&#8217;t groups who function much higher.</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t recently built bridges collapse every week?  Why aren&#8217;t people on the ground constantly crushed by jets falling from the sky?</p>
<p>Over-generalization from personal experience is, I think, an example of the availability heuristic.  This cognitive bias in favor of what we can readily recall and visualize predisposes us to wrong conclusions.</p>
<p>========================</p>
<p>I offer a cautionary example, but I&#8217;m sure you can think of many more:</p>
<p>Climate-change skeptics often say things like, &#8220;how do we know that solar variability doesn&#8217;t cause the temperature trends?&#8221;</p>
<p>Their implicit presumption is that the community of climate scientists has been too stupid / lazy / careless to address such questions.  These statements clearly indicate the <em>actual</em> locus of stupidity, laziness and carelessness &#8230; but they don&#8217;t see it.</p>
<p>That we can find ignorant and careless work everywhere we turn, is not evidence that there aren&#8217;t people functioning steadily at much higher levels.</p>

&#8220;Their implicit presumption is that the community of climate scientists has been too stupid / lazy / careless to address such questions. &#8221;</p>
<p>There are too many such examples to count. Laypeople have a knack of &#8220;correcting&#8221; immunologists about vaccines, linguists about language learning and spelling, doctors about health, security specialists about computer security, criminologists about crime, and lawyers about the law. And I assume car mechanics and plumbers have the same experiences.</p>
<p>I would like to suggest a quote from Charles Darwin (especially the first part):<br />
<em><br />
Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.<br />
</em></p>

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing, ALL,</p>
<p>The UK has a new COVID variant.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55308211" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55308211</a></p>
<p>Another one to add to the list, it&#8217;s being blaimed for the new increases in LockDown measures in a large part of South East England and all of London.</p>
<p>But&#8230; They are saying it&#8217;s no different to the other strains&#8230;</p>
<p>So apply a little logic,</p>
<p>1, It&#8217;s no more infectious.<br />
2, It&#8217;s to blaim for infection rises.</p>
<p>At first glance would appear to be at odds, hence people getting skittish about it. But<br />
whilst it is entirely possible due to human agency via an increase in gregarious behaviour or people &#8220;comming in doors due to less clement weather, you would expect other indicators to show up, which apparently have not, which may be due to the &#8220;drag effect&#8221;.</p>
<p>So I guess we are just going to have to wait and see what changes happen over the next month or two which unfortunatly is going to have a big problem in it in the UK. We have a relaxation for &#8220;the winter solstice celebrations&#8221; which whilst it is pragmatic is probably not a good idea.</p>
<p>And before people ask, I&#8217;ve decided not to partake, not because of COVID &#8211;though it is a good excuse&#8211; but I just don&#8217;t like it I&#8217;m not the Yo Ho Ho or Let&#8217;s be jolly and play lots of party games type. In the past if I could not find well paid overtime / contract work I used to go off solo camping, which now at my age and health is not as much fun and the Dr gives you one of those &#8220;It&#8217;s ill advised&#8221; looks. So for me it&#8217;s going to be just another &#8220;average 2020 day&#8221; well not quite I think something a little more exiting than opening a can of corned beef is in order 😉</p>

				<p>@Clive @SpaceLifeForm @All</p>
<p>re: <i>New Variant COVID-19 in UK </i></p>
<p>I spent some time looking for more details on this variant but didn&#8217;t find anything more than general public consumption statements.</p>
<p>Here are some bits of interest:<br />
&emsp; * 1,000 infections<br />
&emsp; * 60 locations<br />
&emsp; * genome shared with WHO<br />
&emsp; * genome likely shared with other Gov Science Groups<br />
&emsp; * genome has a &#8220;deletion&#8221; (one or more sequence(s) no longer there)<br />
&emsp; * genome deletion maybe involved in transmission<br />
&emsp; * genome change is to the spike protein (this varies by report)</p>
<p>To recap previous science findings:</p>
<p>There are 22+ variants that have Antibody Escape changes.  These are commonly occurring mutations that may affect different antibodies. These 22+ variants are not wide spread but are not uncommon. (N439K from Scotland)</p>
<p>Up until now the only major change to the COVID-19 virus is the D614G change to the spike protein and is now the current global variant. The D614G variant replaced the original COVID-19 virus from the earlier days (see: &#8220;STOP THE PLANE!! @SpaceLifeForm).  So we have had 1 full global swap out of the virus.</p>
<p>D614G change enabled the virus to hook to the ACE2 receptor much easier than the original version. There are more ACE2 receptors in the lungs which is why COVID-19 presents as a respiratory disease. (1)</p>
<p>The Mink-COVID-19 (Y453F) change to the spike protein aka F-spike had 5 genome changes. The Denmark SSI (CDC types) identified them as Cluster 1-5 but only Cluster 5 was of importance now referred to as <b>ΔFVI-spike</b></p>
<p>It also has deletion sequence:  H69del/V70del<br />
&emsp; * 69-70deltaHV &#8211; a deletion 36 of a histidine and valine at amino acid positions 69 and 70 in the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit</p>
<p>At the time of the information during the Danish Mink Cull (2), their testing of the ΔFVI-spike showed a resistance to low-levels of antibodies but there was no resistance to high-levels of antibodies.</p>
<p>What might be of interest is that the F-spike (Y453F) changes were found in other countries (post above in this thread)(3).</p>
<p>If you consider the findings in Utah, which is a long way from Denmark, unless the 2 farms were exchanging personnel or breeding stock, the F-spike (Y453F) is likely to arise from any close cage environment where humans bring in the initial virus.</p>
<p>Any member of the mustidae family is susceptible to COVID-19 virus. There have been no official reports on the global veterinary sites of wild mink etc being found with COVID-19. There are a few oblique references to dead mink found outside their cages or escaped mink being captured and killed.</p>
<p>There are a good number of ferrets in the UK. Did a human-ferret-human chain happen?</p>
<p>1, The ACE2 positions is only slightly different between humans and minks. The F-spike allows the virus to hook to the mink location easier but it can still hook to the human location due to the proximity. The position change also allows the F-spike to connect to multiple ACE2 receptors either on the same cell or different cells.</p>
<p>2, Mink disposal in Denmark: is still ground heaving and seeping into the ground water and the nearby lake with last count of several million more dead mink still to be dispose of.</p>
<p>3, Comment on F-spike in other countries<br />

<p>re: <i>fracturing urls </i></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been asked many times 🙂</p>
<p>There are pre-fetches and parsers that scan urls in the background.  They haul in all sorts of stuff on the assumption you will be looking at it.</p>
<p>There are other methods people use to block these items too like hXXps which is more formal method. A good regex will fix that link as it is easily recognizable when parsed. Putting a space in may or may not bother the parser and regex re-linker.</p>
<p>If there is a break in the link provided, the person can see the full link (not just the text part) and decide if they want to follow it or not on a copy-paste.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a personal preference.</p>

				<p>@Clive @All</p>
<p>A bit more is seeping out on the new variant.  It&#8217;s not that new.</p>
<p>The variant is N501Y with 7 mutations-deletions.</p>
<p>From Oct 2020 the N501(S+Y) mutation was noted in these areas of the UK.</p>
<p>&emsp; &#8211; N501S in GR clade England<br />
&emsp; * N501Y in GR clade England Wales.</p>
<p>The area of interest is the same deletion as in the Mink-COVID Y453F: <b>H69del/V70del</b><br />
&emsp; * 69-70deltaHV – a deletion 36 of a histidine and valine at amino acid positions 69 and 70</p>
<p>These deletions are quite common and found in many genome sequences.</p>

				<p>@Goat @Clive @All</p>
<p>There are a number of places where such things can be blocked or different pathways to take.</p>
<p>consider: Your browser vs someone else&#8217;s browser</p>
<p>Yours might block things and the other guy&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t.  I don&#8217;t know which browser folks might be using or if they are using any at all.</p>
<p>consider: the underlying crap-capturing systems</p>
<p>Your browser might protect your visual or direct usage but way below that on the junk heap of connections there are lots of folks parsing messages, web pages and logging all sorts of &#8220;useful&#8221; things for &#8220;useful&#8221; reasons.</p>
<p>Putting a block on the top so it doesn&#8217;t display does not mean that the underlying connections are not parsing things.  News reports are chock-a-block with invisible markers and links that carry &#8220;click counters&#8221; all of which are normal business for internet news.</p>
<p>Again, I don&#8217;t know what sorts of connections or history logs are being generated and there&#8217;s no point in adding a link to it particularly if you aren&#8217;t interested it the topic.  Once you copy+paste then the link will be added to your ad-value history.</p>
<p>There is also site-scrapping, it used to be called spidering.  These systems scan pages, like this blog, and suck up all the links as well as topics.</p>
<p>@Clive&#8217;s mentioned a fair few times about folks scraping up his concepts for their own profit. I have an unsubstantiated impression that perhaps there are some who have been scrapping the blog&#8217;s COVID-chats.</p>
<p>Another item to consider are: tiny-urls</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t know where or what or anything about these and where they go. They may take you to a video link by the long-path or to twit-posting.  Quite common now but worth thinking about what&#8217;s under the click-stream.</p>
<p>ymmv; mine often does.</p>

&#8220;Vaccine only supposedly prevents severe symptoms, in those who are not outright killed by the jab.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, it is supposed to prevent infection. The vaccine might not reach this goal for all. But that is because humans are imperfect and so are medical drugs and vaccines.</p>
<p>Noone has yet been killed by the jab, out of 20,000+ volunteers. But 1.5 million people have already died from not having had the jab.</p>
<p>No one here will object to you pass on the vaccine and let someone else get vaccinated instead of yourself.</p>

<p>re: <i>getting the wuhan lab product</i></p>
<p>The &#8220;original&#8221; Wuhan virus is not available. Sorry sold out.</p>
<p>The original strain of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-1) which was discovered in Wuhan, China is extinct in the global population. The virus mutated and the one currently circling the globe is SARS-CoV-2.   You can apply at any unmasked-holiday-party for a sample.</p>
<p>re: <i>getting sick even when vaccinated </i></p>
<p>Only if you are very unlucky.  You might have enough luck to be the unlucky one.</p>
<p>The other end of the effective number is the possible number of unlucky persons who will have &#8220;vaccine failure&#8221;. The bigger the first number the less chance you have of having that unfortunate experience.  You can increase the odds of overwhelming your body immune response by hanging out with the red hatters while cheering loudly enough to get a good deep lung full of the COVID-19 viral cloud.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one way to find out which side of the % scale you are on.</p>
<p>re: <i> being infectious to others after vaccination </i></p>
<p>This might happen under a few conditions.</p>
<p>&emsp; a) You are already sick before you get the jab. Lots of folks running about pre-symptomatic.<br />
&emsp; b) You were in a trial and got The Other Option in which case you didn&#8217;t get the vaccine for COVID-19.<br />
&emsp; c) You got a vaccination for something else like the Flu which is Influenza virus not COVID-19 virus and thought you were safe at first base.</p>
<p>Be sure you get the right jab for the right condition.</p>
<p>re: <i>  hoping this will stop lockdowns and mask mandates (everyone not aware of the facts) are going to be very disappointed when the MSM is forced to admit the truth </i></p>
<p>Too late! MSM has beat you to it and is informing people that it will take a long time to vaccinate the planet.</p>
<p>If that hasn&#8217;t occurred to you that vaccinating 7.8 BILLION people + all the new generations born every minute, might take a while, you&#8217;ve missed the LARGE PRINT.</p>
<p>Your real challenge is figuring out who is and who isn&#8217;t. You will no doubt have fun trying to decide Mask On or Mask Off.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t get a movie role, regardless of which one you chose.</p>
<p>re: <i>The Big Picture </i></p>
<p>There really isn&#8217;t much debate about getting a vaccination. The debate is which VERSION of the vaccinations works best for any given group or sub group and which one(s) provide the best protection for the least risk of having &#8220;vaccine failure&#8221;.</p>
<p>The small print next to the LARGE PRINT about how &#8220;it&#8217;s gonna take a while&#8221;, is that you might need to get a booster shot sometime between &#8220;Now and Then&#8221;.  This duration isn&#8217;t known but is expected to be 6-12 months.</p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t really gotten this far because they are counting on enough people taking the vaccine to achieve the 60-70-80% coverage of the local population(s) where you hang out.  If your area has 80%+ of the people vaccinated, the virus cannot find a new host after @45 days.</p>
<p>45 days is the time that governments, like the USA under former President Trump, did not take at the beginning of the pandemic to lock down and eradicate the virus. People with No Masks and No Social Distancing voted with their behavior to take &#8220;Money in exchange for Deaths&#8221;.</p>
<p>Are you enjoying your purchases?</p>

<p>small quibble&#8230;</p>
<p>re:<i> 1.5 million people have already died from not having had the jab </i></p>
<p>1.5 million people died because of economic decisions made by governments like USA, Sweden, Brazil and others.  These governments opted for keeping their Economies Running even on Life Support rather than provide the necessary financial  support to allow people to safely remain at home for 45 days to clear the virus.</p>
<p>1.5 million people died because they didn&#8217;t:</p>
<blockquote><p>STOP THE PLANES!<br />
 to quote SpaceLifeForm </p></blockquote>
<p>1.5 million did not die because they didn&#8217;t have a jab.  There was NO JAB to give.</p>
<p>1.5 million died because there is no cure. There is better treatment in some countries.</p>
<p>There is still no support in most of the countries who selected Herd Immunity Economic Policy as their response to a global pandemic.  This policy is about killing the greatest number of older people, people with preexisting conditions, and those that are perceived as a drain on their respective economies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an old story: beggars are expendable, only the wealthy are worthy.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen exactly how far The Wealthy will go once they think they are safe from the plague. Historically they didn&#8217;t go that far. Currently some countries are starting to roll back to their previous comfort zone of policies:  making examples of the beggars that are left.</p>

&#8220;1.5 million did not die because they didn’t have a jab. There was NO JAB to give.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly. If they have had a jab, they would have been saved. However, because people stopped funding SARS-1 vaccine development after the SARS outbreak of 2003-2004 petered out, there was no jab to have.</p>
<p>I am not blaming the victims. Their demise was not their fault in any way.</p>
<p>Luckily, when the next Ebola outbreak comes, there will be a vaccine because this time, against all odds, people did continue developing the vaccine even after the epidemic was over.</p>
<p>@Jon<br />
&#8220;1.5 million people died because of economic decisions made by governments like USA, Sweden, Brazil and others.&#8221;</p>
<p>A country gets the government they deserve. People vote for dysfunctional leaders, they get dysfunctional leaders. The situation in Sweden was a little more complicated, with legal obstacles to appropriate measures.</p>
<p>Also, some countries were taken wholly by surprise.</p>
<p>@Jon<br />
&#8220;This policy is about killing the greatest number of older people, people with preexisting conditions, and those that are perceived as a drain on their respective economies.&#8221;</p>
<p>I seriously doubt that in most countries. Not every country is governed by Narcissists and Psychopaths.</p>
<p>@Jon<br />
&#8220;It remains to be seen exactly how far The Wealthy will go once they think they are safe from the plague.&#8221;</p>

If you’re interested in the end of the world, you would have been interested, soon after Donald Trump’s election as US president, to read a New York Times headline stating that Peter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist who co-founded PayPal and was an early investor in Facebook, considered New Zealand to be “the Future”. Because if you are in any serious way concerned about the future, you’re also concerned about Thiel, a canary in capitalism’s coal mine who also happens to have profited lavishly from his stake in the mining concern itself.

				<p>Even if it seems quite far fetched to some, at least personally and until the facts dictate otherwise, I tend to view the resulting disease COVID-19 that emanates from an infection with SARS-Cov-2 as a form of airborne acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.</p>
<p>See for example:</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 RNA reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome</p>
<p>Liguo Zhang, Alexsia Richards, Andrew Khalil, Emile Wogram, Haiting Ma, Richard A. Young, Rudolf Jaenisch</p>
<p>doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.12.422516" rel="nofollow ugc">https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.12.422516</a></p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding and recurrence of PCR-positive tests have been widely reported in patients after recovery, yet these patients most commonly are non-infectious. Here we investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for PCR-positive tests. In support of this hypothesis, we found chimeric transcripts consisting of viral fused to cellular sequences in published data sets of SARS-CoV-2 infected cultured cells and primary cells of patients, consistent with the transcription of viral sequences integrated into the genome. To experimentally corroborate the possibility of viral retro-integration, we describe evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse transcribed in human cells by reverse transcriptase (RT) from LINE-1 elements or by HIV-1 RT, and that these DNA sequences can be integrated into the cell genome and subsequently be transcribed. Human endogenous LINE-1 expression was induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection or by cytokine exposure in cultured cells, suggesting a molecular mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 retro-integration in patients. This novel feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain why patients can continue to produce viral RNA after recovery and suggests a new aspect of RNA virus replication.</p>

<p>COVID-19 is most certainly not an Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. Immunity stays intact. However, reverse transcription and integration of the viral RNA in the DNA is a worrying sign (and interesting).</p>
<p>If this survives peer review (this is a preprint) it will make the headlines.</p>

				<p>These clowns in the MSM apparatus don&#8217;t have the slightest idea how sience works.</p>
<p>Science is not about a community, it is solely about the truth. There are several hypothesis about the origin of this pestilence, none of them have much credible empirical facts behind them this far, so to ban specifically the lab origin hypothesis because the community of liberal woke cryptocommunist researchers and their woke fanboys don&#8217;t like the idea that they are the culprit is ludicrous.</p>
<p>These woke fukkers are engaging in lysenkoism but not anything resembling science.</p>

<p>Strange response. I do know what Acquired Immunodeficiency is, thank you. I also know that it is NOT a symptom of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The preprint about integratiin of the SARS 2 genome into host DNA is interesting, but the relevance of it is difficult to judge as SARS 2 does not carry the reverse transcriptase gene necessary to do it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you seem to be unwilling to respond to my remarks about COVID19 not known to causing Immunodeficiency. The paper I saw did not say anything like that.</p>
<p>So, what is your point? Do you have a point?</p>

				<p>@Windy et al:</p>
<p>I suspect a simple mistake in reasoning.</p>
<p>In the abstract you kindly quoted, I see nothing about immune system effects.</p>
<p>The description of their hypothesized mechanism, and the term &#8220;retro-integration&#8221;, is understandably suggestive of the HIV retrovirus, which does indeed suppress immune responses.</p>
<p>However, there are many retroviruses, and most of them don&#8217;t cause global immunosuppression like HIV does:</p>
<p>retrovirus ≠ immunosuppresive virus</p>
<p>If indeed SARS-CoV-2 <em>were</em> immunosuppressive, I think it extremely probable that this would have been widely recognized by now as a clinical aftereffect.  Doctors could hardly fail to notice such damage in their patients.</p>
<p>But no such clinical findings have yet emerged.</p>
<p>In fact &#8212; and I think I commented about this in the schneier blog &#8212; one hypothesis for the lingering illness some unfortunate Covid patients have, long after the virus has left their bodies, is that their immune systems are <em>too</em> active, causing autoimmune damage.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s widely recognized that the most acute Covid symptoms leading to death are at least partly caused or aggravated by the intensity of the patients&#8217; immune system reactions to the virus.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m aware of no reason at all, to suspect or believe that this virus is immunosuppressive.</p>

<p>You said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  However, it is the basis of all science.
</p></blockquote>
<p>No, science is nothing less than the seeking of objective truth. However, it also encompasses the set of scientific principles that establish the accepted methodologies used in the seeking, in order to promote objectivity and accuracy.</p>
<p>That the vast majority of people in 1904 didn&#8217;t know the objective truths Einstein was about to unveil in his Miracle Year papers has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that the objective truth was always there or that leading-edge scientists were working on unearthing them.</p>
<p>This what you fail to understand: just because you haven&#8217;t yet learned or don&#8217;t admit that a truth exists, doesn&#8217;t mean that that truth doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>And the D&amp;K low achievers probably almost never admit that it&#8217;s their crappy ideals, attitudes and behaviors that keep them from becoming high achievers. But if they do see the need to change, then there is no other place they can start than by critical introspection with an eye to self-evolution in those three fundamental areas: ideals, attitudes and behaviors.</p>
<p>This ability to self-evolve is not only our fundamental nature as moral human beings with free will: it is also our fundamental responsibility. Every single problem on Earth is the result of our societies&#8217; collectively willful ignorance on this simple fact and all its ramifications.</p>
<p>The following two questions define most human beings&#8217; perspective here in 2020: What has your society persuaded you to be? Why do you refuse to even listen to the ideas of other societies?</p>
<p>A person that doesn&#8217;t continually reorient and refine their moral compass either drifts aimlessly and selfishly or unquestioningly moves in the direction their societies steer them towards. As a result, they never have any truly good advice on the direction others should take, but that doesn&#8217;t prevent them from thinking they can and should.</p>
<p>The moral state of this world in 2020 is a direct affirmation of the findings of D&amp;K with respect to our collective lack of moral education, self-evolution and introspection as individuals and communities.</p>

The bleeping computer link regarding the dangers of malware on pastebin type services is informative. For the security professionals who read this blog, it’s probably old news, but for the rest of us, highly recommended.</p>
<p>As far as the trolls who are suddenly swarming around lately, if any of the vacuous pseudo-argument, personal insults, and other rude behavior means anything other than spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt, it will be surprising. Indeed, a lot of it may be even less meaningful than that. It’s obvious that hand waving invocation of Kruger Dunning is particularly hilarious and self-damning of those who engage in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;First you ask for evidence, then as explained in a previous post of mine, my posts that contain multiple links get stuck awaiting moderation and consequently pastebin is used to link the requested scientific papers&#8221;</p>
<p>The use of pastebin whilst not recommend for good reason, is also entirely unnecessary.</p>
<p>The number of links you have can not be large, so why not just post one or two again, they should get through this blog software without problems.</p>
<p>This generall also alows for greater authentication of the documents as well.</p>
<p>You probably could have got all of your links across in the space you&#8217;ve wasted arguing against what is a reasonable request.</p>

				<p>@All<br />
&#8220;@Windy<br />
Even I ain’t clicking a pastebin link.&#8221;</p>
<p>A small explanation of my suspicions.</p>
<p>My initial worry with this opaque link was a story I read years ago about how opaque, shortened links were used to harvest the IP addresses of commenters on a blog. The perpetrator used these to harass and dox the people he did not like. I do not know pastebin.com so I cannot say whether this might be a problem. But when I could not visit it using a tor browser. Then, why bother?</p>
<p>However, there are also these Pwned to Own challenges and phishing attacks that often involve clicking a link. Now I learned that pastebin is a plain text service. This would make an attack quite difficult, but I suspect not impossible.</p>
<p>Now, why should I visit some obscure text site to learn about some scientific research?</p>
<p>Then @Windy started to insult me and press ridiculous claims about COVID-19 causing a kind of AIDS. The first identified case of such a COVID symptom would splash all the front pages in the world. I have not seen these headlines, so I am very skeptical.</p>
<p>And @Windy does not give a human readable title, reference, or abstract.</p>
<p>Pressure to visit an opaque link to see outlandish claims, what could go wrong?</p>

&#8220;Thanks. Now I know even more surely that I’ll not be reading Popper’s work. &#8221;</p>
<p>And I that I do not have to read anything your write about Science.</p>
<p>@rrd<br />
&#8220;And I’ll take a wild guess that Popper has nothing to say about morality.&#8221;</p>
<p>The title of these three books is: The Open Society and its Enemies.</p>
<p>But I think Popper had a different view of morality than you have.</p>

				<p>.<br />
<b>SARS-CoV-2 DNA retro-integration</b></p>
<p>Thanks to Windy, for calling attention to this news, notwithstanding a misinterpretation of its meaning.</p>
<p>Online posting of preprints (proposed scientific papers not yet officially published) has been an important part of Covid-19 research, because it&#8217;s such a fast vector for dissemination.</p>
<p>Those who want to know the <b>facts</b> about Covid need to be aware that these preprints are often wrong.  Two of their inherent defects are:</p>
<p>• the &#8220;single study&#8221; effect &#8212; what hasn&#8217;t yet been reproduced often <em>can&#8217;t</em> be reproduced</p>
<p>• complete lack of review</p>
<p>A famous example was an early French paper claiming to show efficacy for HCQ in Covid cases.  It was dead flat wrong.</p>
<p>Fortunately, for those of us lacking the expertise to read such preprints critically (i.e., almost every human being), interesting preprint results usually receive plenty of attention and critique from those who <em>do</em> possess the expertise.  For example, that notorious HCQ preprint was trashed up hill and down dale by other medical researchers within just a day or two (for very serious methodology failures) &#8230; although this didn&#8217;t stop people from <em>one U.S. political sector</em> from citing it for months.</p>
<p>So the moral is:</p>
<p>preprint + expert commentary = real news</p>
<p>Luckily for us, a <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/coronavirus-may-sometimes-slip-its-genetic-material-human-chromosomes-what-does-mean" rel="nofollow ugc">piece in Science Magazine</a> presents both a thumbnail sketch of what the paper (cited by Windy) says, and reactions from other researchers.</p>
<p>My reading of the salient points about the preprint:</p>
<p>• the preprint&#8217;s finding of DNA retro-integration was in laboratory cultures, NOT human patients</p>
<p>• the preprint cites sample human DNA sequences (from Covid patients) as consistent with their culture findings</p>
<p>• they found evidence only for <em>fragments</em> of SARS genome copied into DNA, not the <em>whole</em> genome</p>
<p>Note well, that retro-integration of fragments does NOT made SARS-CoV-2 a retrovirus.  In order to the the &#8220;retrovirus trick,&#8221; it&#8217;s necessary to get the entire virus genome intact into host DNA, so that DNA will cause copies of the virus to be manufactured.</p>
<p>For emphasis:</p>
<p>• the integration the authors say is happening could not lead to the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2</p>
<p>• the preprint seemingly does not demonstrate retro-integration into <em>nuclear</em> DNA</p>
<p>Cells have and use DNA in the cytoplasm, and that&#8217;s where SARS-CoV-2 does its work.  If I understand correctly, only edits to nuclear DNA will be copied when the cell divides (if, indeed, it survives viral colonization long enough to divide).</p>
<p>From the Science article:</p>
<blockquote><p>The authors emphasize that their results don’t imply that SARS-CoV-2 establishes permanent genetic residence in human cells to keep pumping out new copies, as HIV does.</p></blockquote>
<p>========================</p>
<p>As to the commentary from other researchers, many find it interesting and a pointer to further investigation.  Some are skeptical or even scornful: it&#8217;s a <em>very</em> preliminary result requiring a great deal of follow-up.</p>
<p>========================</p>
<p>The tl;dr from MarkH:</p>
<p>The preprint findings, if confirmed, don&#8217;t seem to have any significance at all for the illness or recovery of Covid patients, the effective of treatments or vaccines, etc.</p>
<p>Why this finding is important &#8212; if true! &#8212; is that it could explain why some people are testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 after appearing to fully recover from Covid.  Fragments of coronavirus DNA might remain in their bodies for many months after infection, having the effect of &#8220;spoofing&#8221; genetic tests.</p>
<p>This phenomenon could confuse studies of COVID-19 treatments that rely on PCR tests to indirectly measure changes in the amount of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in the body.</p>
<p>So, it could be significant for testing, but otherwise has no clinical importance.</p>

&#8221; the preprint’s finding of DNA retro-integration was in laboratory cultures, NOT human patients&#8221;</p>
<p>Nice write up. Some additional information.</p>
<p>To transcribe the SARS2 RNA into DNA a specific enzyme is needed, Reverse Transcriptase. This enzyme is not part of SARS 2 (or any Coronavirus). This enzyme is specific for retro-viruses. Humans &#8220;normally&#8221; also do not have this enzyme in their cells. So, it could be that the enzyme was supplied by another retro-virus also present in the cell, or from an integrated retro-virus already present.</p>

				<p>UK designer&#8217;s wheelchair innovation wins $1m Toyota prize<br />
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/disability-55315442" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bbc.com/news/disability-55315442</a></p>
<p>&#8220;A Scottish designer has won $1m (£753,000) to fund the manufacture of his innovative smart-wheelchair.</p>
<p>Andrew Slorance, who uses a wheelchair himself, won the Toyota-run global Mobility Unlimited Challenge.</p>
<p>===&gt;The Phoenix I uses smart sensors to detect if the user is leaning forward or backwards and adjusts its center of gravity to prevent tipping or falling.*</p>
<p>The team of five at Phoenix Instinct used a &#8220;mammoth&#8221; amount of ===&gt;3D printing to perfect the winning design, an ultra-lightweight manual wheelchair made from carbon fiber.</p>
<p>&#8220;You 3D print it, hold it and look at it,&#8221; Mr Slorance said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can sit in it and if it doesn&#8217;t feel right, you print another one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, you make mold tools. We can fine-tune and tweak it.&#8221;</p>
<p>*My nickel: that is interesting point for other security applications as well.</p>

				<p>EU unveils landmark law curbing power of tech giants<br />
<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/eu-unveils-landmark-law-curbing-power-of-tech-giants/a-55939862" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.dw.com/en/eu-unveils-landmark-law-curbing-power-of-tech-giants/a-55939862</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook, Amazon, Google and others could soon face massive fines in the European Union under draft laws that seek to rein in Big Tech.</p>
<p>The European Union unveiled landmark legislation on Tuesday that lays out strict rules for tech giants to do business in the bloc.</p>
<p>The draft legislation, dubbed the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), outlines specific regulations that seek to limit the power of global internet firms on the European market.</p>
<p>Companies including Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and others could face hefty penalties for violating the rules.</p>
<p>The dual legislation sets out a list of do&#8217;s, don&#8217;ts and penalties for internet giants:</p>
<p>=Companies with over 45 million EU users would be designated as digital &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; — making them subject to stricter regulations.</p>
<p>=Firms could be fined up to 10% of their annual turnover for violating competition rules.</p>
<p>=The could also be required to sell one of their businesses or parts of it (including rights or brands).</p>
<p>=Platforms that refuse to comply and &#8220;endanger people&#8217;s life and safety&#8221; could have their service temporarily suspended &#8220;as a last resort.&#8221;</p>
<p>====&gt;Companies would need to inform the EU ahead of any planned mergers or acquisitions.</p>
<p>=Certain kinds of data must be shared with regulators and rivals.</p>
<p>====&gt;!!!Companies favoring their own services could be outlawed.</p>
<p>====&gt;Platforms would be more responsible for illegal, disturbing or misleading content.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two proposals serve one purpose:<br />
=&gt;To make sure that we as users, as customers and businesses have access to a wide choice of services online just as we do in the physical world,&#8221; she said, adding that<br />
=&gt;&#8221;what is illegal offline is equally illegal online.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agree 100%. But who the hack is Europe to be good the example for us?</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the first time in years that lunar samples have arrived back on Earth. Ground crew are on their way to collect the capsule and its precious cargo.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s Chang&#8217;e-5 moon probe has landed in the Siziwang area of Inner Mongolia in the early hours of Thursday local time, China&#8217;s official state news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Chinese space capsule is carrying 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of samples from the moon&#8217;s surface. These are the first lunar samples to be brought back to Earth for 44 years.</p>
<p>The capsule separated earlier from its orbiter module and performed a bounce off the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere to reduce its speed before passing through and floating down on parachutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>re:<i>N501Y variant called VUI-202012-01 </i></p>
<p>A bit more drips on the &#8220;not-new new&#8221; COVID-19 variant.</p>
<p>gene location: 501<br />
swap N / Y<br />
sub name: VUI = Variant Under Investigation<br />
suffix: 2020 12 &#8211; 01</p>
<p>N501Y has been around for a while, but it appears that something unique is happening in the UK where it is becoming &#8220;dominant&#8221;.  Such dominant mutations have happened before like N439K in Scotland. N439K went extinct in Scotland but appeared/disappeared in other countries.</p>
<p>Currently it is stated there are 17 mutations to N501Y. Fuller details are being held at State Level type labs and WHO.</p>
<p>The N-Y are amino acid code blocks at location 501.</p>
<p>N = AAU Asparagine  changed to Y UAU Tyrosine</p>
<p>The amino acid N Asparagine is defined as &#8220;small&#8221;<br />
The amino acid Y Tyrosine is defined as &#8220;large&#8221;</p>
<p>Reports indicate this mutation altered the shape of the spike protein.</p>
<p>The deletion sequence is also of interest. It occurred in the Y453F ΔFVI-spike that showed some resistance to low levels of antibodies.</p>
<p>69-70deltaHV is a histidine and valine at amino acid positions 69 and 70.   The area is named H69/V70 and in the mutation is missing-deleted. This is a latch to the ACE2 receptor.</p>
<p>In Mink COVID Y453F the position of the ACE2 receptor is slightly different between humans and mink. That part of the mutation was specific to the Mink ACE2 location. The location was close enough for the virus to bounce back to humans.</p>
<p>So Far:</p>
<p>N501Y with 17 mutations and a working code name</p>
<p>An amino acid swap N = AAU Asparagine (small) changed to Y UAU Tyrosine (large)</p>
<p>A shift in the shape of the spike N-Y</p>
<p>An amino acid deletion H69/V70</p>
<p>Significance of DeltaH69/V70 unknown.  This same mutation was in the Y453F ΔFVI-spike.</p>
<p>For Reference:</p>
<p>Lab from Denmark Prevalence Test Results for Y453F:<br />
note: The Delta69/70 was in multiple samples</p>
<p>453F (F-spike)  F   N=142<br />
(A) <b>69-70deltaHV + 453F      ΔF  N=162</b><br />
69-70deltaHV + 453F + 1147L ΔFL N=18<br />
(B) <i>69-70deltaHV + 453F + 692V + 1229I   ΔFVI    N=12</i></p>
<p>A is closest match to N501Y in tabulation<br />
B is the antibody resistant version</p>

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing, ALL,</p>
<p>With regards &#8220;VUI-202012-01&#8221;</p>
<p>Whilst I understand changes have been &#8220;made to the code&#8221; and these end up &#8220;changing the shape&#8221; and other properties of the corona virus.</p>
<p>As far as I&#8217;m aware we do not yet understand the &#8220;programing language&#8221; other than we know it makes objects sequentially via the cytoplasm in the cell and in the case of the spike protien, kind of changes the profile (shape) of &#8220;the lock pick&#8221; for it to get the door open so it can ingress.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you but I find the lack of knowledge, thus the resulting lack of predictive ability frustrating. But then I consider further in the light of what we know about mankind&#8230;</p>
<p>I guess we could look on it as being a modern day version of the problems clasics scholars had with various lost Egyptian languages, where only carved inscriptions remained.</p>
<p>I guess we need to ask if we are at the point where SARS-CoV-2 is going to become the biological equivalent of the &#8220;Rosetta Stone&#8221;,</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone</a></p>
<p>And if so, what will happen with such knowledge. Like all tools it will be agnostic to use. Thus under the hand of a well funded directing mind it could be used for good or evil, and as is often the case, in mankinds headlong rush, a lack of foresight and caution become an evil whilst trying to be used for good&#8230;</p>

<p>re: <i> Reading the code or not&#8230; </i></p>
<p>All of the information is a deep-dive for me too and I spend a good amount of time shifting pages (on-line of course) trying to learning in a few minutes what it takes years to learn at University. It&#8217;s an interesting dive.</p>
<p>There is a code for sure and the ribbon diagrams are &#8220;readable&#8221;.  The ribbons and such all represent some aspect of the protein folds. Some of the listed pages help explain what the images represent.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect from deep-diving is learning about the ribbon diagram itself, explaining how they came up with the curly format.  The maths are definitely above my pay grade but interesting none the less.</p>
<p>In relation to the COVID-19 spike &#8211; it is a protein and the mutations affect how it folds or twists.  If the changes are in a &#8220;unimportant areas&#8221; it&#8217;s not of concern but changes where it connects to the ACE2 receptor in the host, that&#8217;s when alarm bells start to go off.</p>
<p>COVID-19 connects to the host ACE2 receptor. In humans, ferrets and minks, the ACE2 receptor is prevalent in the nose, throat, lungs and in lessor density in other parts of the body.</p>
<p>It is this single area, the spike, where most current vaccines are targeted.  If the spike changes shape, twists, torques then that&#8217;s a problem.</p>

<p>Thank for the link. Very interesting! I won&#8217;t feel so bad about my maths skills now.  Since it can take a supercomputer 366 centuries to solve and an amino acid can fold in less than 1 second.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw the square matrix with charges I thought: Quantum Computing. Alas, there is always some issue with Heisenberg to spoil the fun.</p>
<p>This: <i>Nature does not necessarily achieve global optimization</i> is an interesting insight too. I think Darwin would agree. Lots of duds along the tree. Duds fall out and the non-duds continue until something better comes along and then they fall out too.</p>
<p>Ties right in with the N501Y VUI-202012-01 in UK and the 501.v2 announced in South Afrika.</p>
<p>note: the genomes and mutations are still being determined, limited information in the public sphere.</p>
