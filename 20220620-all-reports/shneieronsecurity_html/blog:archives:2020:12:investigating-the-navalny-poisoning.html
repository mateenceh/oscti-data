				<p>Copying my comment from the weekend squid article (with an edit for context):<br />
The Bellingcat article shows yet again why we need “Tor for the phone network”—i.e., ensuring the network cannot track handsets or people. Tor was initially developed for the US government, because when an American rents a house and just exchanges encrypted traffic with vpn.navy.mil, it’s not hard for the local spies to guess what’s happening. One might expect the article to worry some US government officials, though as [had been said elsewhere in the weekend thread, other parts of the US government like weak systems, because the weaknesses make things easier for their own spies].</p>
<p>[Added:] Apart from the basic onion-routing technology of Tor, we&#8217;d just need randomized IDs (TSMI is already randomised; IMSI, IMEI, non-random MACs, etc, would have to become invisible to local infrastructure) and some zero-knowledge payment or proof-of-previous-payment system. The onion-routing might need to be disabled/weakened for latency reasons when doing realtime voice/video/gaming, which is fine if users know which actions will reveal their locations.</p>
<p>Do we have to wait for extra-sensitive US operations to get burned before anything is done? We&#8217;ve already had Trump&#8217;s non-sensitive phone hacked, according to rumor. Shouldn&#8217;t Germany been pushing for increased privacy, given their past funding of GnuPG etc. and the well-publicized hacking of Merkel&#8217;s official phone?</p>

				<p>The Russian TLAs need a Russian GDPR:</p>
<blockquote><p>
While there are obvious and terrifying privacy implications from this data market, it is clear how this environment of petty corruption and loose government enforcement can be turned against Russia’s security service officers. A few hundred euros could — and does — provide you with months of phone call data for an FSB or GRU officer, allowing investigators to trace the intelligence services’ operations, identify the colleagues of research targets, and follow the physical tracks of spies across Russia and abroad.

				<p>I&#8217;m still having really serious questions about &#8211; poisoning his shorts? Really? Either as a spray, or an ointment, wouldn&#8217;t it have been noticable? I know &#8220;ointment&#8221;, to me, is not a cream, and so would not soak into the shorts, and look greasy. The spray &#8211; there&#8217;s have to be a lot.</p>
<p>The whole story, to me, sounds like something that 30 years ago, everyone would have laughed at. For him to get the agent who&#8217;d actually done it, and keep him on the phone for three-quarters of an hour, seems awfully. questionable.</p>
<p>Could they have gotten him? Sure. Doing it this way?</p>

				<p>One more thing &#8211; did they poison <em>all</em> of his shorts? Does he only have one pair? If all, then the poison should still be in the others&#8230;.</p>

				<p>@ glen or glenda,</p>
<blockquote><p>Apart from the basic onion-routing technology of Tor</p></blockquote>
<p>There is an old joke about a pair of newlyweds that have got lost in the countryside looking for their honeymoon cottage.</p>
<p>The husband on seeing an old man leaning on a gate smoking a pipe, decides to stop and ask directions. So he stops the car and he and his lovely bride approach the old man anf ask if he knows where they want to get to, and if so the easiest way to get there.</p>
<p>The old man pauses and says &#8220;Ey I knows where it is&#8221; then starts knocking out his pipe whilst looking thoughtful. After a minute he looks up and says &#8220;If I was you, I&#8217;d not start from here&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same with TOR there is so much wrong with it, that it&#8217;s not the place you&#8217;ld want to start.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been through this a number of times before on this blog so it&#8217;s easy enough to look up again.</p>
<p>However you are thinking about trying to use two or more mobile devices with privacy is going to cause you another problem you&#8217;ve possibly not considered&#8230;</p>
<p>Mobile terminators change their leaf position in a network continuously. Which gives the issue of how does one mobile find another mobile without going through an arbitrator of some form&#8230; The simple answer is that they can not, which changes the question to &#8220;How do you make the privacy of both mobiles secure through an arbitration service?&#8221; That is &#8220;How do you come up with a secure and privacy enhancing rendezvous protocol?&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not an easy problem to solve, and untill you do, what ever underlying network you use, is going to haemorrhage information about all the users&#8230;</p>

I agree with your comment.<br />
By the same token rioters should never ever get in the same way personal information of the riot police officers: names, addresses, family members, etc. to prevent any intimidation or even harm for fulfilling by police officer their duties.<br />
As I recall, high ranking bureaucrat in Bush junior administration was punished for disclosing CIA female agent information for the general public.<br />
I guess that was absolutely right.<br />
Same applied to confidential informants (CI), undercover officers you name it.</p>
<p>On the subject matter: if that is true, then level of professionalism and training of their toxicology unit (FSB) is very poor. Yeah, when professionalism is not the key parameter for hiring, you do have such results.</p>

				<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_of_the_Future" rel="nofollow ugc"><strong>Russia of the Future</strong></a> (Russian: Россия Будущего, tr. Rossiya Budushchego), originally the <strong>Progress Party</strong> (Russian: Па́ртия Прогрéсса; Partiya Progressa) and formerly known as the People&#8217;s Alliance (Russian: Наро́дный Алья́нс; Narodnyiy Alyans), is a political party in Russia founded on 15 December 2012 by member of the Russian opposition Leonid Volkov and later refounded on 19 May 2018 by Russian government critic and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, &#8230; <strong>The party has a seven-member central committee instead of a chairman.</strong></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>So Navalny&#8217;s party is “progressive” and ruled by an official politburo, with “property protection” policies of arbitrarily seizing wealth from “oligarchs” just as the Communist Party did in the U.S.S.R. under Joseph Stalin.</p>
<p>That “open journalism” isn&#8217;t really so open after all when it’s dictated as it is from behind the scenes by an active politburo. Whether Navalny’s espionage and demagoguery are in line with Mikhail Gorbachev’s offical policies of perestroika and glasnost that tore down the Iron Curtain and ended the Cold War, I have serious doubts, but the U.S. Democrats and “liberals” who have defended Navalny’s journalism and made vicious accusations of Russian interference in U.S. elections appear to have every intention of restoring the Iron Curtain and waging a second Cold War if not an outright nulear strike on Russia, which would be quite unnecessary and unprovoked, although that is what will happen if Joe Biden takes office.</p>

				<p>Re:That “open journalism” isn’t really so open after all</p>
<p>In my previous comment I kind of put all the blame on facebook, though certain other reasons need to be solved to respect open journalism:</p>
<p><strong>How we get to know about the story?</strong><br />
The algorithmic filter bubbles aren&#8217;t doing much good to us, the networked approach founded on trust seems to work somewhat.. All we need is to pop these bubbles and discover some great sources like @Bruce&#8217;s Blog.</p>
<p><strong>Where does the money come from?</strong><br />
I think people are willing to pay, they did pay before the internet, but the friction of payments and donations needs to resolved somehow. I repeat: not everyone can pay in USD, and some people don&#8217;t even enjoy holding cryptocurrencies with fluctuating values and grayish laws.</p>
<p><strong>You are blocking quality journalism: No!!</strong><br />
When I had javascript enabled somehow, I saw this message from a very respected news site. The thing is that mostly the answer is opposite, ads incentives headlines over content i.e. sizzle over facts. The best way around is to actually buy a paper, See the problem here?? Some open journalist kills the other by showing annoyances.</p>

				<blockquote><p>That is “How do you come up with a secure and privacy enhancing rendezvous protocol?”.</p>
<p>It’s not an easy problem to solve, and untill you do, what ever underlying network you use, is going to haemorrhage information about all the users…</p></blockquote>
<p>I have a big problem with the way certificate authorities check ownership based on unencrypted traffic. Despite this farcical basis, it seems likely that Let&#8217;s Encrypt has been helpful to privacy. Similarly, wouldn&#8217;t using even a flawed technology such as Tor be better than simply spamming persistent identifiers everywhere you go? I don&#8217;t understand what you mean when you say the network would &#8220;haemorrhage information about all the users&#8221;—Tor doesn&#8217;t do that, does it? I&#8217;m sure there are attacks that can tease it out, but that&#8217;s nothing like the constant &#8220;haemorrhage&#8221; already happening on telephone networks. Unless the network were actively attack all users, it should greatly reduce the availability of useful logs.</p>
<p>(Maybe I should say &#8220;traffic-analysis-resistant routing&#8221; rather than &#8220;Tor&#8221; per se, though AFAIK, Tor gets the bulk of the research on that topic.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Winter&#8221; suggests Russia needs a GDPR. Sure, good idea, but would it really help in this type of situation? It might drive up the cost of such bribery, maybe make heads more likely to roll afterward, but after revealing an FSB operation, heads will probably roll anyway. Plus, there was international roaming here, which means people not subject to Russian law have some of the information too.</p>

<p>Chemical weapons are not noticeable until you start dying from them, hence the moniker &#8216;chemical weapons&#8217;. They are advanced chemical compounds, and unlike the juice from you juice box, designed for easy dispersal. Any material would dry out very fast leaving behind a severely dangerous residue. One drop of it is enough if dispersed properly, it just takes time to work, and not many people carry atropine on them outside of the battlefield.</p>
<p>If you are being transported by your captors, the flight attendant probably is not going to give you any atropine, and it&#8217;s not likely to be on the menu. Plus this is not your average chemical weapon, this is top line, and you probably need expert medical care. Atropine helps stop chemical weapons blocking messages from your nervous system, so you don&#8217;t suffocate and experience other nasty effects of a failing central nervous system. It also helps if someone is around to administer it, clear your airways, put you in the recovery position, because you&#8217;re probably going to be in no condition to administer first aid to yourself if you got a &#8220;good&#8221; dose.</p>

<p>So atropine is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_antagonist](Muscarinic antagonist) according to Wikipedia. I have come across various species of death cap mushrooms in the area some growing in my yard that probably contain <a href="muscarine" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarine</a> among other so-called nerve agents. Some are quite deadly, strangely not by touch, but one whiff of the odor is faintly earthy at first, then pungent and acrid and almost overpowering to the point of unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Perhaps they grow in the boreal forests of Russia as well and are part of folk lore.</p>

&#8220;freedom from bias&#8221;</p>
<p>Freedom of morals?</p>
<p>The above story is one indeed biased. It starts from the biased position that secretly poisoning political opponents is objectionable. I know that the other side, e.g., the GOP and the Kremlin, have a different moralistic view: Might is Right.</p>
<p>I understand that people who believe in &#8220;might is right&#8221; would object to describing patriots followers of the ruling strong man as mere hit men.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think Bruce would stop writing this blog, and most of us reading it, when he would have to embrace the Might is Right view.</p>

				<p>Well it is an interesting story but I see quite a few issues</p>
<p>Firstly the who. If one might have some doubts abut Bellingcat there is zero question about the allegiances of CNN or der Spiegel. The mere fact that they team up should be a massive reflag.</p>
<p>Then there is the material. I’m sorry but I simply don’t believe that you can buy that much data (they claim access &#8211; in this or previous investigations &#8211; to massive cellphone logs, air travel logs, border control registry, passport databases and “hidden” CCTV surveillance) for a few hundred Euros, even in Russia. The much more plausible explanation is that they have been made privy of that data by some occidental agency. One can not exclude the “useful idiot” theory (ie they actually transacted with someone without knowing the actual source) but this being labelled “open source” investigation is nothing short of laughable. Note also that they do not give access to any of the raw data nor even respond to questions, after having locked their comment.</p>
<p>All in all there is just zero possibility to corroborate, while they make some rather wild claims (the underpants poisoning being quite creative I muss say). Maybe they have uncovered something (with a lot a “external” help), maybe it is complete BS, but If anything I am absolutely certain there is more to this !</p>

&#8220;The mere fact that they team up should be a massive reflag.&#8221;</p>
<p>Especially as Der Spiegel is famous for investigative journalism. It has a very long track record of unearthing secrets. The number of errors and dupes can be counted on one hand.</p>
<p>I trust der Spiegel better than any American or Russian.</p>
<p>But if you do not believe it, you can contact all the players in this drama. Names and office addresses are all given. You can ask them personally.</p>
<p>@AlexT<br />
&#8220;Then there is the material. I’m sorry but I simply don’t believe that you can buy that much data (they claim access – in this or previous investigations – to massive cellphone logs, air travel logs, border control registry, passport databases and “hidden” CCTV surveillance) for a few hundred Euros, even in Russia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Could this be because you simply have no idea how it is in Russia? Instead of giving us an insight into your gut feelings, you could also have given us some solid information on the situation in Russia?</p>
<p>Until then I stay with Bellingcat. If they made this up, the Russians would have told us so.</p>

&#8220;Maybe they have uncovered something (with a lot a “external” help), maybe it is complete BS, but If anything I am absolutely certain there is more to this !&#8221;</p>

<p>@Winter, this was about Snopes not about the above story, as a response to the unwarranted criticism by @xcv, I didn&#8217;t read any Snopes comment on the post. I was just criticising a pseudo-scientific website(i.e. hereistheevidence.com).</p>

				<p>@Winter, now about your actual commment which has little to do with Snopes.</p>
<p>Freedom of morals?<br />
Morals exist and stay morals until they are put to practice. The Freedom of practicing your morals may be restricted(Sometimes rightly so, if they are against other&#8217;s freedoms) but your morals can never be bound(but can be biased).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider Why Do people buy into the might is right view?</p>
<p>The people have nothing to gain, only the oppressor(i.e. leader here) would benefit from such a philosophy. Understanding the brains of such people is beyond my Skillset, but might be useful to plot any real solutions to these problems.</p>
<p>One thing that I can say with certainity is that the alog-censor does contribute to extremism of all kinds&#8230;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact I do. I have been doing business in Russia when it was still called the USSR, regularly travel there, have friends and partners in all manners of places. Is it a corrupt country ? Most definitely. Is anything for sale ? Sure ! Can you get that amount of information for a few hundred Euros ? No. Most definitely no.</p>
<p>Again I am not saying the ultimate information is not genuine (although hardly verifiable). But its acquisition was not as described. Of that I am completely certain.</p>

&#8220;Let’s consider Why Do people buy into the might is right view?&#8221;</p>
<p>It is a personality trait.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian_personality" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian_personality</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
The authoritarian personality is a personality type characterized by extreme obedience and unquestioning respect for and submission to the authority of a person external to the self, which is realized through the oppression of subordinate people. Conceptually, the term authoritarian personality originated from the writings of Erich Fromm, and usually is applied to men and women who exhibit a strict and oppressive personality towards their subordinates.

				<p>@AlexT @ALL</p>
<p>When USSR collapsed, everything went on sale.<br />
People needed to survive, so they sold what<br />
they could steal. Stealing from work was normal<br />
during soviet time.</p>
<p>We traveled to St. Petersburg (Leningrad), to<br />
get electronic components that was otherwise<br />
hard or impossible to acquire back then. People<br />
stole them from the factory and sell on the black<br />
market. Cpu&#8217;s, memory chips etc.</p>
<p>There on black market you could get literally<br />
anything if you only had money. Military stuff,<br />
weapons etc. CD ROMs with DOS based databases were<br />
offered openly. So this all has long, long historical background.</p>

<p>So you give up?</p>
<p>Compared to AlexT as a source of information, the BBC cannot be that bad. Actually, the BBC goes to great lengths to explain how they got their information. That is more than AlexT does. So, as long as you cannot give counter information I stick with Bellingcat and the BBC.</p>
<p>I now have two independent sources that both say the same. You only have your gut feelings, which does not even count as a single source.</p>

				<p>@ ALL,</p>
<p>Perhaps people need to remember that fundamentally a &#8220;market&#8221; needs just two things to exist,</p>
<p>1, Demand.<br />
2, Supply.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a &#8220;chicken-n-egg&#8221; situation as to which causes the other, but there is an old saying in Yorkshire UK,</p>
<p>&#8220;Where there&#8217;s muck, there&#8217;s brass&#8221;</p>
<p>Indicating that if you know what you are doing you can sell anything and make money.</p>
<p>But more pertinently where there is demand, then regardless of legislation or regulation that demand will be supplied if someone is prepared to pay thr asking price. Hence the reason we are currently in a pandemic.</p>
<p>In effect what legislation and regulation does is encorage &#8220;dirty&#8221; or &#8220;black&#8221; markets where you pay a price to a criminal and have no ability to tell what you are getting or recourse if you get harmed. Thus we have drugs cut with various poisons for vermin, bath salts, ground glass and god alone knows what else. Likewise we have bushmeat from sick or even dead animals that are easier to obtain, in some cases smoked in the fumes of what ever can be burnt, such that the rancid nature of the animal flesh and organs is hidden.</p>
<p>So why would anybody assume that it would be hard to get any other commodity especially information?</p>
<p>After all information has the advantage you can copy it and sell as many copies as you can find buyers. As long as a little care is taken the &#8220;originator/owner&#8221; of the data will not even know it&#8217;s been copied in the first place.</p>
<p>All you need to turn someone into a criminal is the same sort of drivers that turn people into &#8220;traitors&#8221; for their home country and spies for another nation. There are several acronyms to describe the human failings one ofvthe older ones is MICE.</p>
<p>In essence a sad fact of life is that given the right circumstances most people will betray anyone to put food on the table for their family or to keep a roof over their heads. So in any organisation you are almost guaranteed to find some one you can &#8220;turn to your advantage&#8221;.</p>
<p>But it gets worse, by far the majority of people even after training are &#8220;to trusting&#8221; thus even a friendly smile and an offer of help, can be enough to get somebodies credentials that get you in to databases you have no reason and should most definately not have access to.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the world we live in, created by people who do such things without a thought, relying on their senior positions in hierarchies to get away with it. Others see it and say to thrmselves &#8220;that could be me&#8221; and so they do it, and so on down the hierarchy.</p>
<p>There is an old joke about politics,</p>
<p>&#8220;The right wing is corrupt at the top, the left wing corrupt at the bottom, which is why democracy is never going to fly.&#8221;</p>

				<p>@ Anders, Clive</p>
<p>Selling stolen stuff (goods or info) for cash.</p>
<p>Just remembered an incident in the 90s.</p>
<p>A customer in Moscow just got the system.</p>
<p>Co-worker on site, for training.</p>
<p>Modem connected.</p>
<p>So, I dialed-up, and telnet-ed in.</p>
<p>I checked it out, everything was working as expected.  Looked just like it had earlier before we shipped it.</p>
<p>About a week later, I received a report that response time was absolutely horrible.  Horrible, unusable.</p>
<p>So, I dialed-up, and telnet-ed in.</p>
<p>Horribly slow.  Even considering I was on dial-up and probably 9600, maybe 19200, it was almost dead at the shell.</p>
<p>I could feel it from 8 timezones away, it was swapping bad.</p>
<p>So, I typed in free, and waited.</p>
<p>Sure enough, half of the ram had disappeared.</p>
<p>And like magic, it was back the next day.</p>
<p>Caught the problem before the ram was sold.</p>

<p>This would guarantee I would receive more views.</p>
<p>But, before I could do this I had to have some coffee.</p>
<p>I like coffee and I always make it black.</p>
<p>So I made some coffee but when I poured it into my cup, it was green!</p>
<p>Now how could I have just made green coffee?</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what, I never did find out.</p>
<p>But&#8230; it was delicious.</p>
<p>So anyway like I was saying&#8230;</p>

				<p>@ Clive, Anders, ALL</p>
<p>If you are curious about vishing, an expert reviewed this incident.</p>
<p>One point that I caught immediately, is always interrupt the target when they are most asleep.</p>
<p>Anyway, read the thread for her insights on social engineering.</p>
<p>hXXps://twitter.com/RachelTobac/status/1341119963650686976</p>
<p>Wow, a 49 min master class on vishing (phone attacking) by @navalny himself to an FSB officer involved in his own attempted nerve agent murder. Excellent work by @bellingcat.</p>

				<p>@SpaceLifeForm @Clive @ALL</p>
<p>To pull this kind of stunt you need to know a lot about the SYSTEM. Navalny knows.</p>
<p>Loyalty to the leaders was something that was part of teaching through all soviet time education &#8211; little octobrists, pioneers, komsomol, party. Obeying without any question, loyalty to the bones. If you didn&#8217;t, best case scenario &#8211; you couldn&#8217;t make a career inside the SYSTEM, you were outcast. Worst case &#8211; GULAG or mental hospital for the rest of the life. But for some persons being the outcast was actually the worst. So they served literally their @$$ off and those kind of persons are very exploitable via social engineering.</p>
<p>But in what KGB/FSB is really master of is exploiting human weaknesses, their worst fears, driving them to the max and putting them to work for them.</p>
<p>KGB/FSB is very closed ecosystem. Whoever enters to this system loses their privacy and &#8220;normal&#8221; life forever. So all they know they are constantly monitored after receiving highest level security clearance. Also there&#8217;s no turning back &#8211; when you do bad things to others you know that the same things can be done to you easily if you don&#8217;t obey &#8211; accident on street, felling out from window etc etc etc. So you obey.</p>
<p>So putting those ingredients together you can actually use them against the SYSTEM as it was done here.</p>

				<p>@ Anders,</p>
<blockquote><p>Loyalty to the leaders was something that was part of teaching through all soviet time education – little octobrists, pioneers, komsomol, party. Obeying without any question, loyalty to the bones.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just like most religions and cults, control of a childs mind gives compliant adults. Something Drug Pushers likewise know all about.</p>
<p>You get the children before they can talk, through their mothers. The men are just there to make more children and provide for them untill it is their turn to feed fresh flesh into the religion / cult.</p>
<p>Stalin and Co just copied the idea from others. For instance Karl Marx said,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation. <b>It is the opium of the people.</b> The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is required for their real happiness. The demand to give up the illusion about its condition is the demand to give up a condition which needs illusions.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Some years later after the Religion of Russia became &#8220;the party&#8221; another writer resident in England wrote two books &#8220;Animal Farm&#8221; and &#8220;1984&#8221; both describe the despotism and tyrany of such authoritarian systems as the perversion communism had become.</p>
<p>When Gorbachev tried to take the opiate of communism out of Russia before it killed the country. The result was like any other body going through the withdrawal process. As some will nodoubt have observed the addict has once again relapsed back into old needle in the arm habits.</p>
<p>The kindest thing any parent can do is ensure their child has no contact with religion or politics untill they are old enough to realise the evil they can and do hide.</p>
<p>There are reasons why we don&#8217;t allow people to vote untill they are 18, likewise we should not alow those under 18 to participate in religion, which realy is just an older form of political control.</p>

<p>I understand your feelings in this. However, every child should find her or his position in society. To be able to do so, it should learn about every relevant aspect of its society. If religion and politics are relevant in its society, it should learn about them.</p>
<p>Parents can only transfer the believes they have. It is inhumane, and impossible in any halfway free society, to force parents to bring up their children in believes not shared by the parents.</p>
<p>The problem here is not so much in the upbringing of the children, but in the dysfunctional nature of their society.</p>
<p>In most countries, politics and religion are not balancing on the brink of civil war. That is the problem that had to be solved by the adults in the affected countries.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been following Bruce&#8217;s blog for many years and have read several of his books.  He maked a giant gaffe by claiming Signal had been compromised then there&#8217;s this nonsense regarding Bellingcat.  I&#8217;ve posted two reasonable posts with supporting articles from excellent sources and my posts never seem to make it to the comments section.  I&#8217;m done with your nonsense and your seemingly new idiocy.  No more recommendations to colleagues, friends or family.  Shame on you for spreading easily verified nonsens.</p>

				<p>Getting back to the story, I got the feeling that Putin and the FSB have just selected the next President of the Russian Federation, Alexey Navalny.</p>
<p>I also realized that at this point in the story, in the Russian folkstories I read as a kid, Ilya Myurometz would take his bow, go around to all the churches, and shoot the gold crosses off their roofs in lieu of unpaid wages, and let the rest of his fellow citizens get drunk on the proceeds of the rest. It can be risky to infuriate a bogatyr.</p>

<p>For reasons you could not explain and only conjour up entirely false reasoning, and false accusations based on your idiotic and entirely incorrect assumptions.</p>

<p>re: <i>Trolls</i></p>
<blockquote><p>A troll is a being in Scandinavian folklore, including Norse mythology. In Old Norse sources, beings described as trolls dwell in isolated rocks, mountains, or caves, live together in small family units, and are rarely helpful to human beings. </p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I think it&#8217;s an AI Bot practicing for the next Turing Test. Giving it some spin around the block is somewhat entertaining. It is certainly working on the part about being &#8220;rarely helpful to human beings&#8221;.  Someone loaded the test deck with a bunch of religious tracts, and being AI, it has mangled most of that into the biased formats promoted by such AI systems.</p>

<p>Quotes are yours:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Sounds plausible. AIs seem to have become very good at simulating monomaniac obsessed trolls.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I love it. But I&#8217;m multimoniacal, fellow human.</p>
<p>And trolls don&#8217;t get the last word. Trolls just take pot-shots, are called out for what they are, and then are defeated utterly.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The internet is awash with religious nonsense from obsessed believers battling each other.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Obsessed with love?<br />
Obsessed with global happiness?<br />
Obsessed with ending all persecutions?<br />
Obsessed with ending hateful ignorance?</p>
<p>Guilty as charged. Except for the &#8220;nonsense&#8221; part.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with peace, love, and understanding?&#8221;<br />
&#8212; Elvis Costello</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The question that remains is, why testing it out here?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Writing practice. Debate practice. Practice in dealing with overly confident buffoons. And because the Spirit has Its own dictates, guiding us to share our love where and when It Wills.</p>
<p>Thanks for your essential contribution to this conversation. I especially appreciate how you inadvertently helped proved my point while being unable to later defend your leader, who has fallen silent. I am also mildly disappointed that you are treating your liberator with disdain.</p>
<p>And now you try to explain away your collective inability to defeat the truth of my logic and understanding by pretending that I&#8217;m an AI. Well, for many if not most, the fantasies of their imagination, however convoluted and implausible, are easier than accepting the truth.</p>
<p>Everyone has the right to choose to believe whatever the hell they want. I suggest you choose the truth, the objective truth. Regardless, I wish you all peace and happiness.</p>
<p>-=-=-<br />
Note that the level of AI tech you suggest can simply not ever happen. No matter how large the computers, they&#8217;re all just word rearrangers in the spirit of Eliza, though now they do a lot of statistical heavy lifting, but that&#8217;s just analysis, not understanding. Understanding will ever be beyond them; that&#8217;s the sole provenance of human wetware.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, proper understanding remains beyond many of my fellow human beings as well, which is well within their rights yet debilitating to their spiritual growth towards our ability to evolve our world society beyond our petty, destructive conflicts. And that&#8217;s our collective problem in a nutshell: people are mostly just looking out for themselves or their fellow pack members, instead of evaluating our &#8220;progress&#8221; in terms of how we affect our ecosystems and all our fellow societies. Oh, the Id/Ego/Soul is a nasty beast when left unchallenged, and &#8212; far worse still &#8212; most people tend to go further and accentuate its nasty tendencies.</p>

				<p>@Obviously:</p>
<p>&#8220;We see where troll feeding leads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately not &#8220;feeding&#8221; makes this troll change food source.</p>
<p>And in this case has clearly stated it has no intention of stopping with,</p>
<p>&#8220;And trolls don’t get the last word.&#8221;</p>
<p>But something else about it&#8217;s behaviour that should be noted, bessides trying to bully others.</p>
<p>Note it assumes that the family name &#8220;Schneier&#8221; means that Bruce is either Jewish or sympathetic to Jewish culture and customs therefor can be manipulated by them. Thus the troll frames a pointless argument point around customs and practices of Jewish law.</p>
<p>Such an obvious tactic is embarrassing to watch and in reality will probably backfire.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for both @Bruce and @Moderator, because it&#8217;s obviousness will be observed by all thus @Bruce and @Moderators impartiality will be called into question by those with their own troll like behaviours as,we see already from time to time. So if they let it go, it will cause problems now. but if they hammer down on the troll it will cause them future problems from other trolls as well. So damed if they do and damed if they don&#8217;t, not a nice place to be, and it looks like the troll is not going to stop making it worse for them.</p>
<p>@rrd (The troll in question):</p>
<p>The things you mention are actually jewish law &#8220;comming of age&#8221; rituals and similar thus they are by definition not children any more. So it&#8217;s exactly the same reason children are not alowed to vote untill they have reached a legal age&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_and_bat_mitzvah" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_and_bat_mitzvah</a></p>
<p>A point @xcv has made to you with,</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a Yiddish term for something that is by no means exclusively Jewish.&#8221;</p>
<p>So you might want to &#8220;face-palm&#8221; or just hang your head, as you have actually provided an example in oppostion to your own argument&#8230;</p>
<p>An argument by the way you could only have started by quite deliberatly &#8220;taking out of context&#8221; -as pointed out by numerous others- a statment made by &#8220;Clive Robinson&#8221; of,</p>
<p>&#8220;There are reasons why we don’t allow people to vote untill they are 18, likewise we should not alow those under 18 to participate in religion, which realy is just an older form of political control.&#8221;</p>
<p>You might want to look up the age the US thinks you cease to be regarded as a child in law.</p>
<p>Oh and just for &#8220;shits and giggles&#8221; another example to &#8220;nail down the lid&#8221; on what many more now see as your quite deliberate &#8220;bad faith&#8221; argument,</p>
<p>In Western Christianity there is the &#8220;Confirmation&#8221; this practice is usually followed when adults are baptized, ordinarily by a bishop, and only when no longer considered a child. That is the child has reached &#8220;the age of reason&#8221; usually some time towards the end of adolescence. As I know Catholics who practice teen-aged confirmation, see the practice as very much as a &#8220;coming of age&#8221; or &#8220;available for marriage&#8221; rite/ritual (thus teenage pregnancy which some would regard as child explotation). Also in times past Confirmation had both legal and political implications not just under &#8220;Church Law&#8221; but &#8220;Civil Law&#8221; as handed down by Kings and occasionaly Queens and in these days despots, tyrants, dictators and other politicians, to exert yet another control on the populous. After all why do you think the founding fathers insisted on a seperation between Church and State?</p>
<p>But importantly those that are not &#8220;Confirmed&#8221; are &#8220;not alowed to participate&#8221; in the very basis of christian religious practices of partaking of the wine and bread that represent the blood and the body of Christ that washes away all sins (The Eucharist) likewise &#8220;Confession&#8221;. Because children are pressumed to be free of the responsability of thought thus original sin, that came about through the writings of Augustine of Hippo and earlier philosophers and theologians,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/znqck2p/revision/4" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/znqck2p/revision/4</a></p>
<p>So your knowledge on religion is looking to be quite parochial&#8230; Ammusingly a term you might not understand because &#8220;you are parochial&#8221;, it comes from the notion of a religious &#8220;parish&#8221; being small and usually inwards focused, so from Wikipedia,</p>
<p>&#8220;Parochialism is the state of mind, whereby one focuses on small sections of an issue rather than considering its wider context. More generally, it consists of being narrow in scope. In that respect, it is a synonym of &#8220;provincialism&#8221;. It may, particularly when used pejoratively, be contrasted to universalism. The term insularity (related to an island) may be similarly used.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parochialism" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parochialism</a></p>
<p>The immportant point for you to note is,</p>
<p>&#8220;contrasted to universalism&#8221;</p>
<p>In your outpourings that are trite at best and devoid of practical meaning you claim &#8220;universalism&#8221; that you very clearly do not possess with,</p>
<p>&#8220;And because the Spirit has Its own dictates, guiding us to share our love where and when It Wills.&#8221;</p>
<p>But further fun is to be had,</p>
<p>&#8220;But I’m multimoniacal&#8221;</p>
<p>Multimoniacal is an interesting word usage. Do you know how often it comes up in an Internet search including all those extensive US English dictionaries?</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t spoil the fun, I&#8217;ll let others try and find it and draw their own conclusions.</p>
<p>Oh and if I remember correctly &#8220;Clive Robinson&#8221; has mentioned on this blog before he has a DD (Doctorate of Divinity) that he does not use, something you might want to consider.</p>
<p>Therefore I for one see rather more than the smell of singed sock from powder burns in your vicinity in the near future, so a blessing much in your style, but first to quote you,</p>
<p>&#8220;trolls don’t get the last word. Trolls just take pot-shots, are called out for what they are, and then are defeated utterly.&#8221;</p>
<p>So onto the blessing,</p>
<p>&#8220;May you be a happy looser&#8221;.</p>

<p>re: <i>why test an AI Bot here?</i></p>
<p>Oh, loads of reasons.</p>
<p>1, We don&#8217;t know that they are not testing it elsewhere with a different filter settings.</p>
<p>2, This is a no-captcha type posting system.  So dump a load and hit the next target.<br />
I see this in MMORPG games too.  Many games have a trial or free-to-play option, so the spam systems register a bunch and then hit fast before they are locked out. Even with a delay-to-post timer, with multiple accounts they can swing between accounts and server-shards before the door is slammed.</p>
<p>3, We are a good testing site. If the AI-Bot ever actually made sense beyond stupid, our August-Selves would respond in kind.  That would mean it would win the next Turing Test event &#8211; probably at high school level now.</p>
<p>4, The AI test deck isn&#8217;t getting any brighter, because of how AI-ML works, the data levels decrease to smaller and smaller subsets, in an attempt at refinement.<br />
If you compare earlier dumploads to the more recent dumploads, it&#8217;s far below previous levels of content stringing.  Indicating the refinement winnowing process.</p>
<p>5, The AI test deck is repetitive. It probably wasn&#8217;t designed with too much to begin with. A dumpster load of religious material easily obtained electronically.  Another dumpster load of quotations, prolly scrapped from wikiquote or a like site.  When the parsing rules fall thru the response sieve, if it doesn&#8217;t find a ranked hot-topic-key-word it falls into quotations.<br />
When a human makes a reference, they normally connect it to a specific topic. AI does not work with indirect references so picks something from the pot.</p>

<p>It is quite trivial to get the comment post url and drop payload without any browser automation through a simple POST request and web scraping.</p>
<p>But I think its a human probably from India, who acts like a robot enslaved to his own assumptions.</p>

				<p>@Winter:</p>
<p>&#8220;why test an AI Bot here?&#8221;</p>

<p>@Obviously:</p>
<p>&#8220;Multimoniacal is an interesting word usage.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not coming up on my search radar, is it even a real word?</p>
<p>The nearest I get for a root word is from,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/maniacal" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/maniacal</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Maniacal definition is &#8211; affected with or suggestive of madness.&#8221;</p>
<p>The root word of which is maniac</p>
<p>&#8220;The noun maniac is almost always used to describe people who do nutty things—serial killers, insane people on the street&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>So would multi-maniacal be multiple mad personalities in a single person?</p>
<p>Not so much a &#8220;nut&#8221; singluar but the whole &#8220;nut tree&#8221; thus nuts plural.</p>

				<p>@Obviously So</p>
<p>It has seemed to me that when not addressed, he goes silent for a time. When asked about something he said, or criticized, he goes on offense.</p>
<p>Not responding would minimize his posts, and most importantly, save posters a lot of time coming up with arguments that will never be understood, and will only lead to more arguments.</p>

				<p>@Obviously:</p>
<p>&#8220;When asked about something he said, or criticized, he goes on offense.&#8221;</p>
<p>That would be easy to ignore if it were not for the fact many of his criticisms are actually personal attacks, using unfounded accusations in a quite obvious attack on the the various individuals to denigrate them in other readers eyes.</p>
<p>For instance his accusations of being Fascist or Fascist sympathisers or antisemetic or other &#8220;dog whistle&#8221; type attacks just on this page alone. If the @moderator diligently deleated them then it would not be as bad but some have stayed up in the past for more than a week, which is harmfull to the innocent individual targeted.</p>
<p>As can be seen he thinks this has in effect made him invincible thus has emboldened him to worse accusations.</p>
<p>What his actual intentions are is unclear, but &#8220;collecting trophy scalps&#8221; appears to be very much part of it.</p>
<p>Whilst he very occasionaly does make a vaguely security related post by far the majority are not. This is still against the spirit of the posting rules and others have been banned for considerably less in the past</p>
<p>On balance if he is ignored I do not think he will stop he will just move on to attacking other frequent posters, as can be seen on this thread. Apparently using &#8220;a fling enough mud and some will stick&#8221; attack methodology.</p>
<p>This tends to suggest the real target is this blog or the blogs host, and lets face it there are enough &#8220;right wing&#8221; types that come and make attacks against this blogs host to say that is a credible point.</p>
<p>He claims all sorts of religious mumbo-jumbo but actually has no real knowledge and is either truly ignorant or to lazy to learn enough to play a good bigot.</p>
<p>Further he has no debating skills and is very much ignorant of basic terms and gambits, suggesting again no basic knowledge or ability and so regularly shoots himself in the foot you would think he had no toes left by now.</p>
<p>For old hands his behaviour is reminiscent of &#8220;he who should not be named&#8221; who was very much an outsider pretending to be an insider and doing it so badly it was embarrassing to all.</p>
<p>Any way others have made analyses of his mentality etc so I&#8217;m not going to dogpile any further.</p>

				<p>onKnowsNothing @Obviously So</p>
<p>Yes, good points. Some of my comments which served only to call attention to logical weaknesses in his posts were met with the most idiotic profanity-filled attacks and then deleted. And so it’s easy to see how one given to feelings of grandiosity will feel that license has been granted to him.</p>
<p>In re: the AI question:<br />
In a comment that was rather quickly deleted, not sure why—and I’m sorry if I overstepped boundaries— I said that the troll in question is functionally a bot. My reasoning is based on having had the personal experience of knowing a guy who seemed to be developing “issues” that over a period of years kept getting worse.</p>
<p>As time went on, that guy began to sound just like the troll under consideration here now sounds. Grandiosity (e.g. the the Instant Expert status achieved after half-reading a magazine article) came to be as frequently on display as surprising ignorance, which he combined with poor impulse control in verbal output and bullying behavior. It was in time clear that he would not be able to pass a Turing Test, so fixated had he become on certain ideas and rage triggers. It was a sad story, the guy lost his marriage, tore his family apart, lost nearly all his friends.</p>
<p>The considerations for security are real. The divisional director who had hired the guy never forgot the “worst decision” of his career. The degradation of organizational function caused by that one guy would have been a worthy study. (They were finally able to put him out to pasture.)</p>
<p>And here we have a troll who has wasted many, many hours of community members’ time with his antics which aim, he says, at improving his writing and debating skills. And just yesterday on the Friday Squid, in a comment that seems to have been deleted, someone was helping him with some high school biology (the response remains):</p>

				<p>@ WmG</p>
<p>You said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The noise he produces degrades the quality of this blog. And gives a poor impression to everyone who visits.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, you say this as an anti-religious zealot (Clive) &#8212; who openly admits that some powerful &#8220;we&#8221; should be able to end the Jewish practice of the Bar/Bat Mitzvah &#8212; is perfectly with you.</p>
<p>You are trying to defend the indefensible. And you folks keep creeping out of the woodwork to take your meaningless potshots.</p>
<p>James Baldwin stated it so very well :</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There are so many ways of being despicable it quite makes one’s head spin. But the way to be really despicable is to be contemptuous of other people’s pain.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And you are indifferent to the pain Clive and his royal &#8220;we&#8221; would inflict upon literally billions of people.</p>
<p>Anyone unrepentantly expressing the views he has has said all they need to say about themselves. And you are saying all you need to say about yourself here, as well.</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I don’t believe that I am qualified to set the terms under which other people raise their kids, whether they are Hindi, atheist, Sikh, agnostic, Jewish, or other.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While CLive said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There are reasons why we don’t allow people to vote untill they are 18, likewise we should not alow those under 18 to participate in religion, which realy is just an older form of political control.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I can only imagine, but it seems likely that Bruce Schneier&#8217;s being a fellow at Harvard University may have put him into close contact with some very fine folks of not just Jewish parentage, but Jewish heritage, which is &#8212; at its best &#8212; as noble a heritage as exists on Earth.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re fine with Clive&#8217;s idea? Gaslighting me is the surest way to demonstrate your dispicable allegience.</p>
<p>Thanks again for joining the group so eager to tell us who they are.</p>
<p>Another James Baldwin quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Incontestably, alas, most people are not, in action, worth very much; and yet, every human being is an unprecedented miracle. One tries to treat them as the miracles they are, while trying to protect oneself against the disasters they’ve become.”
</p></blockquote>

				<p>Someone asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Why don’t you answer that question?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, I did.</p>
<p>And I correctly predicted that Clive wouldn&#8217;t answer my question of him.</p>
<p>But he did. He absolutely did. As clear as a bell. But not in words, only in his choosing to continue to ignore it.</p>
<p>-=-=-<br />
A DD who believes God is a figment of the human imagination? Absurd.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m not surprised, but, regardless, money can&#8217;t buy dignity, honor, honesty, or Wisdom.</p>
<p>Saying one has those qualities is a helluva lot easier than actually doing the hard graft of achieving them.</p>
<p>It helps to know that we are literally figments of God&#8217;s imagination, but no one in this crowd wants those pearls.</p>
<p>Thanks for the inspiration and motivation, all.</p>

				<p>Thank you very little for wafting the smell back up in front of everyone after a few days of inactivity.</p>
<p>While Clive&#8217;s perspective certainly does stink, I suggest the truth of his perfidy to humanity, commenting tactics, and hypocrisies remain here for all to see. It really is a testament to modern inhumanity.</p>
<p>Now I wonder who would wait a few days and then request a clean-up? Two of the three factors of criminal investigative work are motive and opportunity, neh?</p>
<p>Trump was known for calling into radio shows as &#8220;John Barron&#8221;. Such moves would likely be even easier on Bruce&#8217;s blog, yet probably provide more information than just handle to use in analyzing the probability of whether or not a given set of comments come from the same computer.</p>
<p>Obvious, indeed.</p>

I'm a fellow and lecturer at Harvard's <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/bruce-schneier">Kennedy School</a>, a board member of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and the Chief of Security Architecture at <a href="https://inrupt.com/">Inrupt, Inc.</a> This personal website expresses the opinions of none of those organizations.</p>
