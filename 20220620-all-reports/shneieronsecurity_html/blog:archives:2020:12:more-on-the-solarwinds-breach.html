		<h2 class="entry">More on the SolarWinds Breach</h2>
		<p>The <i>New York Times</i> has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/us/politics/russia-hack-nsa-homeland-security-pentagon.html">more details</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>About 18,000 private and government users downloaded a Russian tainted software update &#8211;­ a Trojan horse of sorts ­&#8211; that gave its hackers a foothold into victims&#8217; systems, according to SolarWinds, the company whose software was compromised.</p>
<p>Among those who use SolarWinds software are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the State Department, the Justice Department, parts of the Pentagon and a number of utility companies. While the presence of the software is not by itself evidence that each network was compromised and information was stolen, investigators spent Monday trying to understand the extent of the damage in what could be a significant loss of American data to a foreign attacker.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that the SVR (a successor to the KGB) penetrated all of those networks. But it is likely that they penetrated many of the important ones. And that they have buried themselves into those networks, giving them persistent access even if this vulnerability is patched. This is a massive intelligence coup for the Russians and failure for the Americans, even if no classified networks were touched.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CISA has <a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/">directed</a> everyone to remove SolarWinds from their networks. This is (1) too late to matter, and (2) likely to take many months to complete. Probably the right answer, though.</p>
<p>This is almost <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/global-cyber-solarwinds/hackers-at-center-of-sprawling-spy-campaign-turned-solarwinds-dominance-against-it-idUSKBN28P2N8">too stupid to believe</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In one previously unreported issue, multiple criminals have offered to sell access to SolarWinds&#8217; computers through underground forums, according to two researchers who separately had access to those forums.</p>
<p>One of those offering claimed access over the Exploit forum in 2017 was known as &#8220;fxmsp&#8221; and is wanted by the FBI &#8220;for involvement in several high-profile incidents,&#8221; said Mark Arena, chief executive of cybercrime intelligence firm Intel471. Arena informed his company&#8217;s clients, which include U.S. law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>Security researcher Vinoth Kumar told Reuters that, last year, he alerted the company that anyone could access SolarWinds&#8217; update server by using the password &#8220;solarwinds123&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This could have been done by any attacker, easily,&#8221; Kumar said.</p>
<p>Neither the password nor the stolen access is considered the most likely source of the current intrusion, researchers said.</p></blockquote>
<p>That last sentence is important, yes. But the sloppy security practice is likely not an isolated incident, and speaks to the overall lack of security culture at the company.</p>
<p>And I noticed that SolarWinds has <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/company/customers">removed its customer page</a>, presumably as part of its damage control efforts. I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/12/another-massive-russian-hack-of-us-government-networks.html">quoted from it</a>. Did anyone save a copy?</p>
<p>EDITED TO ADD: Both the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201214143046/https://www.solarwinds.com/company/customers">Wayback Machine</a> and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/12/u-s-treasury-commerce-depts-hacked-through-solarwinds-compromise/">Brian Krebs</a> have saved the SolarWinds customer page.</p>

<p>re:<i>Wayback Machine as archive </i></p>
<p>fwiw: Do not rely on the WBM as a persistent safe source of archive material.  The WBM can and does delete information regularly and there are lots of conditions where the archive is required to do so.</p>
<p>If you find something of interest &#8211; make a copy if that&#8217;s safe for you to do so.  Sometimes it is not safe depending on the context of the page.</p>
<p>What is definitely not safe, is to believe the WBM holds all archives of the entire internet for ever and ever. (1) It doesn&#8217;t and cannot.<br />
&emsp;</p>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<p>1, A multiple lifetime storage system is in Bluffdale UT owned by the NSA.  One might expect that there are similar archives owned by other like minded groups.</p>

				<p>@ ALL,</p>
<p>Please note that neither FireEye who first broke the news nor Volexity say &#8220;Russian&#8221; they are both at pains to distance themselves currently.</p>
<p>Thus I&#8217;d keep a careful eye on this it may well turn out to be a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>If you look you will see that the claims do not indicate it is APT28 or APT29 as there is no similarity or tracability in the tools and techniques used by the attackers. So far they appear to be novel to &#8220;Dark Halo&#8221;.</p>
<p>The problem is that it appears to be way to many novel tools and techniques at one time, and levels of sophistication above that of quite a few Nation State (Level III) actors.</p>
<p>Which might mean that either they have been around for some time unnoticed or they aquired tools and techniques from others that have been unnoticed for some time.</p>
<p>It has in the past been suggested that US AV companies remove detection for attacks they believe to be from the likes of the Five Eyes SigInt agencies&#8230; Thus the tools and techniques might have originated from these organisations.</p>
<p>Some have even suggested that what has been exploited was another &#8220;backdoor&#8221; not to disimilar in idea to those found in RSA and Jupiter products. However such SigInt tools and techniques were very much more subtle than what has happened to SolarWinds. In fact the &#8220;backdoor&#8221; so far described is more like the sort of thing the FBI has been getting Universities to build for them to attack TOR users or with the assistance of the DoJ try and force equipment suppliers like Apple to install using archaic laws.</p>
<p>Much of the sophistication claimed for &#8220;Dark Halo&#8221; is predicated on the fact that these attackers are &#8220;external actors&#8221; from begining to end.</p>
<p>However if instead you assume they only found and used a preexisting backdoor then their attack becomes much more believable. Hence their reason togo after the FireEye Red Team Tools. Which they would surely not need if they were as sophisticated as some have indicated.</p>
<p>Either way we have a puzzle here and many of the pieces are missing and it&#8217;s going to become more intriguing with time&#8230; Speaking of which,</p>
<p>Then there is the behaviour of major investors &#8220;bailing&#8221; by what is probably &#8220;insider trading&#8221; why would they do that and in effect take a loss? I guess they are not going to say and will use any leverage they have at hand to kill any prosecution before it starts. So it&#8217;s worth keeping an eye on them as well.</p>
<p>So keep your ears abd eyes open and the popcorn on the go, this story has the feeling it&#8217;s going to get some very interesting legs real soon.</p>

<p>It is important to observe that the WBM page archive is just a <b>very small subset</b> of the SolarWinds clients.</p>

				<p>@ Clive, JonKnowsNothing, ALL</p>
<p>Note:  FTP Upload access does not mean that the source code magically made it into the build system.</p>
<p>That would require an inside job.</p>
<p>Unless, owned for a long time.</p>
<p>And software was in place to detect new upload, insert into SCM, and remove from FTP folder.</p>
<p>This is not trivial.</p>
<p>And it also would require a worthless POS SCM/Build System that has no tracking, no signoffs.</p>
<p>Everything points to inside job.</p>

				<p>@SpaceLifeForm</p>
<p>re:<i>magic in the  build</i></p>
<p>I can think of several ways source code can be added to a build system and no one would notice.</p>
<p>One way is when there are several devs working on the same project. Source can be added and everyone else presumes it&#8217;s the other dudettes code.  As long as the merge is seamless and doesn&#8217;t crack up another hunk the code would be added to the build.</p>
<p>This presumes that the attacker can access the source base and run compiles to be sure nothing cracks but it would leave the code behind to read.</p>
<p>The other option is to get an obj file into the linker pool.  A good number of builds only rebuild new code to reduce build time.  If the obj were a separate file then it would be reviewable if noticed.  However, if the  bad-obj was merged or linked to a good-non-changing obj it could be unnoticed for a long time.</p>
<p>As to Source Control Systems &#8211; Back when most were company hosted, there were some not that good and charged mega $$$. Some years ago I had an encounter with such a beast. Surprising given the nature of the development not even passwords or branch restrictions &#8211; just tarball up the entire source code for a mega-mega-mega corporation.  One might hope they changed it but I wasn&#8217;t holding my breath at the time. No one on the project saw the least teeny bit of a problem and the devs didn&#8217;t want any more restrictions or validations.</p>
<p>If the insider-access started in that time frame, it would have been ezpz to do.</p>
<p>The interesting aspect is: there are no obvious traces&#8230;</p>

<p>Go back here, and follow the reversing link.<br />
They checked the metadata available, and no evidence of any prior build binaries.</p>
<p>It was a fresh build from source, immediately signed.</p>
<p>Source code just laying around should never get magically sucked into the build process.</p>
<p>Never.</p>

<p>No friction at all. You have to login in now to see the support page, but the following quote still brings up the page in search results.</p>
<p>&#8220;To run SolarWinds products more efficiently, you may need to exclude certain files, directories and ports from anti-virus protection and GPO restrictions.&#8221;</p>
<p>hxxps://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Files-and-directories-to-exclude-from-antivirus-scanning-for-Orion-Platform-products?language=en_US</p>
<p>&#8220;We also list the service accounts that should be added for optimal performance and to allow all Orion products to access to required files with required permissions.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a stroke of genius, worth every cent. This is what makes the whole &#8216;backdoor&#8217; and &#8216;ghost user&#8217; encryption advice from government lawyers, with absolutely no security training or interest, so brilliant. If you can&#8217;t see it, and you don&#8217;t know about it, it didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buy our radium , it will cure anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The more than 800 charges laid and children rescued in the following investigation was due to a lot of painstaking work. Investigations take years of work, and a willingness to make them happen. It is the willingness that is the greatest problem, and there are no magic fixes that will let anyone escape that.</p>

				<p>The most frustrating thing is the lack of accountability. The political spin that attacks are sophisticated, is nothing more than an attempt to disguise the fact that legislation to secure government systems has been stalled in the house for close to a decade. Instead of anything useful, it has instead turned into a partisan farce, that must have the adversaries of the United States rolling on the floor laughing.</p>
<p>Even when an act manages to pass, you still have to get departments in each and every state to implement basic security requirements.<br />
If you read audits from state agencies from nations around the world who have managed to enact legislation, the state of cybersecurity in most state departments is appalling. The audits are often the same year after year.<br />
No auditing, worst ever passwords, missing logs&#8230;</p>
<p>A hacker does not need an IQ of 197 and 15% of your password, a low to average IQ is quite enough if they can guess your password, and there is no auditing.</p>
<p>I have read department cybersecurity audits for years and thought to myself &#8220;my @#$%ing God, my @#$%ing God, why are things not way way worse already&#8221;, and &#8220;holy @#$%ing 5-it, holy @#$%ing 5-it&#8221;. (because they are and nobody knows because of the lack of proper auditing)</p>
<p>You wonder to yourself why you even bothered preparing and submitting assessments, and reporting security vulnerabilities when they are just left unfixed and exploitable a year later. Then you remember that one rather large corporation changed the FTP credentials that one time many years ago, perhaps it&#8217;s possible again. Perhaps you don&#8217;t have to knock over a server and bring down an entire network to get someone to fix something.</p>
<p>&#8230;Perhaps the support staff are not technically illiterate, completely overconfident, and won&#8217;t open an attachment that says &#8220;password protected, DO NOT OPEN on the network&#8221;.</p>
<p>Maybe someone will listen to the administrator. Maybe the administrator won&#8217;t shoot themselves after a prolonged and severe breakdown.</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm, JonKnowsNothing, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>It is important to observe that the WBM page archive is just a very small subset of the SolarWinds clients.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are various figures floating around. As far as I can tell the important ones are,</p>
<p>300,000 Customers.<br />
18,000 Downloaded the backdoor.<br />
~100 Select customers attacked.</p>
<p>With atleast one report indicating 180k rather than 18k having downloaded the backdoor.</p>
<p>If the 300,000 customers is true, then it is likely that is &#8220;world wide customers&#8221;. If the 18,000 downloaded is true that is actually very surprisingly small. That is at only 6% of customers you would have to ask &#8220;Why so few?&#8221;, 60% would be more likely unless there was a mechanism somewhere that &#8220;selected&#8221; who did and did not get the &#8220;backdoor&#8221;.</p>
<p>Just explaining this discrepancy alone might reveal some major implications, but also tells you just how little information we have publically[1].</p>
<p>I get the feeling many want the public to just swallow the &#8220;It&#8217;s wot Russkies dun&#8221; line so they can hide one heck of a pile of nastyness out of sight ubder the corner of the rug.</p>
<p>I suspect it&#8217;s going to take some time to get to the truth of the matter, and I don&#8217;t think people are going to like the truth, so it&#8217;s showing all the signs of something that is going to be kicked very hard into the long grass with a good downhill slope to keep it rolling away far far out of sight&#8230;</p>
<p>[1] publicly / publically, both are correct but which to use?</p>

<blockquote><p>Note: FTP Upload access does not mean that the source code magically made it into the build system.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, but more importantly it&#8217;s also true of the other end of the chain. That is uploading an executable/interpreted code file does not mean it will be downloaded and run by a client machine.</p>
<p>It would need access to a lot more than just the code signing key&#8230;</p>
<p>For either of these things a lot would have to be wrong with SolarWinds development, test, maintainence etc processes, seriously wrong&#8230; Or a sufficiently high level person in SolarWinds Development managment being in the know and shuffling things through and keeping a lid on any internal questions arising.</p>
<p>The questions that investigators should be asking are effectively &#8220;Which?&#8221; and &#8220;Why?&#8221;. And you can bet your bottom dollar it&#8217;s not just Venture Capitalists that &#8220;Want to be the heck out of Dodge&#8221; before anyone asks those questions.</p>

				<p>No manufacturers of voting machines in the list by Brian Krebs, fortunately.</p>
<p>I was just wondering whether the surprisingly wide support to the trumpist ideas in the elections was not a surprise after all. In Europe there is widespread suspicion whether US can be relied on as a long-term ally, if there is a large fraction of voting populace wishing to re-play the previous four years. It would be beneficial to many adversaries of the US to widen the gap.</p>
<p>It seems voting machines were not affected, after all. Many of those don&#8217;t leave a paper trail, unlike postal voting which does.</p>

				<p>@ResearcherZero &#8211; in the reply to John Carter</p>
<p>Regarding the link to SolarWinds recommended exclusions &#8211; I see the problem with the company in the path.  They apparently refer to their support group as the &#8220;Success Center&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked too many years now as a System Administrator and I really shudder when I see that a company I deal with has changed the name for the support group to some sort of &#8220;success center&#8221;.  Generally the change seems to imply that more emphasis will be placed on &#8220;feel good&#8221; activity over providing real support.  Customer Success Centers should be viewed as a reason to pass over a company for consideration, in my opinion.  (Don&#8217;t even get me started on training videos taking the place of real documentation!  🙂  )</p>
<p>I tried to visit the link, but like most &#8220;modern&#8221; wesites, nothing at all was displayed without java script.  Considering the recent activity I decided it was best to not allow any of it.</p>

				<p>Key concepts straight out of <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/News-Features/Feature-Stories/Article-View/Article/2451159/nsa-cybersecurity-advisory-malicious-actors-abuse-authentication-mechanisms-to/" rel="nofollow ugc">NSA&#8217;s press release</a> &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8230; This advisory provides guidance to National Security System (NSS), Department of Defense (DoD), and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) network administrators to detect and mitigate against malicious cyber actors who are manipulating trust in <strong>federated authentication environments to access protected data in the cloud</strong>. It builds on the guidance shared in the cybersecurity advisory regarding VMware with state-sponsored actors exploiting CVE 2020-4006 and forging credentials to access protected files, though other nation states and cyber criminals may use this <strong>tactic, technique, and procedure (TTP)</strong> as well. &#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Government employees are lazy and entrenched behind their desks at work at the NSA, and while they speak in a low whisper, the truth is that they relly aren&#8217;t much better at keeping secrets than any other government agency with a communal office environment given to “the usual” infighting, backstabbing, gossiping, chit-chat, and office politics, not to mention the Title IX sexual harassment lawsuit jackpots with the requisite “hostile work environment” and the classified information charges against Reality Winner.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/" rel="nofollow ugc">Kerberos: The Network Authentication Protocol</a> of course is one such “federated authentication environment”, probably the one we are most familiar with in the FOSS world.</p>
<p>The phrase “Tactic, Technique, and Procedure” is probably a press-room misreading of the common acronym “TTP” for <strong>Trusted Third Party</strong> which in all likelihood is really what they are talking about in the context of a “federated authentication environment.”</p>

<p>Weapons system technology is all well and good, but it doesn&#8217;t do anything to fix our terminally broken unconstitutional system of punishment and debt collection without due process, such as it exists in the United States, from SCOTUS on down, without defense, without recourse, without redress, and without possibility of appeal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Democrats are intent on throwing out the baby with the bathwater in Russia, even as they got away with foul play in the U.S. court system. That is unnecessary. Various factions in Russia do present a threat, but it&#8217;s the old-guard hard-line Communist Party threat from the days of the KGB before it became known as the FSB &#8212; Russia has a lot of internal conflict, and America will have to continue cooperating with the friendlier parties, groups, organizations, and individuals there.</p>

Produce  ripples in laminar flows<br />
Accessing  data streaming in torrents<br />
Provoking ire and coming to blows.</p>
