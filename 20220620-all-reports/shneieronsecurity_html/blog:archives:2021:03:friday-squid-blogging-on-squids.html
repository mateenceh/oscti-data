		<h2 class="entry">Friday Squid Blogging: On SQUIDS</h2>
		<p>A good <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/a-curious-observers-guide-to-quantum-mechanics-pt-7-the-quantum-century/2/">tutorial</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But we can go beyond the polarization of electrons and really leverage the electron waviness. By interleaving thin layers of superconducting and normal materials, we can make the quantum electronic equivalents of transistors and diodes such as Superconducting Tunnel Junctions (SJTs) and Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (affectionately known as SQUIDs). These devices take full advantage of the wave-like nature of electrons and can be used as building blocks for all sorts of novel electronics.</p>
<p>Because of the superconducting requirement, they need to be kept very cold, but quantum electronics have already revolutionized precision measurement. The most visible application has been in measuring the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Observations of the CMB have shown that we live in an expanding Universe, determined the age of our Universe, and identified the fraction of it composed of dark matter and dark energy. Measurements of the CMB have transformed our understanding of the Universe we live in. These measurements have been largely enabled by SQUIDs and related superconducting electronics in their microwave cameras. </p></blockquote>
<p>As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.</p>

<p>They apparently have concluded it was an UPS that went south.</p>
<p>I agree, a lot of damage for an environment that should not have that much burnable material.  No HALON type of fire suppression system?</p>
<p>I have not seen the HCF instruction ruled out.</p>

<blockquote><p>I still can’t understand how can datacenter burn like this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ordinary plastic cables are just &#8220;Petro-chemicals&#8221; unless &#8220;plenum rated&#8221; but even those are &#8220;fire retardant&#8221; not &#8220;fire proof&#8221;. Fire proof cables are usually made of mineral oxides inside but still have an outer petro-chem covering. The mineral oxides have a very vairiable dielectric strength so do not make very good EM Transmission Lines that you realy need for Cat 2 and above signalling.</p>
<p>However the thing about &#8220;fire retardants&#8221; is they are not particularly chemically stable so you want to put the minimum required into your petro-chem plastic insulation to stop it breaking down in various ways. So with the limited amounts used the fire retardant properties only work local to the cable and at lower temoratures&#8230; So you get &#8220;a hot chimney effect fire&#8221; then not just the cable insulation but some of the wire it&#8217;s self might burn like an oxy-cutter.</p>
<p>As for Halon Gas &#8220;dump systems&#8221;, sorry folks the Halons are flurinated greenhouse gases that in Europe (of which France is still part of) have  been successively baned by various directives since 1987 and were finally axed except in certain very rare cases in 2003. You are not alowed to make them or replace them so once used you have to find a replacement&#8230;</p>
<p>But appart from being &#8220;super ozone hole makers&#8221; they are a health hazard. For instance you can &#8220;dry drown / suffocate&#8221; in them. Being heavier than air they can fill your lungs displacing oxygen etc at which point you keel over because you&#8217;ve passed out. The gas from a Halon 1301 Dump System forms about a two foot depth on the floor of the room or chamber that when you&#8217;ve passed out you will probably end up with your head in, which gives you about 3mins before brain death starts occurring&#8230; Which is generaly considered something to avoid if you can.</p>
<p>Halon&#8217;s also have some other not so fun side effects,</p>
<p><a href="http://spectrumfx.net/blog/the-multiple-dangers-of-halon" rel="nofollow ugc">http://spectrumfx.net/blog/the-multiple-dangers-of-halon</a></p>
<p>And some people think that they can reduce fertility as well :-S</p>

				<p>@Anders @SpaceLifeForm @Clive @All</p>
<p>The picture of the melted cladding looks a lot like the melted cladding on the Grenfell Tower.</p>
<p>The fight over the flammable cladding is still on-going. There are many buildings, in the UK, EU and other countries still using the same cladding.</p>
<p>A thorny issue and devastating to the current property owners, is the retro-fit cost of changing the cladding.  In some cases the property developers deliberately chose the flammable cladding over the proper cladding in order to save on construction costs.</p>
<p>The banks, financial institutions have all pulled out of lending on these buildings and the current owners are expected to foot the bills.  Costs per owner range from £10,000 to £30,000 and up.  Since the banks have stopped lending, the majority of people do not have £30,000 in pocket change to pony up.</p>
<p>The builders delay repairs via the court systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>December 2020 saw the first case of a leaseholder being bankrupted by costs associated with the crisis</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar cladding was in use in Germany.</p>
<p>ht tps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenfell_Tower_fire</p>
<ul>
<li>On 14 June 2017, a fire broke out in the 24-storey Grenfell Tower block of flats in North Kensington, West London, at 00:54 BST; it caused 72 deaths, including those of two victims who later died in hospital. More than 70 others were injured and 223 people escaped.</li>

<p>That’s not cladding.  It is a Modular data center.  Stacked shipping containers.  It became the rage 10 years ago around the same time as submarine data centers.</p>
<p>The cryptos must make it real hot in there.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_data_center" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_data_center</a></p>
<p>The problem with most data centers is that the fire suppression is often too reactive.</p>

				<p>According to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/ransomware-gangs-hijack-7000-exchange-servers-first-hit-by-chinese-hackers/" title="We have detected and are now blocking a new family of ransomware being used after an initial compromise of unpatched on-premises Exchange Servers." rel="nofollow ugc">this article</a>, exchange servers previously infected by hackers attributed to China are now being infected with ransomware.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Security firm Kryptos Logic said Friday afternoon that it has detected Hafnium-compromised Exchange servers that were later infected with ransomware.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently, the webshells that are installed leave the Exchange servers wide open to a subsequent infection.</p>

				<p>Could it be that the patch was the exploit?</p>
<p>Perhaps the solution is to use Obama’s kill switch.  Give Government and the private sector time to figure it out.</p>

<p>Cut off the USA off from the rest of the world for a few days at least.  We shut down the world for 2 weeks of Christmas and much of August so the interruption will be recoverable whereas the alternative will not be.</p>
<p>Does anyone feel comfortable leaving this in Microsoft’s hands?</p>

				<p>89 CVE’s in one patch.  That has to be making anyone nervous.<br />

<p>It is causing BSOD.  Cannot print.  Some customers, like banks, retailers, airlines and hospitals cannot function without printing.  I wouldn’t install a patch containing that many fixes at once.  Too high risk.  They should have just released a patch with the 4 critical fixes.  That would be more acceptable.</p>

<p>The way this is being handled is so unacceptable.   If a CEO stays quiet in a crisis it’s for self preservation. If he was doing right by their customer the CEO would be releasing statements and videos.  He’s frequently tweeting but nothing at all ever about these attacks.  I guess we are supposed to trust in the process.  <a href="https://twitter.com/satyanadella?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" rel="nofollow ugc">https://twitter.com/satyanadella?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</a></p>

				<p>Having suffered a UPS explosion and fire in a military lab (software and hardware development), it changed completely our way of thinking.</p>
<p>Bottom line, the UPS should never be in the same cabinet, let alone the same room as the servers or equipment the servers control.</p>

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing, Anders, Etienne, SpaceLifeForm, All,</p>
<blockquote><p>The picture of the melted cladding looks a lot like the melted cladding on the Grenfell Tower.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell these days with the way they build buildings what is an already built building with added cladding to resolve structural failings, one that has had cladding added as a &#8220;face lift&#8221; or new builds where all they put up is &#8220;steel work&#8221; support structure that is reinforced concrete with what looks like cladding being the exteria finish behind which no loadbearing insulation and internal finishing are added.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important too know for several reasons but the most important is the &#8220;chimney effect&#8221;.</p>
<p>In times past people faced off solid brick walls with &#8220;weather boarding&#8221; what this did was not just keep the wind, rain and sunshine from damaging the brickwork it also provided an &#8220;updraft effect&#8221; between the cladding and the wall that sucked moisture out of the solid brick walls making them drier and thus less able to conduct heat. The gap also provided a form of insulation it&#8217;s self. Such boarding was often made with ceeder as it did not need to be lime washed etc.</p>
<p>The problem is such houses burnt rather quickly and dramatically and were difficult to put out. So solid walls got replaced with cavity walls where the chimney effect did not realy exist. However cavity walls became bad news when people started injecting &#8220;cloased cell foam&#8221; into the cavity because of amongst other things it trapped the condensation into the house hence a plague of &#8220;black spot&#8221; mould which is very dificult to get rid off. So the trend switched back to cladding but more high tech&#8230;</p>
<p>The first mistake people make is not understanding what is and is not flamable. Even diamonds given the right conditions will burn as will most metals. To see this hold a small piece of &#8220;steel wool&#8221; in a pair of pliers and just put an ordinary lighter under the bulk of the wool to see steel burn. Basicall any molecule that can form an oxide will burn, even some oxides will burn (Carbon monoxide or &#8220;town gas&#8221; being the most widely known).</p>
<p>Essentially any unoxidized molecule is a fuel for an appropriate oxidizer and sufficient energy to get over the &#8220;entropy hump&#8221; then watch out as the energy release can be extreme, which is why &#8220;thermic lances&#8221; can go through concrete and rebar relatively easily and thermite can be &#8220;fun&#8221; as well as capable of welding railway/road rails together.</p>
<p>Thus few things are actually &#8220;fire proof&#8221; most are at best &#8220;fire retardant to a temprature point&#8221;. All you need is an oxidizer and sufficient energy a runaway process can start.</p>
<p>Which is why the design of chimneys used to be an art. We know from high school science that less dense gas rises above more dense gases it is after all why party balloons float. We should also know that as a gas is heated it normally becomes less dense as the molecules vibrate and speed up more (which is what transferes the energy from one point to another). We should also know that even molecules have inertia. So put that together and you can see that as the tenprature differential between gas in the chimney and ambiant increases more work is done on the gas in the chimney, and the chimney becomes a thermal engine rapidly pulling ambiant air with oxygen in it at the bottom over any hot fuel. It can if you get it right act like a jet engine and sound like a rocket engine hence the name &#8220;rocket stoves&#8221;. What many do not realise is that as the temprature rises, other molecules in turn become viable fuel and not &#8220;smoke&#8221; thus wood burnt in a rocket stove or similar design becomes way more efficient and releases even more energy so you get a runaway process. As a rough rule of thumb the taller a chimney the greater the velocity of the &#8220;updraft&#8221; thus the faster oxygen is brought in and the greater the energy release. It&#8217;s a similar process that makes hurricanes and typhoons with the chimney forming from the vortex effect of rapidly turning air creating lower pressure inside than out and the warm ocean water providing the initial energy to start, and then sustain it.</p>
<p>If you want a lab experiment to demonstrate this all you need is a lit candle and a large enough diameter glass tube. As you put the tube over the candle the flame grows not just in size but intensity. It&#8217;s an important effect as &#8220;oil&#8221; usually burns with a dull flame and a lot of unburnt hydrocarbons we call &#8220;smoke&#8221;. Add the glass tube and the flame burns much brighter and hotter consuming the unburnt hydrocarbons releasing more energy of which a small but increasing fraction is visable light.</p>
<p>But you do not actually need a fire to see this in action a thin walled black painted pipe of sufficient dimensions will with sunlight on it cause the air inside to rise. Thus the likes of &#8220;effluant storage tanks&#8221; will have the smell and potentially explosive gasses drawn off.</p>
<p>And it does not need to be a pipe as such. What happened in part at Grenfell tower, was &#8220;contractors&#8221; stored rubish and other flamable materials at the bottom of an open stair well. Which they might not have realised was exactly the same thing you do with wood in a fire place. That is the floor was the grate and the stair well the chimney&#8230;</p>
<p>Outside the gap between the clading and the wall became another chimney&#8230; Once started the thermal energy went up crossing the entropy humps of more and more materials and the process became run away and the only way to stop it was to rob the combustion of temprature. The material that has a very high thermal capacity and even greater &#8220;phase change&#8221; energy requirment to become &#8220;raw steam&#8221; is water&#8230;</p>
<p>So I suspect from the intensity and near vertical burning of the data center, one of the first things they will be looking for is &#8220;the chimney&#8221; that made things not normally flamable to get hot enough to burn&#8230;</p>
<p>Which will also involve examining for the initial &#8220;ignition source&#8221; and energy supply.</p>
<p>Whilst the UPS is potentially the cause, I&#8217;ve seen way too little information to say if it was a battery based UPS or a full diesel Gen-Set UPS, I suspect from the function of the building it is more likely the latter, especially if there was building work going on as the materials around the building suggest.</p>

				<p>Last night I finished reading 2034: A Novel of the Next World War by Elliot Ackerman and ADM James Stavridis USN. This is a novel about a major-power showdown that races out of control.</p>
<p>The reason I post about the novel here is that one of the important subtexts introduced is the question whether high tech really makes us safer than low tech. The development of the question throughout the book is very well done with many shades of gray. Most of us in the tech world will see several ideas we have considered ourselves in our professional or private lives. ADM Stavridis has addressed this question several times in print and in speaking engagements for the past number of years.</p>
<p>Am I really safer in my smart home with motion detectors, internet-connected cameras, door locks, thermostats and auto-dialing alarms compared to my neighbor with his Rottweiler, landline phone and shotgun? And if so, safer from whom?</p>
<p>Am I safer on my offshore fishing boat with GPS/GLONASS/Galileo/BeiDou or a sextant? Should I be concerned that my adult children rely on Google Maps/Waze but cannot read a map, much less have a map?</p>
<p>Most of us will see that these are not binary choices but tradeoffs and that means we have to have a risk management framework to make reasonable choices. Stress on &#8216;reason&#8217;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the consumers and businesses in the world adopt technologies less for their ability to solve our problems and much more for their titillation and cachet. All of us want to be hip and endlessly entertained. But these technologies do solve problems for some people; think advertisers and governments. In the wrong hands, and they always end up in the wrong hands, they act as force multipliers for our enemies.</p>
<p>The book is about much more than this idea and I recommend it to all of us, especially techs.</p>
<p>Confession: I didn&#8217;t read the book &#8211; I listened to it on Audible (at 1.3x!) during my commute. I feel dirty. I purposely avoid all video news sources to limit my exposure to the breathless emotionalism of news presenters. Reading news allows me the freedom to consider the facts and analysis of the author without the emotionalism which is often the real message.</p>

<p>One thing that is really interesting is that Big Tech do not use each other’s tech.  And a lot of their processes are low tech.  They don’t put their sensitive data in the cloud.</p>
<p>The outcome of this fiasco will change the way secure institutions do business.  PPP loans are keeping mid market in business.  There’s no money for them to migrate to the cloud.  And the Government and regulated sector will continue to NOT do so.</p>
<p>We need a competitor to Microsoft to emerge out of the ashes, that focuses on security and is entirely on-prem.  If the Federal GSA wants to host their own cloud and lease it out to Fed agencies that might be doable.  But the lesson learned from this is don’t rely on a single vendor for your survival.  Do not single source.  Have redundancy and diversity throughout your tech stack.  There needs to be a business continuity plan for each critical vendor in the tech stack.  What happens if that vendor is attacked and cannot function?  Today the plan for Gov and regulated sector is to rely on banked software code in escrow.  But that is inconceivable and needs to be updated to reflects today’s reality.  Because that banked code would have had vulnerabilities in it too.  The failover plan should be to have alternative vendors primed and ready to go.   Disaster recovery data centers should be an alternate universe of different vendors to failover to.  This means different cloud and SaaS vendors too.  This is why data needs to be designed and structured for portability and we need to move to a very robust ISO data dictionary for all regulated data.  GDPR and CCPA require data portability.  But it is not achievable now.</p>
<p>Today’s data is stored as a “blob” in Azure and that means there’s no way to failover to an alternate universe unless you replicate the entire cloud infrastructure and data with another cloud vendor.  And that’s cost prohibitive.  So the solution is to reimagine what backup and disaster recovery means in a cloud environment.  Because for the last few days I am sure that lots of those affected wish they had the means to implement BC/DR but recognized that they don’t have any for Microsoft.  The legal definition of backup is that you are storing your data on 2 different types of media and 1 copy is offsite.  Cloud is not under anyone’s control but the vendor, so conceivably that’s not backup in a regulated environment.  Because 1 version then still needs to be on different media under the customer’s direct control.  Meaning the cloud vendors cannot have all the data.</p>
<p>When a company is bricked by ransomware they restore from that 3rd version onto brand new equipment (swap out drives).  We need to consider the application layer too.</p>
<p>Lots of lessons learned from this.  Lots of processes need to be updated.</p>

				<p>@ All</p>
<p>Perhaps what needs to change most of all are Accounting rules.</p>
<p>It is much easier for businesses to allocate money to new IT projects rather than invest in sustaining existing operations.  It is a matter of OPEX vs CAPEX.  Cybersecurity staff are OPEX and new IT projects are CAPEX, which means they can be included as an “asset” on the balance sheet and depreciated.  Wall St is ok with CAPEX and not ok with increased OPEX because that reduces margin.</p>
<p>But when an organization is in constant IT project mode they use that as an excuse to freeze improvements on the to be retired environment.  Yet these CAPEX projects are never ending.  So it becomes a situation where the operational systems are in a constant to-be-retired state.</p>
<p>Also OPEX staff is often outsourced to lowest cost possible, because most of the money is going to CAPEX.  Perhaps there needs to be US accounting rules about what constitutes acceptable IT and cyber operating cost percentage in companies of various sizes and sectors.  Also that should be a reportable metric in the quarterly reporting.  It would help both investors and customers determine whether the business is sufficiently protected.  It is inconceivable for the BOD to glean this otherwise, as is presently the case.  We need standards in order to know what are acceptable metrics.</p>
<p>Germany requires that corporations report on staffing metrics in their annual reporting.  They disclose how much direct hire staff in each functional area and also report on their country location.  Germany does this to increase visibility into the hiring within Germany.  It might be related to their fabulous apprenticeship programs that the government underwrites.  This is what keeps unemployment low and also why Germany produces the best products.</p>
<p>I never complain.  I solution.  I see lots of potential for improvement here.  Always drill down to root cause and the solution becomes more apparent.</p>

				<p>T-Mobile is doing an end run around Apple and Android by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-ad-targeting-program-205736695.html" rel="nofollow ugc">forcing customers to opt out</a> to avoid them <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/privacy-center/our-practices/privacy-policy" rel="nofollow ugc">merging location data with tracking pixels for ad targeting.</a></p>
<p>Important things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>T-Mobile and Sprint have merged; the latter currently requires opt-in.
</li>
<li>They don&#8217;t sell <i>precise</i> location data, which implies they sell some level of location data.
</li>
<li>They don&#8217;t track which people are children; I had to opt out for my teenager, she was automatically enrolled. Not knowingly tracking children is just a fig leaf.
</li>
<li>They convert specific data into &#8220;inferences&#8221; which may be like Facebook&#8217;s clustering or Google&#8217;s FLoC, which the EFF calls <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea" rel="nofollow ugc">a terrible idea.</a>
</li>
<li>De-anonymizing the data is easy to do once you are merging data with browser tracking.
</li>
<li>Once T-Mobile sells the data (or the data is stolen) they lose control over it. Even if what they sell can&#8217;t be de-anonymized, that may change when combined with third-party data.
</li>
<li>Even if think they are trying to find a responsible balance between privacy and profits, they are building themselves a slippery slope, the depths of which they don&#8217;t understand or control.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s the meat of the advertising section of the <a href="" rel="nofollow ugc">privacy policy.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
T‑Mobile data use for advertising Under T‑Mobile’s personalized ads program, T‑Mobile will use and analyze data from your device and usage data generated by your use of T‑Mobile products and services to create inferences for our own and 3rd party advertising until you tell us not to use it. This data helps us understand more about user interests (e.g., sports enthusiast, loves cooking, etc.). To build these inferences, we will use information like broadband information, network diagnostic data (Android users only), IP address, device and advertising IDs, mobile apps installed or used with your device, content interactions, like video and content viewing info, and web browsing data, device activity and attributes.</p>
<p>When we share information like inferences with third parties, it is not tied to your name or information that directly identifies you. Instead, we tie it to your mobile advertising identifier or another unique identifier.</p>
<p>We do not use or share Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”) or precise location data for advertising unless you give us your express permission. We also do not use information from company liable T‑Mobile for Business or T‑Mobile for Government, T‑Mobile prepaid, or Assurance Wireless accounts for advertising.

<p>As somebody who was involved with the design, installation and support of server farms and data centres for many years, I agree with your comment. In fact, my proposed data centre designs, had separate server room, communication room, power supply room, control room, etc., with each area isolated from the other. We also proposed other options such as inert atmosphere inside the data centre, reducing the oxygen percentage to prevent combustion and others, depending on customer requirements&#8230;</p>
<p>These measures are described below:</p>

				<p>@Clive, JonKnowsNothing, Anders, Etienne, SpaceLifeForm, Fed.up:</p>
<p>When I saw a photo of the fire-damaged data center, I thought &#8220;an odd-looking building&#8221; &#8230; but as Fed.up trenchantly observed, it&#8217;s just a stack of shipping containers.</p>
<p>Its &#8220;cladding&#8221; was presumably limited to the coats of paint on the individual containers.</p>
<p>Without attempting an analysis, I would have supposed that a shipping container would be among the easiest shelters to secure from fire, though the large penetration(s) provided for power, data, cooling etc. are likely to make them much more vulnerable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been out of the fire protection industry for so long, I didn&#8217;t even know that Halon is mostly banned (thanks to Clive for educating me on this).  In any case, such systems to nothing to prevent fires: their design intention is to reduce damage once fire has developed sufficiently to trigger the detection apparatus.</p>
<p>We can propose a whole host of measures to reduce the risk of such comprehensive data center damage, but surely the first one is stupid-simple: disperse the containers (exactly as the U.S. failed to do with aircraft in December 1941).</p>
<p>The minimal spacing for cranes to navigate through the grid would be more than sufficient to limit damage from even a ferocious container fire to its nearest few neighbors.</p>
<p>And as anybody who understands fire risk could tell you, NEVER EVER EVER EVER stack them!  Mega-stupidity.  [I would make a specific exception for sites with flooding risk, to put each data center module atop one or two &#8220;foundation&#8221; containers, these having openings to allow water ingress/egress.]</p>
<p>Piling up data center modules like kids&#8217; blocks surely seemed like an admirable economy of land use, and land in or near urban centers is famously expensive.</p>
<p>But I think the U.S. is not the only country with what we call &#8220;brownfield&#8221; sites &#8212; disused industrial land, which is often less desirable for commercial or real estate development, and often has soil contaminated by pollutants.  Typically, such sites are convenient to road and rail lines, and have abundant electrical service available as a legacy of their former uses.  Such land is not so expensive, and a dispersed modular center can be far more robust.</p>
<p>Maintaining security surveillance is no doubt a little easier with the containers all in one pile, but guarding modules dispersed on one rectangular lot isn&#8217;t such a hard problem.</p>
<p>If computer geeks are too stupid to solve such common-sense challenges (as the modular-pile data center design plainly shows), their insurance companies can usefully steer them in the right direction &#8230;</p>

				<p>@ Shaun,</p>
<blockquote><p>In the wrong hands, and they always end up in the wrong hands, they act as force multipliers for our enemies.</p></blockquote>
<p>You are conflating two rather different ideas there, and thus you are confusing a situation and wotse not dealingvwith it objectively.</p>
<p>The first thing you have to remember is,</p>
<p>Mankind designs technology in opposition to entropy and it&#8217;s a race that mankind will eventualy loose.</p>
<p>So things decay and mankind seaks not just to halt the decay but actually reverse things such that mankind makes headway against the relentless march that entropy is. The results are three fold,</p>
<p>1, We get what we call technology at a price.<br />
2, We use a lot of energy frome finite sources in the process.<br />
3 Thus we hasten the colapse of not just technology but mankind.</p>
<p>But the thing about technology os it either works or it does not work. It has no ability to conceptualize Good/Bad other than by rules we build in to the technology.</p>
<p>More simply technology is &#8220;agnostic to use&#8221; it does what it is both designed to do and constrained by those that put rules and limitations in as well as those that point it in any given direction.</p>
<p>In the main rules and limitations increase the complexity of technology thus as a general rule they are left out or minimised. But almost always such rules have over riddens such that a controling human can take over.</p>
<p>Thus the use of technology is not governed by the hand that holds it, the finger that rests on the button because they indirectly are under the control of the &#8220;directing mind&#8221;.</p>
<p>There for it is the Directing mind thet defines Good/bad, friend/enemy asset/detriment.</p>
<p>Those who chose to Accumulate power are aware that they need power to increase the power. They have got[1].</p>
<p>Thus they have two basic questions</p>
<p>1, How to get initial power.<br />
2, How to increase that power.</p>
<p>The answer to both questions always involves some form of technology, from the thrown rock to the nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>Because technology over time follows the yogurt recipe effect in that technology begets technology. From this it is seen that better technology gives an increase in power even if it is only making it more efficient. Whilst not entirely true the basic viewpoint that arises amongst those seeking power is &#8220;best tech wins&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Thus a side effect is to think that if you deny others technology you will automatically win. But this can be seen from the yogurt recipe effect to be self defeating, which is what happened woth European religion, it held back technology and knowledge as best it could thus slowing societal change to the point that it was quite small across the then average adult lifetime of three decades. With those in power enjoying adult life times of near six decades you can see why they fairly fervently believed in controling knowledge and hording it.</p>
<p>Whilst the status of long adult life time over short is now considerably less than it once was in any given society it still exists (see maximum  expected average life time difference between afluent West London, and deprived East London of 82years and 56years respectively).</p>
<p>Thus there are still good reasons why the chasing of power to gain affluence thus longer life,  thus the chasing and hording of technology exists.</p>
<p>The problem for those seeking power id that usually they do not have either the temperament or inclination to develop technology. Thus they use the power they have accrued to obtain technology in one way or another.</p>
<p>Just half a life time ago in the early 1980&#8217;s the development of leading edge technology was still in the hands of those with political power (defence etc spending). Though the ending of WWII and the massive technological leaps it brought to those in power, gave victory, it also started to escape from Government control. Because technology which is mainly agnostic to use in that period had developed outside of actual weapons and had in that period become supprisingly less conflict biased and more applicable to development of society. This was seen in both personal transport and personal electronics. The very expensive thermionic tubes of prior to WWII had ceased to exit, with mass production making them smaller, lighter, more robust and more importantly many many times improved in performance. This in of it&#8217;s self spured forward further technology development in the 1950&#8217;s with the transistor, which about a decade later was in many affluent teanager and younger hands (mine being just one of many pairs). By the 1970&#8217;s inyegrated circuits or &#8220;chips&#8221; were rapidly developing half way through that decade computer chips became sufficiently available that &#8220;hobbiests&#8221; could build their own computers, mechanical terminals were being replaced by VDU&#8217;s and in the mid to late part of the 1970&#8217;s home computers had started to sell well (see history of Apple ][). The early 1980&#8217;s was the time of the home 8bit computers the mid 1980&#8217;s were the start of true 16bit office computers on desks and 32bit Personal Computers (PC) were around at the start of the 1990&#8217;s. This enabled electronics engineers to do personaly at home in a few weeks what just a couple of decades before required several years by well funded teams and a lot of equipment that cost more than even a proffessional earned in a year. Technology had escaped the hands of Governments. Now you can by $1 microcontrolers with more computing power than minicomputers costing the equivalent of 10 million times as much. In the process kind of proving economists wrong about deflation effects.</p>
<p>Unfortunately tecunology in the process crossed another line that of &#8220;connectivity&#8221; back in the 1980&#8217;s we had dial up lines and payed by the minute to connect to bulletin-boards. Thus you did a lot of stuff off line and tried to make it efficient to send with thought, care, compression and error correcting upload software. Thus people were not just uploading random thought. Now connectivity has massive bandwidth and is as far as mostvare concerned continuously connected. Thus every near meaningless thought sight or sound gets uploaded. Governments through technologists who talked to engineers could see this comming and the one thing they had learned from WWII was listening in on peoples communications had real power to change outcomes. Even when you could not listen into peoples communications just seeing who communicated with who for how long, when, how urgently and what changes gave even more power if managed properly. That is in  what we now call &#8220;traffic analysis&#8221; the potential for real power, real control came to the greedy ears and eyes of the power hungry. Thus the technology agnostic to use that had droped so much in cost ment the dreams of past tyrants and dictators could be not just put in place, bit actually in a way that saved money by making traditional investigators redundant.</p>
<p>So we have reached a point where real human skills are being lost to faux skills of algorithms and the majority of the pipulation is actually seeing their real status and fortunes diminish day by day. Thus the times of the Baronies and their surfs are returning&#8230;</p>
<p>There are many problems with this one of which which few are considering currently but realy realy should be is &#8220;lost skills&#8221;. New technologies require skills that are often built up over a life time of working at the leading edge of technology, if your work force are unskilled then they can not develop new technology. The result is that whilst the new Barons will have status for their life time, their children will lose it because they will have lost any technological lead they had back as little as three decades ago&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just one of the reasons I have been going on about out sourcing. Those who seek power are generally short term thinkers thus to them &#8220;A cent today is more important than a dollar a year from now&#8221; the trouble is that cent is not earned behind it is the loss of the potential that makes the dollar, they give that potential to those who give them the cent in return&#8230; Ask yourself who is getting the real deal, the outsourcer with his cent or the person who gave him the cent getting a dollars worth of technology knowledge and processes? In the UK we call such stupidity as &#8220;The drunk selling the family silver for another drink&#8221;. We&#8217;ve seen what happens history has it documented well, but the outsourcers never majored in understanding histories down sides. Those that seek power likewise so they do not see the trap&#8230; Whilst others you call the &#8220;enemy&#8221; do.</p>
<p>[1] This effect is sometimes called &#8220;The yogurt recipe effect&#8221; from the fact that,</p>
<p>Yogurt = yogurt + warm milk over time.</p>

<p>Interesting.  when I created comment 370737, comments 370733 and 370734 from the real Winter were NOT VISIBLE TO ME.</p>
<p>I was almost 30 minutes later.  This is not the 5 minute batcache issue.  There is something else happening.</p>
<p>Comments 370735, 370736 are obvious that it is the same sockpuppet.   Also past 5 minute batcache.  Also NOT VISIBLE TO ME at time of 370737.</p>
<p>@ Winter</p>
<p>Do not get frustrated.  We got your back.</p>

<p>re: <i> Stacking Shipping Containers </i></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know anything about how these were setup for data centers but I know a bit about shipping containers.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are designed to be stacked.</li>
<li>There are several type, sizes, dimensions</li>
<li>There are several standards mil-spec, non-mil-spec</li>
<li>There are standards for use type, food and perishables, non perishables</li>
<li>Ships stack many on deck and more below decks</li>
<li>There are a good number at the bottom of the oceans either from lost ships or from on deck ones going overboard</li>
</ul>
<p>They have a number of uses and we have loads of surplus ones.  Depending on the view of the person and how the container has been retrofitted they can be quite useful or harmful.</p>
<p>Well done versions are useful lower-cost housing (relative to USA standard stick frame house).  Multiple stacked and refitted versions can be attractive and are fire safe(ish).</p>
<p>Multiple stacked versions used as prisons are not attractive and they are not well refitted.  The floors of the containers may not be properly removed/replaced and that can cause health issues.</p>
<p>A well designed container aka pod house can cost $40-150K USD provided you have a property, and that they are allowed as housing units.  This varies by state, county, city in the USA. Most container houses will have repaint, cladding or exterior camouflage as part of the house design.</p>
<p>Using them for storage may require permits, earth anchors (wind, flood) and the required space for delivery and setup.</p>
<p>A good quality, large, clean unit costs $5k USD.  A storage unit costs $2-3k USD.</p>
<p>Crummy housing, is crummy no matter how it&#8217;s done. Adequate / good housing can be done with new materials and new ideas.</p>

				<p>The idea of modular data centers was first introduced as a way to rapidly build out white space and the modules would go inside another existing data center.  I doubt that this France DC would be legal in the US &#8211; likely wouldn’t pass bldg code.</p>
<p>This was a crypto data center.</p>
<p>The Exchange exploit is supposedly being used to mine cryptos so data centers need to be vigilant to the power consumption and not trust the ICS.  SolarWinds controls data center components and can be used to compromise ICS (which controls power, cooling and fire suppression).  I suspect the mining may be an attack vector to purposely drive up the heat to destroy equipment and cause fire.</p>
<p>Also F5 Networks was attacked this week.  No dark (unmanned) data centers now.</p>
<p>All of the attacks over the past few months are related, even the Verkada security cameras.</p>
<p>I don’t think that exchange email was the high value target.  It is the data center.</p>
<p>If you want to geek out on data centers, I recommend FB engineering.  Google too.</p>

<p>The BBP formula gives rise to a spigot algorithm for computing the nth base-16 (hexadecimal) digit of π (and therefore also the nth binary digit of π) without computing the preceding digits.</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<p>Re #comment-370763</p>
<p>Unusual to put it mildly.</p>
<p>As,for &#8220;pi day&#8221; it&#8217;s also &#8220;mother&#8217;s day&#8221; in the UK[1] which do you think is going to win on points?</p>
<p>So go half way and eat Apple Pie in the US[2] today and make that otherwise meaningless phrase have real meaning[3].</p>
<p>Mind you some in the US already have marked morhers day this year under the Code of Virginia Commonwealth : Title 2.2, Section 2.2 3303. Which also gives it more food for thought.</p>
<p>[1] In the UK the religious calander for Easter and associated dates such as &#8220;Lent&#8221; and the Fourth Sunday in Lent which is &#8220;Mothering Sunday&#8221; are based on the phases of the moon. Which is why it&#8217;s traditional for some to give Daffodils as they are usually in bloom then sometimes above snow.</p>
<p>[2] As for mothers day in the US it&#8217;s not the phases of the moon that dictate it, just the vaguries of that extra day or two each year that makes the week rotate on the calendar, as it&#8217;s just &#8220;the second sunday in May&#8221; so Pi day is never going to coincide with Mother&#8217;s day in the US&#8230;</p>
<p>[3] A statment usually so obvious, it is effective pointless to say. But also so ubiquitous it&#8217;s also devoid of real meaning thus ironicaly it is used as not just an example but a class clasifier of meaningless managment speak proclamations. So we get XXX is just a &#8220;Mothehood and Apple Pie statment&#8221;.</p>

				<p>@ urbanmonk, ALL</p>
<p>With regards,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brusselstimes.com/news/belgium-all-news/159039/cracking-of-encrypted-text-messaging-service-sky-ecc-app-dealt-major-blow-to-organised-crime/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.brusselstimes.com/news/belgium-all-news/159039/cracking-of-encrypted-text-messaging-service-sky-ecc-app-dealt-major-blow-to-organised-crime/</a></p>
<p>There is little evidence thus a lot of speculation that you woyld expect in an information vaccum.</p>
<p>What we do know is that Sky ECC deny the claim,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epd3km/sky-ecc-hacked-fake-app" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.vice.com/en/article/epd3km/sky-ecc-hacked-fake-app</a></p>
<p>Oh and the US Gov has decided to issue indictments of criminal charges against Sky ECC personnel,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4adzdj/sky-secure-global-indictment" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.vice.com/en/article/4adzdj/sky-secure-global-indictment</a></p>
<p>But whilst the Belgian authorities claim to have &#8220;cracked&#8221; the application they have not said how.</p>
<p>Thus my first guess is that if the application did do end to end encryption securely (which is douvtfull) then the authorities somehow did an &#8220;end run&#8221; around the application encryption and such and probably got access to the User Interface or a plaintext file store or equivalent on the mobile phone.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;d be suspicious of any claims of &#8220;end to end encryption&#8221; when a company charges very large subscription fees and talks about it&#8217;s own secure network. To function such a network would need meta-data and thus would require &#8220;link encryption&#8221; for that. Would developers keep the link encryption entirely seperate from any end to end encryption, I suspect not. Because I suspect the reuse of components which is way to big a draw to developers gave rise to a code library and thus componebts would be optomised and shared etc.</p>
<p>But the big failing of all these applications as I repeatedly point out is,</p>
<p><b>The &#8220;Security end point&#8221; being on the same device as the &#8220;Open communications end point&#8221; means that in practice the &#8220;Security end point&#8221; occures before the &#8220;Open communications end point&#8221; thus can not ever be secure as &#8220;end run attacks&#8221; will always be available.</b></p>
<p>Put more simply the encryption that secures the message contents, needs not only to be propperly end to end, it also needs to be done off of the device with the Open communications. The fact that no &#8220;secure messaging app&#8221; does this means they are all insecure. Someyhing I realy wish people would wake upto&#8230;</p>
<p>Take the Vice/Motherboard articles, they all ask &#8220;whistleblowers&#8221; to contact them via &#8220;OTR&#8221;&#8230; So they do not understand the irony let alone the security.</p>
<p>Whilst having &#8220;crooks&#8221; get caught is something most would think is good it&#8217;s not in many ways&#8230;</p>
<p>The reality is that people are not thinking it through, instead they are reacting to a polititions &#8220;dog whistle&#8221; or &#8220;Think of the children&#8221; type emotional knee jerk. Look at it this way, what you might think of as a &#8220;Whistleblower&#8221; or similar is usually seen by those in authority especially crooked politicians as &#8220;crooks&#8221;&#8230; Thus the breaking of all these supposadly &#8220;secure apps&#8221; will follow the old,</p>
<p>&#8220;First they came for the&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Quotation[1] and if people ignore this and do not stop it then they will find out the hard way the implications towards the end of the quote of,</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they came for me&#8230;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Privacy is without any doubt a &#8220;Social Good&#8221; the fact a limited number chose to use a &#8220;Social Good&#8221; to hide their bad, does not in any way stop it from being not just a &#8220;Social Good&#8221; but a very necessary one to protect the health and well being of society and ALL that live in it.</p>

<p>My guess is that the servers were cracked and a MITM attack was executed. When I see how easy E2E encryption protocols can go wrong, and how much effort, e.g., Signal has to make to combine it with was of use, I am not surprised.</p>

				<p>COVID-19 is a vascular endotheliitis. SARS-CoV-2 doesn&#8217;t attack the lungs alone. It attacks the lining of blood vessels in all internal organs and causes pneumonia by making capillaries in the lungs leak fluid into the air spaces.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2&#8217;s Spike protein increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Any mRNA vaccine that causes your cells to make the Spike will make your BBB more permeable.</p>

				<p>Why are they pushing the COVID vaccine so hard?</p>
<p>The vaccine hasn’t even been around for 6 months. I believe it is an experimental vaccine, but there is so many different articles and opinions, so who knows if that theory is true. Don’t crucify me for saying that. Why is everyone rushing to the door lining up for a vaccine when we don’t even know the long term side effects. I’ve just never seen or heard the government, media, Hollywood, etc. pushing a new vaccine so hard. Biden’s speech rubbed me the wrong way when he kept repeating that we must listen to the science, we must believe the CDC and Fauci, and we must get the vaccine. Who the hell still listens to Fauci 😂😂😂 plus the CDC contradicts itself daily! How come they never have actual doctors who work in the doctors office or hospital on the news? They are always interviewing these “scientists”, “doctors” and Bill Gates. Bill Gates, that’s a whole other topic in itself. This morning on CNN some medical writer told Chris Cuomo that we need to change the thinking of the people who are hesitant to take the vaccine. Lots of talking about changing our thinking. Hmmm, sound familiar? Well, it scares me!</p>
<p>Is the vaccine supposed to be magical? I mean, the CDC said this morning that you can still contract Covid if you are fully vaccinated. So why push so hard for something that isn’t even effective? Why do they suspend accounts and pull articles from the web when people talk about the bad side effects of the vaccine, not to mention the deaths! They take down those articles and stories real quick. Ive also noticed that people lose their shit if you tell them you aren’t getting the vaccine. Omg it’s like you have the plague and are a horrible anti-vaxx human being. Sorry but refusing to take a vaccine that hasn’t even been around for a year is NOT anti-vaxx and people shouldn’t be shamed for that.</p>
<p>Is it going to change our DNA? Is it supposed to change our brains so we only believe what they want us to believe? Zombies? 😂</p>
<p>Seriously though, why are they pushing this so hard?</p>

&#8220;Why are they pushing the COVID vaccine so hard?&#8221;</p>
<p>To save lives, 2.5M people have died from COVID-19, more to come.</p>
<p>@Casual<br />
&#8220;Why is everyone rushing to the door lining up for a vaccine when we don’t even know the long term side effects.&#8221;</p>
<p>We know the short-time effects of not vaccinating: Death on a grand scale.</p>
<p>@Casuual<br />
&#8220;Is the vaccine supposed to be magical? &#8221;</p>
<p>I assume that humanity would consider vaccination pure magic, until ~1800 or so. Being able to walk around a smallpox infirmary without even getting a little sick would be considered pure magic only 3 centuries ago.</p>
<p>Nowadays, vaccines are a dime a dozen.</p>
<p>@Casual<br />
&#8220;Is it going to change our DNA?&#8221;</p>
<p>That is pure magic. Although, come back in 10 years and CRISPR-CAS might be able to do it.</p>
<p>@Casual<br />
&#8220;Seriously though, why are they pushing this so hard?&#8221;</p>
<p>Think the unthinkable, go utterly outside the box: They do it to save lives!</p>
<p>Maybe you would never ever even consider doing such a mad thing, but they did it. They created a vaccine to save human lives.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m sorry to tell you this, but you are autistic.</p>
<p>You are never prepared for a diagnosis of autism. It is likely that you will experience a range of emotions. It is painful to love so much, to want something so much and not quite get it. You want yourself to get better so badly that you may feel some of the stages commonly associated with grieving. You may &#8220;revisit&#8221; these feelings from time to time in the future. Part of moving forward is dealing with your own needs and emotions along the way.</p>
<p>Getting yourself started in treatment will help. There are many details you will be managing in an intensive treatment program, especially if it is based in your home. If you know you are engaged in meaningful activities, you will be more able to focus on moving forward. It may also free up some of your time so you can educate yourself, advocate for yourself and take care of yourself.</p>
<p>Asking for help can be very difficult, especially at first. Don’t hesitate to use whatever support is available to you. People around you may want to help, but may not know how. Is there someone who can take your family somewhere for an afternoon? Or cook dinner for your family one night so that you can spend the time learning? Can someone pick a few things up for you at the store or do a load of laundry? Or let other people know you are going through a difficult time and could use a hand?</p>
<p>Everyone needs someone to talk to. Let someone know what you are going through and how you feel. Someone who just listens can be a great source of strength. If you can’t get out of the house, use the phone to call a friend.</p>
<p>It may be helpful to listen or talk to people who have been or are going through a similar experience. Support groups can be great sources of information about what services are available in your area and who provides them. You may have to try more than one to find a group that feels right to you. You may find you aren’t a &#8220;support group kind of person.&#8221; For many people in your situation, support groups provide valuable hope, comfort and encouragement.</p>
<p>Louise DeSalvo, in Writing as a Way of Healing, notes that studies have shown that: &#8220;Writing that describes traumatic events and our deepest thoughts and feelings about them is linked with improved immune function, improved emotional and physical health, and positive behavioral changes.&#8221; Some people have found a journal to be a helpful tool for keeping track of their  progress, what is working and what isn’t. Be mindful of the time you spend on the internet. The internet will be one of the most important tools you have for learning what you need to know about autism and how to help yourself. Unfortunately, there is more information on the web than any of us have time to read in a lifetime. There may also be a lot of misinformation.</p>
<p>There are many paths to take, treatment options and opinions. You know yourself best. Work with your treatment team to find what works best for you and your family. Right now, while you are trying to make the most of every minute, keep an eye on the clock and frequently ask yourself these important questions:</p>
<p>Is what I’m reading right now very likely to be relevant to my recovery?</p>
<p>Is it new information?</p>
<p>Is it helpful?</p>
<p>Is it from a reliable source?</p>
<p>Sometimes, the time you spend on the internet will be incredibly valuable. Other times, it may be better for you if you use that time to take care of yourself.</p>

				<p>@Casual @Winter @All</p>
<p>re: <i>“Why are they pushing the COVID vaccine so hard?”</i></p>
<p>In addition to the excellent responses by (the real) Winter,</p>
<p>Consider:  The Mutations</p>
<p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 is mutating, and mutating quickly.  The mutations happen normally and there are a lot of hosts (or victims) for the virus to infect. That&#8217;s YOU.</p>
<p>The more hosts (YOU) the virus can find to infect, the more mutations have a chance to meet other mutations. Mutations can mix with other mutations making more mutations.</p>
<p>The (ZOMBIE EFFECT) here are those (NOT GETTING JABS) providing a continuous conveyor belt of hosts for the virus.  This virus has no problem killing millions.</p>
<p>re: <i> “Seriously though, why are they pushing this so hard?” </i></p>
<p>The urgency is this:</p>
<p>The vaccines available right now, do not work so well with all the mutations. The vaccines help to prevent more mutations from happening because vaccines reduce the number of potential hosts for the virus to infect. Fewer opportunities for infection, slows the rate of devastation.</p>
<p>EVERYONE will get COVID-19 at some point.  Having a vaccine will reduce the severity of the illness.  The vaccines also reduce the chance of DEATH By COVID-19 for YOU.</p>
<p>Your bet is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will get COVID-19 someday (sooner or later).  </li>
<li>I will survive while millions have died. </li>
<li>I will survive in good health.  </li>
<li>I will survive all the mutations and reinfections with no medical help</li>
</ul>
<p>Your risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early Access placement in a cemetery. </li>
<li>A footnote in the numbers of pandemic deaths.  Millions + YOU.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be pointed out that there are a great number of economic policies that plan for &#8220;YOU to Die to save the Economy&#8221;.  This is called Herd Immunity Policy (HIP) and has nothing to do with saving your life.  For HIP economics the only value YOUR life has is if you die.  The faster you die the better.   Countries like Brazil, much of EU, UK, USA and of course the founding source in Sweden enact every method possible to encourage you to die faster.</p>
<p>In the USA, Texas, Florida and many states are opening their economies, dropping mask rules in order to infect their populations faster.</p>
<p>There is a reason all those folks from Upper Wealthy Areas are Vax Queue Jumping.  They know the score.  They want the vaccine.  They plan to keep breathing.  They will take YOUR vaccine for themselves and their friends and their kids and their families.   They are taking YOUR LIFE.</p>
<p>Consider carefully what you allow these people take from YOU.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your educated and well reasoned post, which was delightful to read. Here is my take on that topic:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s not a vaccine. A vaccine by definition provides immunity to a disease. This does not provide immunity to anything. In a best-case scenario, it merely reduces the chance of getting a severe case of a virus if one catches it. Hence, it is a medical treatment, not a vaccine. I do not want to take a medical treatment for an illness I do not have.</li>
<li>The drug companies, politicians, medical establishment, and media have joined forces to universally refer to this as a vaccine when it is not one, with the intention of manipulating people into feeling safer about undergoing a medical treatment. Because they are being deceitful, I do not trust them, and want nothing to do with their medical treatment.</li>
<li>The presumed benefits of this medical treatment are minimal and would not last long in any case. The establishment acknowledges this, and is already talking about additional shots and ever-increasing numbers of new “vaccines” that would be required on a regular basis. I refuse to turn myself into a chronic patient who receives injections of new pharmaceutical products on a regular basis simply to reduce my chances of getting a severe case of a virus that these injections do not even prevent.</li>
<li>I can reduce my chances of getting a severe case of a virus by strengthening my immune system naturally. In the event I catch a virus, there are vitamins and well-established drugs that have had wonderful results in warding off the illness, without the risks and unknowns of this medical treatment.</li>
<li>The establishment insists that this medical treatment is safe. They cannot possibly know this because the long-term effects are entirely unknown, and will not be known for many years. They may speculate that it is safe, but it is disingenuous for them to make such a claim that cannot possibly be known. Because they are being disingenuous, I do not trust them, and I want no part of their treatment.</li>
<li>The drug companies have zero liability if anything goes wrong, and cannot be sued. Same for the politicians who are pushing this treatment. I will not inject myself with a new, experimental medical device when the people behind it accept no liability or responsibility if something goes wrong. I will not risk my health and my life when they refuse to risk anything.</li>
<li>Israel&#8217;s Prime Minister has openly admitted that the Israeli people are the world&#8217;s laboratory for this experimental treatment. I am not interested in being a guinea pig or donating my body to science.</li>
<li>Israel agreed to share medical data of its citizens with a foreign drug company as a fundamental part of their agreement to receive this treatment. I never consented for my personal medical data to be shared with any such entity, nor was I even asked. I will not contribute to this sleazy enterprise.</li>
<li>The executives and board members at Pfizer are on record that they have not taken their own treatment, despite all the fanfare and assurances. They are claiming that they would consider it unfair to “cut the line”. This is a preposterous excuse, and it takes an unbelievable amount of chutzpah to even say such a thing. Such a “line” is a figment of their own imagination; if they hogged a couple of injections for themselves no one would cry foul. In addition, billionaires with private jets and private islands are not known for waiting in line until hundreds of millions of peasants all over the world go first to receive anything these billionaires want for themselves.</li>
<li>The establishment media has accepted this preposterous excuse without question or concern. Moreover, they laud Pfizer&#8217;s executives for their supposed self-sacrifice in not taking their own experimental treatment until we go first. Since they consider us such fools, I do not trust them, and do not want their new treatment. They can have my place in line. I&#8217;ll go to the very back of the line.</li>
<li>Three facts that must be put together:<br />
•   Bill Gates is touting these vaccines as essential to the survival of the human race.<br />
•   Bill Gates believes the world has too many people and needs to be “depopulated”.<br />
•   Bill Gates, perhaps the richest man in the world, has also not been injected. No rush.<br />
    Uh, no. I&#8217;ll pass on any medical treatments he wants me to take.</li>
<li>The establishment has been entirely one-sided in celebrating this treatment. The politicians and media are urging people to take it as both a moral and civic duty. The benefits of the treatment are being greatly exaggerated, the risks are being ignored, and the unknowns are being brushed aside. Because they are being deceitful and manipulative, I will not gamble my personal well-being on their integrity.</li>
<li>There is an intense propaganda campaign for people to take this treatment. Politicians and celebrities are taking selfies of themselves getting injected (perhaps in some cases pretending to get injected), the media is hyping this as the coolest, smartest, most happy and fun thing to do. It is the most widespread marketing campaign in history. This is not at all appropriate for any medical treatment, let alone a brand new one, and it makes me recoil.</li>
<li>The masses are following in tow, posting pictures of themselves getting injected with a drug, feeding the mass peer pressure to do the same. There is something very alarming and sick about this, and I want no part of it. I never took drugs just because “everyone&#8217;s doing it” and it&#8217;s cool. I&#8217;m certainly not going to start now.</li>
<li>Those who raise concerns about this medical treatment are being bullied, slandered, mocked, censored, ostracized, threatened, and fired from their jobs. This includes medical professionals who have science-based concerns about the drug and caregivers who have witnessed people under their charge suffering horrible reactions and death shortly after being injected. When the establishment is purging good people who risk everything simply to raise concerns about a new medical treatment – even if they don&#8217;t outright oppose it – I will trust these brave people over the establishment every time. I cannot think of a single similar case in history when truth and morality turned out to be on the side of the establishment.</li>
<li>This is the greatest medical experiment in the history of the human race.</li>
<li>It is purposely not being portrayed as the greatest medical experiment in the history of the human race, and the fact that it is a medical experiment at all is being severely downplayed.</li>
<li>Were they up front with the masses, very few would agree to participate in such an experiment. Manipulating the masses to participate in a medical experiment under false pretenses violates the foundations of medical ethics and democratic law. I will not allow unethical people who engage in such conduct to inject me with anything.</li>
<li>The medical establishment is not informing people about any of this. They have become marketing agents for an experimental drug, serving huge companies and politicians who have made deals with them. This is a direct conflict with their mandate to concern themselves exclusively with the well-being of the people under their care. Since the medical establishment has become corrupted, and has become nothing more than a corporate and political tool, I do not trust the experimental drug they want so badly to inject me with.</li>
<li>We are being pressured in various ways to get injected, which violates medical ethics and the foundations of democratic society. The best way to get me not to do something is to pressure me to do it.</li>
<li>The government has sealed their protocol related to the virus and treatments for THIRTY YEARS. This is information that the public has a right to know, and the government has a responsibility to share. What are they covering up? Do they really expect me to believe that everything is kosher about all this, and that they are concerned first and foremost with my health? The last time they did this was with the Yemenite Children Affair. If you&#8217;re not familiar with it, look it up. Now they&#8217;re pulling the same shtick. They didn&#8217;t fool me the first time, and they&#8217;re definitely not fooling me now.</li>
<li>The government can share our personal medical data with foreign corporations, but they won&#8217;t share their own protocol on the matter with us? I&#8217;m out.</li>
<li>The establishment has recruited doctors, rabbis, the media, and the masses to harangue people who don&#8217;t want to get injected with a new drug. We are being called the worst sort of names. We are being told that we believe in crazy conspiracies, that we are against science, that we are selfish, that we are murderers, that we don&#8217;t care about the elderly, that it&#8217;s our fault that the government continues to impose draconian restrictions on the public. It&#8217;s all because we don&#8217;t want to get injected with an experimental treatment, no questions asked. We are even being told that we have a religious obligation to do this, and that we are grave sinners if we do not. They say that if we do not agree to get injected, we should be forced to stay inside our homes forever and be ostracized from public life.<br />
This is horrific, disgusting, a perversion of common sense, morality, and the Torah. It makes me recoil, and only further cements my distrust of these people and my opposition to taking their experimental drug. How dare they?</li>
<li>I know of many people who got injected, but none of them studied the science in depth, carefully weighed the potential benefits against the risks, compared this option to other alternatives, was truly informed, and decided this medical treatment was the best option for them. On the contrary, they got injected because of the hype, the propaganda, the pressure, the fear, blind trust in what “the majority of experts” supposedly believed (assuming THEY all studied everything in depth and were completely objective, which is highly dubious), blind trust in what certain influential rabbis urged them to do (ditto the above), or hysterical fear that the only option was getting injected or getting seriously ill from the virus. When I see mass hysteria and cult-like behavior surrounding a medical treatment, I will be extremely suspicious and avoid it.</li>
<li>The drug companies have a long and glorious history of causing mass carnage with wonder drugs they thrust on unsuspecting populations, even after serious problems had already become known. Instead of pressing the pause button and halting the marketing of these drugs until these issues could be properly investigated, the drug companies did everything in their power to suppress the information and keep pushing their products. When companies and people have demonstrated such gross lack of concern for human life, I will not trust them when they hype a new wonder drug. This isn&#8217;t our first rodeo.</li>
<li>Indeed, the horror stories are already coming in at warp speed, but the politicians are not the least bit concerned, the medical establishment is brushing them aside as unrelated or negligible, the media is ignoring it, the drug companies are steaming ahead at full speed, and those who raise a red flag continue to be bullied, censored, and punished. Clearly my life and my well-being are not their primary concern. I will not be their next guinea pig in their laboratory. I will not risk being the next “coincidence”.</li>
<li>Although many people have died shortly after getting injected – including perfectly healthy young people – we are not allowed to imply that the injection had anything to do with it. Somehow this is anti-science and will cause more people to die. I believe that denying any possible link, abusing people who speculate that there might be a link, and demonstrating not the slightest curiosity to even explore if there might be a link is what is anti-science and could very well cause more people to die. These same people believe I am obligated to get injected as well. No freaking thanks.</li>
<li>I am repulsed by the religious, cult-like worship of a pharmaceutical product, and will not participate in this ritual.</li>
<li>My “healthcare” provider keeps badgering me to get injected, yet they have provided me no information on this treatment or any possible alternatives. Everything I know I learned from others outside the establishment. Informed consent has become conformed consent. I decline.</li>
<li>I see all the lies, corruption, propaganda, manipulation, censorship, bullying, violation of medical ethics, lack of integrity in the scientific process, suppression of inconvenient adverse reactions, dismissal of legitimate concerns, hysteria, cult-like behavior, ignorance, closed-mindedness, fear, medical and political tyranny, concealment of protocols, lack of true concern for human life, lack of respect for basic human rights and freedoms, perversion of the Torah and common sense, demonization of good people, the greatest medical experiment of all time being conducted by greedy, untrustworthy, godless people, the lack of liability for those who demand I risk everything&#8230;I see all this and I have decided they can all have my place in line. I will put my trust in God. I will use the mind He blessed me with and trust my natural instincts. Which leads to the final reason which sums up why I will not get “vaccinated.”</li>
<li>The whole thing stinks.</li>

				<p>So much gaslighting.  Ebola &#8211; the 2014 strain just pops up in Guinea and Congo with zero mutations.  These countries are 1,000’s of miles apart and Guinea is closed to travel.  No flights.  The WHO is claiming that someone walked around with Ebola for 7 years and didn’t infect anyone until now.</p>
<p>Scientists are stunned.</p>

				<p>@Informed Sceptic @All</p>
<p>re: <i> The long laundry list of why YOU are taking the Bet On Your Life </i></p>
<p>The life insurance companies have already determined the payouts. YOU won&#8217;t be getting any, or rather, your beneficiaries, if any, won&#8217;t be getting any, since YOU won&#8217;t be around.</p>
<p>re: <i> Item 1. It’s not a vaccine.<br />
&emsp;   A vaccine by definition provides immunity to a disease. </i></p>
<p>It may come as a shock, but vaccines do not provide &#8220;immunity&#8221;.</p>
<p>Vaccines provide the mechanism by which your body&#8217;s natural responses learn to fight off the targeted illnesses by pre-programming the body to produce antibodies to that illness.</p>
<p>The &#8220;immunity&#8221; aspect is part of the &#8220;effectiveness score&#8221;, a number of which may vary and the meaning of which might differ.  This score represents the general statistic outcomes should you encounter that particular virus.</p>
<p>It is in no way a guarantee of &#8220;immunity&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is the probability of outcomes, like flipping a coin. Without a vaccine the coin flips are 100% against you (Tails every time). With a vaccine the coin flips turn towards your favor of survival (more Heads).</p>
<p>Survival may mean:<br />
* no encounter<br />
* an encounter with no noticeable effect<br />
* an encounter with some noticeable effect<br />
* an encounter with serious effects<br />
* no survival = death</p>
<p>Vaccine failures happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>The body doesn&#8217;t react as expected</li>
<li>The virus may be too virulent</li>
<li>The virus may be a mutated version </li>
<li>There is a problem in vaccine production/manufacturing</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unlucky to have a vaccine failure, you will have the same encounter as someone who never got a vaccine.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;May the odds be ever in your favor&#8230;&#8221;</b></p>

				<p>@JonKnowsNothing: <i>It may come as a shock, but vaccines do not provide “immunity”</i>[1]</p>
<p>You should tell that to the Oxford English Dictionary. But yes, I agree with your general argument. I have a slightly different quibble since our govt. has decided that Pfizer will do for everybody, even tho&#8217; they still have valid pre-orders for at least two other flavours. I&#8217;m with @Clive on mRNA, a) the short term miracle that pulled it out of a hat, and b) the unknown long term effects. I&#8217;ll happily swallow any single shot adenovirus, like I&#8217;ve done for many years.</p>
<p>1.vaccine /ˈvaksiːn  , ˈvaksɪn/<br />
▸ noun a substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide immunity against one or several diseases, prepared from the causative agent of a disease, its products, or a synthetic substitute, treated to act as an antigen without inducing the disease:</p>

<b>The Death of Irony, <i>or</i></b><br />
.<br />
<b>Occam, put that down before someone gets hurt!</b></p>
<p>My understanding of the situation to date concerning Covid-19 vaccines (factual corrections welcome, I don&#8217;t follow this stuff very closely):</p>
<p>• several have already been developed in short time frames not seen before</p>
<p>• measured effectiveness (compared to typical modern vaccines) ranges from fairly good to near record levels</p>
<p>• the frequency and severity of adverse reactions attributable to the vaccines seems to be typical of modern vaccines</p>
<p>• no Covid-19 vaccine candidate that has yet reached large-scale testing has either failed to be effective, or caused an unusual frequency or severity of adverse reactions</p>
<p>If these are indeed facts, then what is the <em>least hypothesis</em> consistent with them?</p>

				<p>@ MarkH,</p>
<blockquote><p>several have already been developed in short time frames not seen before</p></blockquote>
<p>This is down to two things,</p>
<p>1, Improvment in techniques<br />
2, We are in the equivalent of a &#8220;War Footing&#8221;.</p>
<p>The technique improvments have come about via a number of things but behind all of them is computer technology. It&#8217;s enabled scientists to be more architects than engineers and most definately not the drudge builders of yesteryear. In particular computer modeling has enabled hundreds of thousands of ideas to be tested against what we know. So acts as a massive &#8220;prefilter&#8221;.</p>
<p>But&#8230; Whilst what we know is vast, it&#8217;s actually very little in reality hence new ideas have to be tested in biology not computers. I wont go into what goes on as it&#8217;s not an area I&#8217;ve any recent experience of, but other new &#8220;in glass&#8221; (in vitro) testing techniques using stem cells and the like cut out a lot of &#8220;in the living&#8221; (in vivo) tests in &#8220;whole&#8221; self sustaining entities such as plants, animals and ultimately humans. Stem cells enable you to create human cells for just about any organ in the body, thus tests on them can answer specific questions and not having to get general but vague results from in vivo tests where the answers are not specific and thus involve all the complications and deficiencies of statistical analysis and can take months or years to show up.</p>
<p>Whilst such lab work is eye wateringly expensive, it is little compared to the cost of running drugs trials, where it can take a year or more in normal times to just get past the &#8220;ethics committees&#8221; and similar. Thus in the past many promising ideas get dropped because there is not the funding or other resources availible to go to drug trials. One significant issue is the prevelance of the pathogen in society. Ethics normally precludes the deliberate infection of individuals with a pathogen. Therefore a drug trial runs untill sufficient of the test subjects in a trial have become naturally infected. The more effective the drug, the longer the trial will take as the required number of infections will have to occure mainly in the placebo group.</p>
<p>Thus the very high prevelence of SARS-CoV-2 hosts in the environment means that the trials are going to run in proportiantly less time.</p>
<p>But this is problematic because mutations occure at a rate proportianal to the prevelance as well.</p>
<p>Thus the importance of a &#8220;war footing&#8221; two major changes happen,</p>
<p>1, Ethical barriers decrease or disapear.</p>
<p>2, Funding and other resources become readily available.</p>
<p>But a third effect can also be brought in, which has happened with COVID, which is what is covered by &#8220;Emergancy Prescribing&#8221; and similar. Effectively it&#8217;s where the regulators reduce their scruitiny on the efficacy and safety of the drug. Primarily this reduction comes about by &#8220;early approval&#8221;, with the main consequence of the reduction in time being the observing for side effects etc. Thus &#8220;short term effects&#8221; becomes &#8220;realy short term effects&#8221;. This is supposadly counter ballanced by increased and longer phase four testing periods.</p>
<p>This increased surveillance in phase four has side effects of it&#8217;s own. One of which is differentiation of correlation being causal or coincidence.</p>
<p>In the ordinary course of events people die, from many things, that is there is a community average that is age dependent for every kind of harm that can befall an individual. One of the failings of humans is &#8220;we see faces in clouds&#8221; that is we are overly sensitive to what we think are patterns. In part this is because &#8220;bad news sprints loud, whilst good news crawls quietly&#8221;. Somebody saying &#8220;George had the jab last week now he&#8217;s dead&#8221; creates bad news that get diseminated quickly and loudly thus people tend to assume it was the jab that killed George. The fact he got killed as a passanger in a road accident won&#8217;t stop some people beliving the jab is somehow to blaim, even though rationally it&#8217;s not at all likely a cause just a coincidence. The same happens with medical conditions the fact that statistically it can be shown with very very high confidence that it is coincidence will not stop people looking to place blaim on the doorstep. We&#8217;ve just seen this with the &#8220;blood clots&#8221; scare story. Yes people have had thrombotic events, they happen all the time the one most have heard of is DVT&#8217;s and yes there are secondary effects such as PE&#8217;s and CE&#8217;s that are the real medical concerns, all of which I&#8217;ve had the misfortune to suffer and I&#8217;m far from the only one.</p>
<p>You can look up the figures but when you find out that the average number is five or ten times that seen in those who have so far had their jab then it is statistically more likely than not to be just unfortunate coincidence not causation (in fact you could argue it the other way and say statistically so far you are less likely to have a thrombotic event after the jab&#8230;).</p>
<p>But humans want &#8220;blaim&#8221; with bad news but &#8220;luck&#8221; with good news, even though you can not logically have it both ways emotionaly that is what people want. Thus it&#8217;s what newspapers sell and politicians make stupid choices on.</p>

<p>re: <i>Fast Track Science for COVID-19 </i></p>
<p>Another part of the fast track puzzle is the data and science behind Phylogenic Tree Tracking. This is the tracking of ancestry and the mutations of the virus.</p>
<p>Some countries have done outstanding on tracking the genome, unfortunately the USA is not one of them.  Other countries have done the heavy lifting on figuring out what parts go where and what parts change.</p>
<p>Added to this is the improvement in protein modeling, where the image data and layout is computer processed to provide a visual aide for understanding the spike protein.</p>
<p>All of these techniques promote global study, harnessing the best abilities of all countries.</p>
<p>re: <i>Quick measured vaccine effectiveness</i></p>
<p>Some lab tests focus on antibody response. The labs have a &#8220;clean wild virus&#8221; base they use as control.  They expose the clean virus and test virus against a list of antibodies, like those targeted for production by the vaccine, and measure the titer response in the lab.</p>
<p>At this juncture, they know a good deal about which antibodies will target the Spike Protein which is the current focus area.  They use antibodies harvested from convalescent plasma to determine how well the virus is controlled (or not).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one way they know the some vaccines work better against a particular set of mutations or is not as effective against others.</p>
<p>@Clive has pointed out the ethical issues, some of which have certainly been ditched, not only for pandemic faster response but also general economic losses and pharma profits.</p>
<p>There are Challenge Trials planned or underway, which are ethically dubious. This is where healthy persons are injected with Live Virus.  Since there is no cure, the risks are high and morally shaky.</p>
<p>iirc(badly) China has too low an incident of COVID-19 to do their vaccine testing in country.  They had to do the testing where COVID-19 is prevalent.  This isn&#8217;t uncommon for Big Pharma to test their stuff on poorer countries;  usually it&#8217;s about saving money on testing.  In the case of COVID-19, these countries got vaccines way before the richer countries did.</p>

<blockquote><p>
COVID-19 is a vascular endotheliitis. SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t attack the lungs alone. It attacks the lining of blood vessels in all internal organs and causes pneumonia by making capillaries in the lungs leak fluid into the air spaces.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, I think this is a terrific discovery. It could significantly change the way COVID is perceived, if digested  appropriately to the masses. Less room for the “little flu” meme. I’m a little surprised this particular fact attracted so few comments (or, what am I <em>not</em> seeing?). Thanks for posting.</p>

<blockquote><p>All of these techniques promote global study, harnessing the best abilities of all countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet the one country most would expect to lead in these matters has a long history of isolationism, as well as a legal framework around so-called intellectual property that discourages international efforts. Note that &#8220;inter&#8221;national does not include the multi-national corporations that choose to work, sell, pay tax, and litigate in different jurisdictions for each activity.</p>

				<p>There are lots of colors of energy not just only black and white. Like 100. I have all of them. Chakras. Anywayss yeah there is obviously different color matter the world is not black and white or greyscale. I don&#8217;t think grey is a color back me up on this. And the talk about emulators in quantum computer well that&#8217;s mostly all they are doing right now. As I&#8217;ve said a million times I changed all the computers to be fully quantum computer but I am just transitioning them gradually so you all don&#8217;t get too much of a shock. You could scramble and study quantum cryptography but it&#8217;s nascent and classic cryptography has not ever been used yet! The only cipher that has been used so far is &#8216;NOT&#8217;. But ANYWAYS the emulation should be used to play the video games made in the 1990-1999 years inclusive. It&#8217;s on steam already.</p>
<p>I have this data on &#8220;&#8216;good authority'&#8221;<br />

				<p>@Freezing_in_Brazil: <i> Less room for the “little flu” meme.</i></p>
<p>Problem is grandstanding national leaders have already grabbed the headlines with their &#8220;little flu&#8221;, and while these researchers have been finding facts tucked in their laboratories away from the panic of saving lives, a whole world of fake &#8220;facts&#8221; has solidified on social media.</p>
<p>In times of crisis truth is often a hard sell.</p>

Interesting things I learned about Halon and other suppressive chemicals from the commentary of a humor post ( hXXps://forums.theregister.com/forum/all/2021/01/11/who_me/ )</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8230; Halon at an effective dispersion is at 10% of the air at most.<br />
Halon works by disrupting the actual chemical reaction of burning, it doesn&#8217;t &#8220;displace all the oxygen&#8221; or &#8220;alter the oxygen to not be breathable&#8221; as so many common myths have it.<br />
[but] It is an Ozone depleting gas, so that is why FM200 was developed. Same things apply though.<br />
======<br />
The &#8216;Halon&#8217; (nowadays it&#8217;s never Halon in a new installation, it&#8217;s something like FM200, which works under similar principles, so everyone just calls it Halon)<br />
&#8230;<br />
FM-200 also produces byproducts that aren&#8217;t particularly healthy for you, but &#8220;they&#8217;re a lot less toxic than the shit that would be burning otherwise&#8221;. He [fire suppression contractor] told us that if we were in the room and the FM-200 dumped, we would survive just fine, but if stuff was on fire, getting away from the fire is a good idea.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, &#8220;fire security measures&#8221; have certain small parallels to &#8220;virus security measures&#8221;&#8230;  preventing a blazing inferno has potential mild side effects, but is still a good idea because blazing infernos are so much worse. (yeah, barely there, but given the over-the-top anti-vaccine discussion in this squiddy issue, it seems more connected)</p>

				<p>Supposedly in Norway 4 case have bloodcloocks, it up to them that injection are given at hospital. I don&#8217;t trust the first vaccine. I could go on statics allow but its four that got a blood test. It was Astrlave, the natural numbers exiled them.</p>

<p>re: Bank of Mom and Dad<br />
    COVID-19 Post Wave 2 Government Benefits from the Dead: End of COVID-19 Year 1</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that time of year when many governments begin to publicize their projected budgets for the coming year (2021).   The economists and statisticians have been busy with their high speed computers running many simulations and projections across all aspects of their economies and global trade.</p>
<p>Buried in some reports will be the odd indication of what has happened during this first year of the pandemic.  Some items won&#8217;t be easy to spot, nothing is easy to spot in such documents, obscurity being their point.  Sometimes these indicators will be negative space, or an alteration in projection that appears odd compared to pre-pandemic budget alignments.</p>
<p>Similar indicators may be found hidden in the stock exchange filings, footnotes and recast numbers or new layout may hold clues to whats happened and future expectations.</p>
<p>This update to the postings on the Bank of Mom and Dad (1) references the permanent and on going benefits of Herd Immunity Policy (HIP).  HIP is not a policy about saving lives by vaccination, it is an economic policy based on killing off parts of the population and reducing government expenditures.  These numbers are buried in their budget analysis.</p>
<p>There are other aspects not included: food, housing, velocity of trade, taxation and asset stripping.</p>
<p>note: I know nothing. There are a lot of zeros and I might have added or dropped one on the copy-paste. Your calcs might be different.</p>
<p>note: Numbers come from different sources and variation is to be expected.</p>
<p>Summary Take Away:</p>
<ul>
<li>For industrial countries, for every person that has died, the government will &#8220;save&#8221; £12,000 per year in direct budget expense.  </li>
<li>UK direct savings from death value is £1.5 Billion.</li>
<li>For industrial countries,  for each person that dies, the ongoing savings in pension NOT paid  is  £150,00 </li>
<li>The on-going savings of escheated pensions is £18.8 Billion for at least 12 years.</li>
<li>For industrial countries, deaths from workers translates to 15 &#8211; 31 years of lost productivity.  </li>
<li>For industrial countries, life expectancy has declined by 1-3 years.</li>
</ul>

				<p>I would not worry at all about vaccines, I used to receive about 6 or 7 vaccines a year, I&#8217;m absolutely fine and completely 100% almost normal.</p>
<p>I used rehabilitate bats, and as the little bastards used to bite and scratch me pretty regularly, and they were generally rare or of an unknown variety, who knew what kind of diseases they carried, the vaccines probably wouldn&#8217;t of worked anyway. Don&#8217;t look after endangered bats people bring to you if you are afraid of needles, or unknown and exotic diseases.</p>
<p>None of the vaccines ever had any kind of side effects apart from the usual mild kind of symptoms from the odd one, a little whoozy for a couple minutes, nothing major. It&#8217;s just like getting a flu shot, totally fine. Harden up son.</p>

&#8220;Don’t look after endangered bats people bring to you if you are afraid of needles, or unknown and exotic diseases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exotic? Rabies is still endemic almost everywhere.</p>
<p>If you ever get bitten by a bat, get your rabies shots. Immediately!</p>

<p>I am still sticking to my theory:  Bats to Civits to Humans.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was massive transmission going on at that market for sure,&#8221; says Linfa Wang, a virologist who studies bat viruses at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. He&#8217;s also part of the WHO investigative team. Wang says that after the outbreak at the Huanan market, Chinese scientists went there and looked for the virus.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the live animal section, they had many positive samples,&#8221; Wang says. &#8220;They even have two samples from which they could isolate live virus.&#8221;</p>

				<p>@greenup, Clive:</p>
<p>I wanted to round out the Halon picture just a little.  My knowledge is slight, but I used to share a cubicle with a mechanical engineer who designed Halon systems (a process which gets surprisingly complex when there&#8217;s more than one nozzle).</p>
<p>greenup&#8217;s information is quite accurate: the toxicity of Halon is so slight, that there&#8217;s no danger in breathing the atmosphere where a system <em>designed for occupied spaces</em> has discharged.  As greenup writes, such systems are designed to keep the Halon concentration within the 10% limit.</p>
<p>But my colleague warned me that if there was actual fire present, get out.  The action of Halon is simple enough:  the CFC molecules are broken down by heat, and the smaller molecules resulting from this decomposition are mostly very reactive, so they devour the oxygen.</p>
<p>This only occurs at the flame front (the edge of the flame at which the fuel and oxygen are meeting), so the Halon fire suppression is remarkably surgical: the molecules are only breaking down and depleting oxygen at the precise places where it&#8217;s necessary.</p>
<p>One of the molecules resulting from heat decomposition of 1301 is phosgene &#8230;</p>
<p>But in any case, having witnessed a system test, my impression is that if you were in a room where the Halon discharged, you would want to get out quickly.</p>
<p>I suspect that the scenario of suffocation is unlikely.  Though 1301 is heaver than air, it mixes with air very easily (which is essential for its fire suppression role).  I don&#8217;t know this for a fact, but I suspect that in practical situations for occupied spaces, the Halon would be sufficiently dispersed by ordinary airflows before it could sink into an air-displacing pool.</p>
<p>Anyway, I know of no incidence of hypoxia resulting from such a discharge.</p>

				<p>@Freezing_in_Brazil:</p>
<p>I seem to remember seeing the same information about Covid-19 as a vascular disease several months ago, somewhere between spring and summer.</p>
<p>In particular, there have been cases of severe cardiovascular manifestations (essentially, heart attack) in patients as young and fit as college athletes.  Even small children have died (rarely, fortunately) from the effects of Covid-19 on blood vessels.</p>
<p>So probably it isn&#8217;t news for those who&#8217;ve been trying to follow the medical reportage.</p>
<p>As you observe, it shows the foolishness of comparing this pandemic to seasonal flu.  Just a few days ago, a commenter here decided that Covid isn&#8217;t even flu, only a cold &#8230;</p>
<p>What won&#8217;t be known for a long time is how much apparently recovered (or even asymptomatic) patients suffer long-term &#8212; or perhaps even permanent &#8212; losses to health in consequence of scarring to lungs and blood vessels.</p>

<p>I used to regularly get the Rabies vaccine, but they were some pretty interesting looking bats. Have not seen many of those species in a long time, but occasionally see the more common varieties. Have not been bitten by a bat though in a very long time, and don&#8217;t think the Rabies vaccine had any nasty side effects, though with PTSD you&#8217;d never know the difference anyway.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Protestors could be an endangered species, if the British Home secretary gets her way.</p>
<p>Police will be able to issue punishment those who “ought” to have known about restrictions rather than needing to prove protestors knew.</p>
<p>The new bill would introduce the crime of &#8220;intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance&#8221; with the intention of preventing protest tactics of occupying public spaces.</p>
<p>It does not matter how small or large a protest is. There is a specific section on “imposing conditions on one-person protests”.</p>
<p>hxxps://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/issue/policing-bill-threatens-protest-rights/</p>
<p>The British Government also has some interesting tenders for anyone interested in developing surveillance and exploitation solutions for telecommunication provisioning.</p>
<p>So good times all round for anyone wishing to cash in on a global pandemic.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the kind of time where if you had dumped your parents in another state, then sold their home to a buyer you had lined up, you&#8217;d probably be feeling right at home, hey Scomo?</p>

<p>This is not some “partisan hack”. I’d encourage commenters to avoid the political spin and conspiracy theorist labeling.</p>
<p>China was building viral bio-weapons and SARS-Cov-2 is a virus that leaked from a lab doing the research. It’s long past time for MSM and politicians to come clean to the public about the origin of the virus.</p>

<p>Why are you continuously spreading nonsense about the true nature of the virus origin? What exactly is you agenda?<br />
Are you a Chinese Wumao or a shill? What potentially nefarious intentions do you harbor?<br />
The only entity that stands to benefit from the misleading pseudo-scientific humbug you are spreading with regards to the actual origin of the virus is the CCP.<br />
Do you really want to strengthen the position the CCP has clawed itself to? What do you have to gain by being that biased and close-minded on that matter?</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm, lurker, Mr. Peed Off, ALL,</p>
<p>Re: time based sidechannel without the use of JavaSript.</p>
<p>This is a product of &#8220;The Xmas Gift that keeps on giving&#8221; and to be honest I&#8217;m surprised it&#8217;s taken so long to happen.</p>
<p>How long have I been saying,</p>
<p>&#8220;Efficiency -v- Security&#8221;</p>
<p>This problem is as a direct result of those &#8220;go faster stripes&#8221; Intel and others marketing teams insisted on for &#8220;Specmanship&#8221; which I&#8217;ve likewise warned about a few times.</p>
<p>As for the shared &#8220;microarchitecture&#8221; well think where it is in the conpuring stack&#8230; It&#8217;s below the ISA so software fix is not going to solve it. It&#8217;s below the microcode level so no fix realy likely there. It&#8217;s at the cach level, which is not that much above the memory level so is almost going to be a harware fix, though it might be possible to disabled it at the RTL level, but then performance would be some where on the low side of dire as far as many would consider&#8230;</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, security gets harder and harder as you go down the computing stack. You get to a point below which security is not possible, ironically due to the lack of complexity. Simple components all the way up to the equivalent of the old 74 &#8220;MSI&#8221; level (2^8 gate equivalents) are not secure or securable on their own. Which puts you at the memory addressing level and down (but below MMU which is kind of the last securiry check before the south pole).</p>
<p>The problem with most security layers is that the lower layers again due to Specmanship / performance are &#8220;marginal&#8221; thus exploitable which is where &#8220;reach around&#8221; attacks such as agumented[1] RowHammer etc can be so devistating.</p>
<p>Expect a lot more such side channel attacks&#8230;</p>
<p>The real question though, &#8220;If I&#8217;ve been warning for more than a decade, then who else knows?&#8221; I&#8217;m not the brightest or best, they supposadly work for certain agencies&#8230;</p>
<p>[1] Basically not only do you do &#8220;out of spec&#8221; activities which would under ordinary circumstances produce somewhat random results, you augment things by synchronizing with other activities. This not only reduces the random but also enables a degree of tailoring to avoid detection systems by looking like other activities.</p>

				<p>@Spining wheel:</p>
<p>David Asher is a well known lier and presenter of false facts to US politicians, who are basically armchair war hawks.</p>
<p>In reality he has no credability, he blew that more than a decade and a half ago. As for his expertise, he has non when it comes to science of any kind. As for his supposed financial accumen, steeling money from other nations appears to be his area as a &#8220;White Collar bank hiest perpetrator.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is when you check his rhetoric, and actions,</p>
<p>1, We attacked Country A.<br />
2, We stole from Country A.<br />
2, It proved embarrasing for US.<br />
3, So we lied about it loudly and repeatedly.<br />
4, Now country A treats the US with deep suspicion.<br />
5, Therefore it must be that country A is planning to murder US women and children in their beds.<br />
6, Make up more nonsense and go to step 1.</p>
<p>The important thing is when you look for verifiable information, it&#8217;s not there in anything he says, none of it is realy verifiable and supposition at best, with a big side order of arm waving and exhortations about what Country A will do next&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s basically sad that people actually believe his nonsense. Mind you, you can always find someone to comment on David Asher and his ludicrously stupid behaviour&#8230; Some go back quite a while,</p>
<p><a href="https://chinamatters.blogspot.com/2007/04/david-ashers-dead-end.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://chinamatters.blogspot.com/2007/04/david-ashers-dead-end.html</a></p>
<p>Oh and his nonsense does not even pass the very basic &#8220;Intelligence Sniff Test&#8221; of two independent sources, because he does not have sources only make believe, but he knows the lullabies certain right wing politicos who likewise have no knowledge of science like to snooze along to. It gives there nonsense credibility or so they think thus they push him into convenient places directly or on a nod. Why do you think he&#8217;s working where he is&#8230; It&#8217;s a form of corruption.</p>

				<p>@SpinningWheel, Barker<br />
I wish I was Wumao. Real ones get paid for their shilling. It is a widely known fact that China is building defences against viral bio-weapons. One of those teams went to West Africa and developed a vaccine against Ebola in about the same time Pfizer took for their Covid19 vaccine. This speed, and the effectiveness of the vaccine caused Western nations to not talk about it.</p>
<p>Why is it assumed that the &#8220;other&#8221; is always our enemy?</p>
<p>@Name witheld<br />
It&#8217;s possible to walk from Guinea to Congo in a lot less than 7 years, especially if you&#8217;re a green monkey. These are a popular &#8220;bush meat&#8221;, and a natural reservoir for ebola.</p>

<p>Mirror neurons are really a thing.</p>
<p>It appears that neither SpinningWheel nor Barker have any.</p>
<p>Ever seen a dog bark at a spinning wheel?</p>
<p>It may be that they are the same person.</p>

				<p>@ Winter, Clive</p>
<p>Usually, if you wait 5 minutes (the batcache timeout), and force reload the page, it will appear.</p>
<p>Usually.  For small values of 5 minutes.</p>
<p>But, not always.</p>
<p>If you have more than 2 links, it will probably go to moderation.</p>
<p>But, sometimes, even with only one link, if it is for some reason the link is deemed &#8216;hot&#8217;, you may get a 429 error.  A day later, it is not deemed &#8216;hot&#8217;.</p>
<p>The 429 error is either a lie or a symptom.  When it happens and you have not been here for over 12 hours, you know something is fishy.</p>
<p>MITM can make your results vary.</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>It may be that they are the same person.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well Barker and Spinning Wheel do have language and style similarity&#8230; Almost as if copied and pasted from a DB.</p>
<p>But the $64,000 question is,</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would they appear together in effect sock puppeting?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are other signs that indicate shared experience prior to both appearing&#8230;</p>
<p>I suspect checking their IP addresses will show up little other than VPN&#8217;s, Tor, or other location hiding / obfuscation etc.</p>

				<p>@ ALL</p>
<p>Reup.  I noted this on earlier article, but this is important.  Especially for small orgs that really have no dedicated admin person.</p>
<p>Or that does have an on-call admin, but they are swamped with other clients.</p>
<p>We are stil looking at over 50K exposed servers.</p>
<p>For those that not have applied the updates, or don’t have someone with the tech skills that understands the process,</p>
<p>Microsoft has a new tool to buy you time. That hopefully someone onsite can understand and run.</p>
<p><a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/15/one-click-microsoft-exchange-on-premises-mitigation-tool-march-2021/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/15/one-click-microsoft-exchange-on-premises-mitigation-tool-march-2021/</a></p>
<p>Microsoft has released a new, one-click mitigation tool, Microsoft Exchange On-Premises Mitigation Tool to help customers who do not have dedicated security or IT teams to apply these security updates. We have tested this tool across Exchange Server 2013, 2016, and 2019 deployments. This new tool is designed as an interim mitigation for customers who are unfamiliar with the patch/update process or who have not yet applied the on-premises Exchange security update.</p>

				<p>@ vas pup</p>
<p>Yes, torture is bass-ackwards.</p>
<p>Lots of evidence that doing the opposite actually leads to better information.</p>
<p>Gitmo should be closed.  Those charged should be processed thru normal court procedure.</p>
<p>That does not mean anything will be learned, because most at Gitmo probably have no information to offer.</p>
<p>And, if they did, they probably have forgotten a lot by now.</p>
<p>Most are just useful fools.</p>
<p>Fascists have to have someone to blame.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never them.</p>

				<p>@ MarkH</p>
<p>Thanks for the comment. I have been following the Covid news from the start, and I did hear people talking about the probable non-respiratory nature of the disease and the term <i>inflammatory</i>&#8211; cytokine storm &#8211;  was being employed more than <i>endothelial</i>, or <i>vascular</i>.</p>
<p>I had never read the original article, though. I imagine  that the media repeating that it is a vascular disease could have helped cause a stronger feeling of urgency in the populace (and it wouldn&#8217;t be a lie, technically). Perhaps the WHO should have made it the (un)official phraseology.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

				<p>Google Nest 2 home device tracks body activity in bed<br />
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56416578" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56416578</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The new Google Nest Hub will track users&#8217; body activity in bed to generate personalized sleep-tracking reports.</p>
<p>The device&#8217;s radar-based scanning technology detects movement, including coughing and snoring, as well as light and temperature changes.</p>
<p>But the new features have been criticized for collecting data when users are &#8220;most vulnerable&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google said the new features had been &#8220;built with privacy in mind” &#8211; and the data collected would not be used to create personalized advertising.</p>
<p>==&gt;Owners can also choose to disable motion tracking and the microphone [do they include REAL kill switch or that is usual cat and mouse game by big IT- VP] and delete any stored data.</p>
<p>Any information gathered &#8211; through movement or audio &#8211; is processed locally on the device, but anonymous &#8220;sleep event data&#8221; is stored on Google&#8217;s cloud server.</p>
<p>&#8216;Spied on&#8217;</p>
<p>But Véliz said: “There are many questions that arise.<br />
&#8220;What will happen to data about your sleep quality?<br />
&#8220;Might it end up in the hands of an insurance company?”<br />
“Google gets most of its revenue from the exploitation of personal data.</p>
<p>===&gt;“Whenever it comes up with a new product, it would be near-sighted to think about it as a product designed for its users.</p>
<p>“It’s only designed for its users to the extent that it can convince people to use the product so that Google can get more data on us.</p>
<p>“Not only are we being heard, tracked, and spied on through our screens, now our bodies will be scanned by Soli.”</p>
<p>Absolutely agree with last statements. Google can get close to zero trust. But that is just my opinion.</p>
<p>Is somebody working for that company, then this quote will apply:<br />
“It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”<br />
  Upton Sinclair</p>

				<p>Mother &#8216;used deepfake to frame cheerleading rivals&#8217;<br />
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56404038" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56404038</a></p>
<p>&#8220;A mother allegedly used explicit deepfake photos and videos to try to get her teenage daughter&#8217;s cheerleading rivals kicked off the team.</p>
<p>===&gt;Raffaela Spone from Pennsylvania, US, reportedly sent the content &#8211; which showed members of the Victory Vipers team &#8220;naked, drinking and smoking&#8221; &#8211; to the coach.</p>
<p>Deepfakes use artificial intelligence to doctor images and videos.</p>
<p>Mrs Spone has been charged with multiple counts of harassment.</p>
<p>She is also accused of sending abusive messages to the team, their parents and owners of the cheerleading gym, using fake phone numbers.</p>
<p>====&gt;Mrs Spone is believed to have used the girls&#8217; social media accounts to generate the deepfake images.</p>
<p>!!!!Detecting deepfakes.</p>
<p>It could soon become easier to detect whether an image has been created using deepfake technology.</p>
<p>==&gt;Scientists at the University at Buffalo have developed a tool that can identify whether an image has been doctored by analyzing light reflections in a person&#8217;s eyes.<br />
<a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2021/03/010.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2021/03/010.html</a></p>
<p>“The two eyes should have very similar reflective patterns because they’re seeing the same thing,&#8221; said Lead author Siwei Lyu.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s something that we don’t typically notice when we look at a face.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow! I guess next victims are celebrities of all type (actresses, politicians, you name it).</p>

<p>re: <i>One Army&#8217;s Torture is another Agency&#8217;s Enhanced Interrogation </i></p>
<p>The definition of &#8220;torture (illegal)&#8221; was re-written in the USA to be &#8220;enhanced interrogation (legal)&#8221;.  This definition is used by the CIA and other LEAs and the now ex-CIA head Gina Haspel was an expert on the definition.</p>

				<p>A potential SARS-CoV-2 variant of interest (VOI) harboring mutation E484K in the Spike protein was identified within lineage B.1.1.33 circulating in<br />
Brazil</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.12.434969v1" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.12.434969v1</a></p>
<p>Summary<br />
The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Brazil was dominated by two lineages designated as B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33. Two SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring mutations at the receptor-binding domain of the Spike (S) protein, designated as lineages P.1 and P.2, evolved within lineage B.1.1.28 and are rapidly spreading in Brazil. Lineage P.1 is considered a Variant of Concern (VOC) because of the presence of multiple mutations in the S protein (including K417T, E484K, N501Y), while lineage P.2 only harbors mutation S:E484K and is considered a Variant of Interest (VOI). Here we report the identification of a new SARS-CoV-2 VOI within lineage B.1.1.33 that also harbors mutation S:E484K and was detected in Brazil between November 2020 and February 2021. This VOI displayed four non-synonymous lineage-defining mutations (NSP3:A1711V, NSP6:F36L, S:E484K, and NS7b:E33A) and was designated as lineage N.9. The VOI N.9 probably emerged in August 2020 and has spread across different Brazilian states from the Southeast, South, North and Northeast regions.</p>
<p>Competing Interest Statement<br />
The authors have declared no competing interest.</p>

				<p>@ Spinning Wheel,</p>
<blockquote><p>New coronavirus variant found in France is undetectable by PCR tests:</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you know what this does for your evidence-less statment of,</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks Wuhan Lab for experimenting with coronaviruses and killing millions of people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Specifically your claim of,</p>
<blockquote><p>They have not found a single animal in the wild native to China that has covid 19.</p></blockquote>
<p>Time to put up or shut up.</p>
<p>Either you have scientifically verifiable evidence or you have nothing.</p>
<p>The fact that a tiny few US blow hards will lie any which way they can to keep war like tension between the US and,</p>
<p>China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia</p>
<p>Has been going on for so many years now, that the US citizens are being bled white by the money being poured into certain vested interests pockets.</p>
<p>The fact you refuse to even think that in fact it&#8217;s the US politico appointees and executive with people like Bolton etc who were formenting as much xenophobic nonsense as they could is actually quite worrying.</p>
<p>The only sensible thing for any nation to do in the face of such xenophobia is to &#8220;not engage&#8221; in anyway, pure and simple.</p>
<p>The fact you chose to read that in your own mind as a sign of guilt is I would suggest a problem at your end.</p>
<p>Produce real evidence or stop being another xenopobic &#8220;idiot&#8221; &#8220;moron&#8221; tilting at windmills.</p>
<p>Oh and by the way, nobody has said it has to be a &#8220;wild animal native to China&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact the first creature suggested was not.</p>
<p>The simple fact is after more than a year there is no independent evidence that any one has put forward. What little evidence claimed there is, does not make it to viable circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p>In fact some scientists doubt not just that it was,</p>
<p>1, A bio-weapon.</p>
<p>Bit also</p>
<p>2, A lab based development.</p>
<p>That is they say that on balance of probability it&#8217;s origin was natural, not cooked up. And the biggest argument in that is the way the virus it&#8217;s self behaves.</p>
<p>So maybe you should be asking why a certain few in the US Government with known war like behaviours are trying to say otherwise?</p>
<p>Till someone comes up with credible evidence, I&#8217;m otherwise sticking to the non political scientific consensus not the politically inspired and persued &#8220;It was the butler wot dunit&#8221;.</p>

<p>Indeed sir, if you look back to the beginning, before WHO declared a pandemic, on this blog you will see @SpaceLifeForm calling to STOP THE PLANES, @Clive calculating that a proper 35 day world-wide lockdown would render the virus extinct. So now I must wave my chopsticks at you: China suppressed it, and timorous western governments who would not use the same methods have instead placed a curse on humanity. Happy?</p>

				<p>SARS-CoV-2 Prion-Like Domains in Spike Proteins Enable Higher Affinity to ACE2:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202003.0422/v1" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202003.0422/v1</a></p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>Currently, the world is struggling with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Prion-like domains are critical for virulence and the development of therapeutic targets; however, the prion-like domains in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome have not been analyzed. In this in silico study, using the PLAAC algorithm, we identified the presence of prion-like domains in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Compared with other viruses, a striking difference was observed in the distribution of prion-like domains in the spike protein, since SARS-CoV-2 was the only coronavirus with a prion-like domain found in the receptor-binding domain of the S1 region of the spike protein. The presence and unique distribution of prion-like domains in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domains of the spike protein is particularly interesting, since although the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S proteins share the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity for ACE2. Finally, we identified prion-like domains in the α1 helix of the ACE2 receptor that interact with the viral receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, the present findings indicate that the identified PrDs in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and ACE2 region that interact with RBD have important functional roles in viral adhesion and entry.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 causes brain inflammation and induces Lewy body formation in macaques:</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 may cause acute respiratory disease, but the infection can also initiate neurological symptoms. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes brain inflammation in the macaque model. An increased metabolic activity in the pituitary gland of two macaques was observed by longitudinal positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT). Post-mortem analysis demonstrated infiltration of T-cells and activated microglia in the brain, and viral RNA was detected in brain tissues from one animal. We observed Lewy bodies in brains of all rhesus macaques. These data emphasize the virus’ capability to induce neuropathology in this nonhuman primate model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. As in humans Lewy body formation is an indication for the development of Parkinson’s disease, this data represents a warning for potential long-term neurological effects after SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<p>Summary<br />
COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 involves multiple organs including cardiovascular, pulmonary and central nervous system. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 infection afflicts diverse organ systems remains challenging1,2. Particularly vexing has been the problem posed by persistent organ dysfunction known as “long COVID,” which includes cognitive impairment3. Here we provide evidence linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to activation of TGF-ß signaling and oxidative overload. One consequence is oxidation of the ryanodine receptor/calcium (Ca2+) release channels (RyR) on the endo/sarcoplasmic (ER/SR) reticuli in heart, lung and brains of patients who succumbed to COVID-19. This depletes the channels of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 causing them to leak Ca2+ which can promote heart failure4,5, pulmonary insufficiency 6 and cognitive and behavioral defects7–9. Ex-vivo treatment of heart, lung, and brain tissues from COVID-19 patients using a Rycal drug (ARM210)10 prevented calstabin2 loss and fixed the channel leak. Of particular interest is that neuropathological pathways activated downstream of leaky RyR2 channels in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients were activated in COVID-19 patients. Thus, leaky RyR2 Ca2+ channels may play a role in COVID-19 pathophysiology and could be a therapeutic target for amelioration of some comorbidities associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

				<p>Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants escape neutralization by vaccine-induced humoral immunity:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00298-1" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00298-1</a></p>
<p>March 12, 2021</p>
<p>Highlights</p>
<p>Numerous variants of SARS-CoV-2 harboring mutations in spike have arisen globally</p>
<p>mRNA vaccines elicit potent neutralizing activity against homologous pseudovirus</p>
<p>Cross-neutralization of strains with receptor binding domain (RBD) mutations is poor</p>
<p>Both RBD and non-RBD mutations mediate escape from vaccine-induced humoral immunity</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Vaccination elicits immune responses capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of these variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 99 individuals that received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines against pseudoviruses representing 10 globally circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. Five of the 10 pseudoviruses, harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.</p>

				<p>@ Cameron’s Shadow,</p>
<blockquote><p>The EMA covid-19 data leak, and what it tells us about mRNA instability </p></blockquote>
<p>There are two parts to that BMJ article.</p>
<p>The first part in effect reflects what is to be expected in a product that needs cryo-temp &#8220;Chill chain&#8221; to remain stable thus viable. It was a concern I expressed when the needed use of such a chill chain first became public. You will note the effective EMA response of &#8216;We don&#8217;t know, the answers are not forth coming and that would normarly be sufficient to say NO, but it&#8217;s the only defence we have in an emergancy so we will let it pass&#8230;&#8217;.</p>
<p>This what we will do and alow in an energancy that we would not otherwise, is a subject of concern that was brought up on this blog a few days ago.</p>
<p>BUT, the second half is the one that has caused me concern since I first started taking a look at the mRNA jabs. That is what happens to all the man made bits after the mRNA has infected your body cells like a virus?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a subject area nobody is talking about at all publicly, and many who should know are avoiding like a plague it&#8217;s self&#8230;</p>
<p>Again it&#8217;s a question that I&#8217;ve been looking for answers to for some time.</p>

				<p>@ Anders,</p>
<blockquote><p>Radiological images confirm ‘COVID-19 can cause the body to attack itself’ </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Colour me unsurprised&#8221; I&#8217;ve kind of been expecting an auto-immune response or similar for quite some time, even before &#8220;Long COVID&#8221; became a name for similar.</p>
<p>What seems like many years ago now the term &#8220;yuppie flu&#8221; came about. In part because of a nastier than average flu and in part due to the machismo &#8220;work through it&#8221; attitude prevelant at the time.</p>
<p>I myself thinking back then I was young and invincible used to &#8220;burn through flu&#8221; by vigorous exercise&#8230; Yes six months of hell later my Dr was going to add me to the list of &#8220;yuppie flu&#8221; sufferers. In a way I was lucky in that my symptoms started to clear up, but it was a long road, and also the first signs of the very odd collection of chronic illnesses I&#8217;ve now got.</p>
<p>So cause and effect or coincidence? I don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;d urge everyone that gets a viral illness to treat it with rather more seriousness than we have done in the past. When the Dr says rest, they are not kindly giving you a few days &#8220;sicky&#8221; they may be adding years to your healthy life.</p>

				<p>@Clive, Winter, re mRNA degradation:</p>
<p>Disclaimer: My knowledge of this stuff would legibly fit on a postage stamp, so I&#8217;m offering questions more than answers.</p>
<p>Observation: People with knowledge orders of magnitude greater than ours are thinking (knowledgeably) about how things can go wrong.</p>
<p>Winter, the wording of Clive&#8217;s concern suggests to me that he was writing not about free mRNA, but mRNA that made it into host cells.</p>
<p>So, to my questions:</p>
<p>1, Don&#8217;t human cells spend much of their lifetimes with mRNA within them, for the necessary processes of protein synthesis?</p>
<p>2, If the maximum time before degradation of human mRNA is a few hours to a few days, how can we survive for decades if our cells lack highly effective mechanisms for scavenging and/or ignoring (in software terms, refusing to execute) remnants of degraded mRNA?</p>
<p>3, In the lifespan of an average person, probably billions of cells are converted by &#8220;common cold&#8221; viruses alone into virus replication factories, creating non-human mRNA as part of the process.  What is the basis to suppose that mRNA degradation from novel vaccines might cause more harm than the mRNA from rhinovirus infections?</p>
<p>4, The Covid mRNA vaccines cause the manufacture of a single protein.  Is the degradation of a comparatively short mRNA sequence more likely, or less likely, to cause sinister effects than the mRNA to manufacture a whole bloody virus?</p>
<p>================</p>
<p>I suspect that the normal processes of life, infections, proto-cancers, immune system responses, lesions, and wound healing generate astronomical quantities and varieties of rubbish molecules, many of which must be randomly broken fragments of larger coded structures.</p>
<p>Our species seems to be pretty good at homeostasis.  If we weren&#8217;t, how could my grandpa have remained alive more than 3.3 Gs (gigaseconds)?</p>

				<p>Regarding lipid nanoparticles that are used to cover the mRNA:</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the years, researchers attempted to resolve intrinsic instability by encapsulating mRNA in nanocarriers made of polymers, lipids, or inorganic materials. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were chosen by Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, CureVac, and Imperial College London for their covid-19 vaccines. This has attracted the attention of specialists in the field of pharmaceutical biotechnology, some of whom have raised concerns about further unknowns.</p>
<p>In a rapid response posted on bmj.com, JW Ulm, a gene therapy specialist who has published on tissue targeting of therapeutic vectors,13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n627#ref-13" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n627#ref-13</a></p>
<p>raised concerns about the biodistribution of LNPs: “At present, relatively little has been reported on the tissue localisation of the LNPs used to encase the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-encoding messenger RNA, and it is vital to have more specific information on precisely where the liposomal nanoparticles are going after injection.”14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n627#ref-14" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n627#ref-14</a></p>
<p>It is an unknown that Ulm worries could have implications for vaccine safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regarding the EMA Leak:</p>
<p>The email identified “a significant difference in % RNA integrity/truncated species” between the clinical batches and proposed commercial batches—from around 78% to 55%. The root cause was unknown and the impact of this loss of RNA integrity on safety and efficacy of the vaccine was “yet to be defined,” the email said.</p>
<p>RNA instability is one of the biggest hurdles for researchers developing nucleic acid based vaccines. It is the primary reason for the technology’s stringent cold chain requirements and has been addressed by encapsulating the mRNA in lipid nanoparticles (box).</p>
<p>“The complete, intact mRNA molecule is essential to its potency as a vaccine,” professor of biopharmaceutics Daan J.A. Crommelin and colleagues wrote in a review article in The Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences late last year. “Even a minor degradation reaction, anywhere along a mRNA strand, can severely slow or stop proper translation performance of that strand and thus result in the incomplete expression of the target antigen.”6</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n627#ref-6" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n627#ref-6</a></p>
<p>Crommelin and colleagues note that specific regulatory guidance for mRNA based vaccines has yet to be developed, and The BMJ’s attempts to clarify current standards were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>T he BMJ asked Pfizer, Moderna, and CureVac, as well as several regulators, what percentage mRNA integrity they consider acceptable for vaccines against covid-19. None offered any specifics.</p>
<p>In subsequent correspondence, FDA, EMA, and Canadian government department Health Canada all stated that specific information related to the acceptability criteria is confidential.</p>
<p>&#8230;. but all agencies declined to share with The BMJ any specifics on grounds that such information was commercially sensitive.</p>
<p>The mRNA is composed of synthetic uracil nucleotides. The uracil in the pfizer mRNA vaccine is synthetic. This is done to prevent it&#8217;s degradation and to enhance protein folding and export.<br />
The body might degrade naturally occurring mRNA, but what will happen with this synthetic mRNA and how will it disrupt normal cell function is to be determined.</p>
<p>Reverse Engineering the source code of the BioNTech/Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine</p>
<p><a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/</a></p>
<p>Imho it doesn&#8217;t get degraded the same way.</p>
<p>The synthetic uracil is precisely added to help improve stability (ie to keep it from being rapidly degraded). It also allows one strand of mRNA to be read multiple times.</p>
<p>Because some people will still insist otherwise, it&#8217;s quite a contradiction to claim that it will be treated normally when it is precisely placed there to not have it be treated normally &#8211; ie to evade the usual rapid degradation.</p>
<p>How the loss of RNA integrity affects the safety and efficacy of the vaccine has not been defined.</p>
<p>Furthermore there is no regulatory guidance for RNA vaccines that has been developed and the information is considered commercially sensitive and confidential.</p>
<p>The only scientific and rational thing to do is to wait and see the data on long-term effects.</p>
<p>The FDA itself stated that vaccine-enhanced disease resulting from this vaccine is unknown.</p>

				<p>@Cameron&#8217;s shadow<br />
&#8220;The only scientific and rational thing to do is to wait and see the data on long-term effects.&#8221;</p>
<p>There have never been any long-term side effects seen from the mRNA trials against cancer decades ago.</p>
<p>Given the fact that the occurrence of long term side effects of vaccines in general are much much more rare than the death rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections, combined with the near certainty of infection, I disagree about the &#8220;rational&#8221; strategy here.</p>

<blockquote><p>As free RNA always comes from viruses, </p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the mRNA, that&#8217;s almost the smallest part of the worry. If you read the second part of the BMJ article under,</p>
<p>&#8220;Lipid nanoparticles—where do they go and what do they do?&#8221;</p>
<p>You will find that J.W. Ulm, a gene therapy specialist, has some serious concerns about these, LNPs</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;At present, relatively little has been reported on the tissue localisation of the LNPs used to encase the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-encoding messenger RNA, and it is vital to have more specific information on precisely where the liposomal nanoparticles are going after injection.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>They are after all just as much foreign substances that should not be in the human body, thus there is a high probability they will have an effect on the human immune system. Thus the question &#8220;What effect, good, indiferent or bad?&#8221;.</p>
<p>As for the mRNA, perhaps people should consider what they do to the human cells as well and the implications in the likes of auto-immune diseases.</p>
<p>As the article notes for various reasons mRNA has been a failure for three decades or more. As such it&#8217;s failed to ever get past lab prototyping tests, and cost vast fortunes in the process. Some people are quite naturally asking why?</p>
<p>Well unlike more traditional vaccines that have a more than half an average lifetime on the &#8220;Phase IV&#8221; testing clock thus are a fairly well understood quantity as far as long term effects in safety and efficacy are concerned&#8230; We just do not have that for these new mRNA jabs for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>But worse as some feared they were also rushed through under &#8220;Emergancy usage&#8221; with many normal precautions waived to go from in silico, through in vitro to in vivo with curtailed testing and no peer reviewed publication. Thus some started asking &#8220;wood pile&#8221; questions. The obvious question of course is &#8220;If such tests are necessary why? And if they are not carried out in an emergancy what will potentially be missed?&#8221;. Well from the EMA documents leak, it would appear stability thus longevity as a viable jab is one such thus the obvious question &#8220;How many more?&#8221;</p>
<p>But all of that asside I made a choice, and it&#8217;s been questioned a couple of times. So to answer it again before it gets brought up again.</p>
<p>If I was in my seventies or eighties, I would not realy care about &#8220;long term effects&#8221; as my ordinary life expectancy would be comparable. But I&#8217;m not I&#8217;m younger I&#8217;ve atleast 20 years still on the average mileage for where I live. Auto-immune diseases start showing effects after a number of years diabetes takes around a decade to become noticable to an individuak for instance. Thus if a long term auto-immune effect did turn up I&#8217;d be at that awkward age where the &#8220;healthcare&#8221; you would get if you were 60 or younger gets denied for various reasons hence the &#8220;DNR Scandle&#8221; in the UK. So I&#8217;m in an age trap, so as a more known vaccine became available whilst I was still waiting for my turn to come around I expressed a prefrence that was granted to me of going for a traditional vaccine that was in most parts a known quantity unlike the mRNA jabs.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m in no way saying the mRNA jabs are dangerous now or in the future, or that they are ineffective. What I am saying is that they are questions for which we currently have no answers, unlike the more traditional vaccines where we have indicative answers.</p>
<p>Thus my choice, go with the totally unknown or go with the better understood? But also bearing in mind that if it went wrong I would be at an age where the healthcare would at best be short term palliative not curative. Thus the known risks so far favour the more traditional vaccines for me, hence my choice.</p>
<p>I could be wrong or just too conservative but that was my choice, at least I had a choice, I considered it and I made it. I will live or die by that choice, only time will tell which.</p>
<p>But it brings up another interesting point&#8230; If the mRNA jab was the only thing available would I have taken it? Yes and without hesitation, I might not like the long term risks being unknown but the short term risk of not taking it are well known and would be a lot lot worse for me.</p>
<p>How about in the future? Well it depends on the risk yet again. If I have the misfortune to develop cancer or other disease that has known short term fatality risk would I take an mRNA cure? Don&#8217;t be daft of course I would.</p>
<p>So no I&#8217;m not anti-vax or anything like that, I just know what my odds are under certain circumstances, thus I go with what I have the evidence for. Even if it may turn out later I was wrong in some way, I have to go where the information available now leads me, otherwise I would not be acting rationally.</p>
<p>How other people chose to go if given a choice is upto them, their choice if they get given one. My advice examin the most current peer reviewed scientific information available on,</p>
<p>1, Short term safety.<br />
2, Short term efficacy.<br />
3, Long term safety.<br />
4, Long term efficacy.</p>
<p>Oh and do not fall for politically inspired nonsense similar to that which has recently been pushed in the EU. The actual results show the opposit of what is being claimed, even the EMA know that&#8230; So more people will die in Europe, and the US Gov and certain US MSM make more profit as the politicians danced to their tune.</p>
<p>At the moment we realy only have specific information on the short term safety/efficacy and it does not appear on balance to favour mRNA jabs over Oxford Astra Zenica. We have some indicative information for more traditional vaccines in the long term but not in any way for the mRNA jabs.</p>
<p>But complicating things is the pathogen mutations that are now comming in &#8220;fast and furious&#8221; due to the high prevelance due to &#8220;leadership failure&#8221; (for which I feel very sorry for Brazil). Especially by those who hold science in low esteem compared to their own whims, failings, and who is paying them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always tried where I can give my reasons for what I&#8217;ve said and why and given the evidence on which it is based. But I also have another view point in life,</p>
<p>&#8220;Individual Rights -v- Social Responsability&#8221;</p>
<p>I live in a society and I enjoy the benifits of living in a society and thus it would be wrong for me not to consider my &#8220;Responsabilities to society.</p>
<p>Some hold these views in contempt or as some kind of attack on their inalienable &#8220;Rights&#8221;. Well the honest answer if you feel that way is to first answer the questiin of,</p>
<p>&#8220;What rights do you have that the society you share has not given you?&#8221;</p>
<p>To which when you think about it the answer is effectively &#8220;none&#8221;. If I drop you naked in a place where humans are not habituating, how long do you realy think you will survive? With no fire, cutting edge or way to gather water, or other of those things we use every day without thought of what we would do with out them. How about your whole family how would they fair and how would you cope with what is in effect a social responsability towards them?</p>
<p>This is not a new point for me to make, I have been doing so for over a decade or so about healthcare. To be healthy as an individual you have to live in a healthy society forget all the political nonsense by which others profit enormously at your expense. The one thing this pandemic should make clear to all but the most idiotic of mantra believing idiots is that sick people make others sick and some of those die needlessly as a result.</p>
<p>Why do you think the self proclaimed &#8220;exceptional&#8221; are stealing vaccine opportunities from the rest of society in the US and other places? Because they know that those mantra&#8217;s are for idiots to believe so they can be subjugated, fleeced or both and discarded at whim.</p>
<p>Poor health kills not just the sick but the soon to be sick in the rest of society disease is nor respector of status, power, weakth or class, one warm body is as good as the next, especially with COVID. So if you want to live then stop all in society getting sick where you can. It&#8217;s called proactive self defence. It involves both short term and long term thinking and actions.</p>

<p>Because the mRNA gets cleared too fast to be of use. Which is a bug for most applications, but a feature when you are talking about vaccines.</p>
<p>As for all kinds of hypothetical side-effects, with 400 million of shots already given, the count of serious side effects is very, very low:<br />
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/</a></p>
<p>(cannot find a break-down for the different vaccines)</p>
<p>I am afraid most of these &#8220;reports&#8221; are FUD.</p>

&#8220;After what 8-12 weeks, hardly “long term” which kind of starts at a couple of years at the earliest and goes out to a quater to half a century for adults.&#8221;</p>
<p>mRNA trials have been recorded from 2005. Long term risks should have surfaced by now.</p>
<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-72167-3_11" rel="nofollow ugc">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-72167-3_11</a></p>

<p>If you are referring to the details of this particular vaccine, then you have no more reason to doubt it than to doubt any new formulation of any pill or injection.</p>
<p>As always, if you take any medication you should weight the risks of taking it against the risks of not taking it. And in this case, all the vaccines are new and have not had any long term evaluation.</p>

<p>re: <i>Where does it go when it gets into your body </i></p>
<p>fwiw: One aspect that eludes some folks when they consider the effects of any drug or vaccine, it the &#8220;target&#8221; portion.</p>
<p>Such items are intended to GoThere but NotThatThere.  Theses actually just circulate around your body until they find &#8220;SomeWhere&#8221; that matches up with their chemical bond links.  They don&#8217;t really have any street address or zipcodes.</p>
<p>RL anecdote: tl;dr</p>
<p>During the flu season, long after getting the flu shot for that year, I had &#8220;vaccine failure&#8221;: eg I got the flu. Except I didn&#8217;t realize I had the flu, because I didn&#8217;t have any symptoms common to the flu.</p>
<p>What I got was a &#8220;skin rash&#8221;.  Except it wasn&#8217;t itchy or raised.</p>
<p>After visiting my PCP, they explained the virus had targeted my skin cells and the effects would disappear after the common duration of the flu.</p>
<p>It was rather spectacular, watching the virus march across the skin, leaving tiny pinpoints of red dots in the infected cells (antibody response).  Having teeny red polka dots tattooed everywhere brought some insight:</p>
<p>&emsp; <b> The first open door, is the first door entered. </b></p>
<p>Maybe that mRNA vaccines(1) are smarter than influenza virus, or have better (or lesser) chemical structures that won&#8217;t connect to something with stronger chemical bond but the stronger bond will win.</p>
<p>1, Until recently only mRNA vaccines were available in the USA.</p>
<p>ht tps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza</p>
<p>ht tps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound<br />
ht tps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#Biotechnology</p>
<p>ht tps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAC_nomenclature_of_organic_chemistry</p>
<blockquote><p> Although organic compounds make up only a small percentage of the Earth&#8217;s crust, they are of central importance because all known life is based on organic compounds. Living things incorporate inorganic carbon compounds into organic compounds through a network of processes (the carbon cycle) that begins with the conversion of carbon dioxide and a hydrogen source like water into simple sugars and other organic molecules by autotrophic organisms using light (photosynthesis) or other sources of energy.<br />
&#8230;<br />
Many organic compounds—two examples are ethanol and insulin—are manufactured industrially using organisms such as bacteria and yeast. Typically, the DNA of an organism is altered to express compounds not ordinarily produced by the organism. Many such biotechnology-engineered compounds did not previously exist in nature.

&#8220;The mRNA is composed of synthetic uracil nucleotides. The uracil in the pfizer mRNA vaccine is synthetic. This is done to prevent it’s degradation and to enhance protein folding and export.<br />
The body might degrade naturally occurring mRNA, but what will happen with this synthetic mRNA and how will it disrupt normal cell function is to be determined.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pfizer&#8217;s mRNA uses methyl pseudouracil io uracil. In this it looks like a tRNA, which also uses pseudouracil.</p>
<p><a href="https://kevinfolta.medium.com/anatomy-of-the-pfizer-covid19-mrna-vaccine-eb29beff7aa3" rel="nofollow ugc">https://kevinfolta.medium.com/anatomy-of-the-pfizer-covid19-mrna-vaccine-eb29beff7aa3</a></p>
<p>Such substitutions are nothing &#8220;new&#8221;. Many viruses and bacteria use such tricks. If it was as effective as the FUD claims, we would have been swamped by viruses and bacteria that use this trick.</p>
<p>It just means the mRNA has a longer half life. It still is cleared pretty fast. Too fast, indeed, to be useful against cancer.</p>

<blockquote><p>mRNA trials have been recorded from 2005. Long term risks should have surfaced by now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Err we are not talking about small trials in healthy people, nor are we talking about just the mRNA but the whole jab.</p>
<p>The mRNA is carried in an artificial lipid capsid, of which little or nothibg is known and even less is being said about. In turn these capsids are in a carrier medium that needs certain unusual properties due to the extream nature of the chill chain.</p>
<p>We already know that people have had unfortunate adverse reactions to chemicals in the carrier medium.</p>
<p>There is nothing realy &#8220;forged in nature&#8221; or &#8220;honed and tempered by evolution&#8221; about these over priced mRNA jabs. And nobody is talking about them other to mention in large scale trial they are proving less effective than the Oxford AZ vaccine. Where your risk of hospitalisation from being infected by a SARS-CoV-20 varient is a little more than two and a half times worse with the Pfizer vaccine after the first injection</p>
<p>As I said I had a choice in which shot I got I chose Oxford AZ vaccine over the Pfizer jab and,so far I&#8217;ve no cause to regret that choice, either personally or by peer revieued data.</p>
<p>Like others I&#8217;m going to wait and see what happens.</p>

<p>Yes indeed, but this is not specific for mRNA vaccines. Vaccinations with AstraZenica are currently suspended in many countries due to possible serious adverse effects.</p>
<p>Carrier driven adverse effects have been noted in all kinds of vaccines, and other drugs (cf, the narcolepsy from an influenca H1N1 vaccine in 2009). There have even been deaths from overdoses of the adenoviruses used in common vaccines (in a gene therapy trial).</p>
<p>Many drugs need special formulations for all kinds of reasons. This is something all pharmaceutical companies know and work with. There is absolutely nothing really that sets these mRNA vaccines apart.</p>
<p>I can understand your reservations about a completely new vaccine, but there is currently zero science or data that supports your fears that mRNA vaccines are more dangerous than the &#8220;regular&#8221; ones.</p>

				<p>@ Winter, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>Vaccinations with AstraZenica are currently suspended in many countries due to possible serious adverse effects.</p></blockquote>
<p>The information so far made available does not make sense because,</p>
<p>1, The story appears to be driven by a certain US MSM outlet.</p>
<p>2, It&#8217;s claimed to be a general thrombotic effect.</p>
<p>3, The rate given per vaccination given is well below the expected average over the same time period within the general population without vaccination.</p>
<p>4, The expected death rate per day of not vacinating far far exceeds this less than average thrombosis embolism risk.</p>
<p>5, It&#8217;s been said but there are no figures released that the mRNA jabs are showing higher incidence of thrombotic events than the Astra Zenica vaccine.</p>
<p>6, European Governments are still blocking the export of the AZ vaccine to keep it for themselves.</p>
<p>That is on the information made public so far (2,3) you could argue that the Oxford AZ vaccine is actualy reducing general thrombotic risk. But more importantly (4) it is very significantky reducing the fatality risk by thrombosis which is one of the major causes of death with COVID.</p>
<p>Further why would EU countries still be using Pfizer etc (5) and still be putting blocks on the export (6) of legaly ordered and paid for AZ Vaccine to countries outside of the EU?</p>
<p>Which means one of two things,</p>
<p>A, Somebody is trying to create a &#8220;tempest in a teapot&#8221; story for some political reason (which the Italian Health Minister has indicated).</p>
<p>B, What ever the thrombotic risk may be the much lower than normal events suggests it is not a general risk but of a very specific much rarer nature, such that it is probably a very low occurance adverse drug or environmental factor reaction, or possibly occurs only in those that have had COVID or are suffering from it with low or no real symptoms.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had both thrombotic incidents causing DVT&#8217;s, and the embolisms/strokes of them breaking up via PE&#8217;s, CE&#8217;s and TIA&#8217;s as I&#8217;ve mentioned in the past, to this date they still do not know what caused mine, and the list of things they went through was long (it&#8217;s why the general risk is 10 in a million per month in Europe and worse in other parts of the world). It&#8217;s why they have me jacked up on blood thiners of various types, which now appear to have caused further issues with my heart (currently under investigation). I&#8217;ve had my first shot of Oxford AZ and as promised I would reveal any symptoms I&#8217;ve had, which is as I&#8217;ve said so far a mild ache at the injection site on the Wednesday PM following the Saturday AM injection.</p>
<p>Whilst the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had made an OK to Carry on Using pronouncment on AZ already,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-56411561" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-56411561</a></p>
<p>It appears they will be having talks with The WHO and making another anouncment today.</p>
<p>So &#8220;watch this space&#8221;.</p>
<p>Oh one snipit that has been said but I&#8217;ve not found conformation on is that the thrombosis sufferers are all women of middle age or slightly younger (HealthCare workers? EU is only down to 70&#8217;s at best for general population vaccination).</p>
<p>If that is true, it might be a very rare adverse reaction to hormone based medications, which in the past have been noted for rare thrombotic issues. Such events are sufficiently rare that the odds of them showing up during Phase II &amp; III testing would be vanishingly small.</p>

<p>re: Bank of Mom and Dad<br />
COVID-19 Post Wave 2 Blanket Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Orders in the UK</p>
<p>Previous posts have documented the use of DNR orders to deny persons treatment for COVID-19 (1)</p>
<p>MSM article on the findings of the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in the UK document the increased filings of DNR on persons in care homes.</p>
<ul>
<li>DNR in place increased from 16,876 to 26,555 persons.  An additional 9,679 persons tagged in blanket orders denying care for COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the families were lucky to receive a note about the DNR it read in part:</p>
<ul>
<li>after looking at the medical notes and using a <b>computer algorithm</b></li>
</ul>
<p>A computer algorithm?</p>
<p>The TRIAGE/SOFA score system requires specific entries for determination about continuing care for that person.  Age is a Not to be Used although it sneaks in under another scoring area.</p>
<p>DNRs allow MDs to by pass the TRIAGE/SOFA scores and just stop treatment.</p>
<p>In the USA, the DNRs are normally issued with the understanding that &#8220;normal medical, specialty medical&#8221; would be given but not &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; procedures.</p>
<p>The usage of DNRs to deny care for COVID-19 was not widely publicized by the medical professions.  In the USA, retracting one is difficult or near impossible.(2)</p>
<p>1, previous analysis on the value of the Bank of Mom and Dad can be found in the blog archives or perhaps on the Wayback Machine.</p>

<p>These viruses are not even related. Rabies is a Rhabdovirus, HIV is a Retrovirus, and neurotoxin is just a label. Nothing to do with Coronaviruses.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had enough. I&#8217;m gonna rape someone. It won&#8217;t be in the weekend cause I&#8217;ll be busy but it&#8217;ll probably be somewhere around next week.</p>
<p>If i think you look decently cute, I&#8217;m raping you.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care if your 6 ft 6 boyfriend is with you, I&#8217;m raping you anyways. I&#8217;m weak as shit but i WILL figure out a way.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care if your dad is with you, I&#8217;m raping you infront of him. I don&#8217;t care if your mom&#8217;s with you, I&#8217;ll rape you and then I&#8217;ll rape your mom.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care if your sister is with you, I&#8217;ll rape you and your sister, if your mum is there too then I&#8217;ll rape you, your mum and your sister. Threesome rape type shit.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care if a cop is next to you, a 100 people could be surrounding you and i will still be raping you.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t make any exceptions either, no matter the race, nationality or age. I will still rape you if i think you&#8217;re cute.</p>
<p>Matter of fact, you could be male but if i think you&#8217;re feminine and cute i will rape you too.</p>
<p>You could be 9 years old and I&#8217;d still rape you.</p>
<p>So, anyone living in Belgium specifically in the &#8220;Oost-Vlaanderen&#8221; province, you better make yourself as ugly as possible in the course of the next week if you don&#8217;t wanna be raped.</p>

<p>Life under the bridge realy has reduced your outlook, so sad. Maybe one day you will have the ability to think beyond the end of your proboscis. But I realy don&#8217;t think people are going to wait for you to reach an epiphany of realisation of just how easy you are to make demeaning fun out of, they will just demonstrate. But you will no doubt get an inkling eventually of how lowly you are regarded when you read this.</p>
<p>Then most can predict how you will respond and then smile with a knowing nod when you do.</p>
<p>So climb back in that dank, dark, drainage hole you infest and actually let your brain function befor you drop down and spew out of the Cloaca Maxima you think is so grand.</p>

				<p>@ Winter,</p>
<blockquote><p>How is this different for the mRNA scare?</p></blockquote>
<p>An interesting question, it depends on how you want to look at it.</p>
<p>We can now say as I suspected that the Oxford AZ scare was almost &#8220;Fake News&#8221;, the evidence as claimed was not there for general thrombotic events such as DVT&#8217;s leading to PE&#8217;s etc. In fact the opposite, it showed a reduction against pre COVID levels.</p>
<p>As for what COVID pandemic thrombotic event levels have become, I suspect as it&#8217;s a major feature in the disease that even in what are asymptotic and presymptomatic infections they will have increased probably by a significant factor. Thus making any potential reduction effect the Oxford AZ vaccine has had on thrombotic effects rather more pronounced.</p>
<p>Which brings us onto the &#8220;What about Pfizer and mRNA?&#8221;, well the EMA has been immensely tight lipped over the side effects of these jabs. So we can not do &#8220;side by side comparison&#8221; which is actually vitaly important when you are trying to track down rare events.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s been indicated by other sources that broadly you see the same level of thrombotic events as with the Oxford AZ vaccine. So this leaves another big wuestion mark hanging over the EMA that they should explain, they are after all supposed to act,</p>
<p>1, Impartially<br />
2, In the interests of patients</p>
<p>With holding information they have raises questions that can not be brushed away with a trite &#8220;Commercial in Confidence&#8221; or similar excuse.</p>
<p>However at the bottom of this is still the fact that people have died and thus their friends and loved ones are going to want answers to the important,</p>
<p>&#8220;Coincidence or Causation?&#8221;</p>
<p>question. If not coincidence they are going to want know if there is causation and if so by what process.</p>
<p>Based on some information the events in question are less than one in two million, which as I&#8217;ve said is sufficiently rare that it would not have been picked up in Phase III trials.</p>
<p>But we are learning more, whilst still not being formally stated the MSM organisation and others have said &#8220;all women under 55&#8221; or equivalent of the events that happened in Europe.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s known that this is not the case in the UK. Was this the MSM concerned aiming a disinformation campaign at women who are many many more times more likely to protest than men at medical issues or just bad journalism? It has certainly turned into a political storm that with the significantly rising COVID cases and healtcare saturation in Europe has almost certainly caused the deaths of many many people over the next month or so, far more than could have been potentially saved by stopping the use of the Oxford AZ vaccine.</p>
<p>But as I&#8217;ve stated all along what made me decide to go for the Oxford AZ vaccine over any of the mRNA jabs is &#8220;lack of information&#8221; it started withva lack of published and peer reiviewed data and is not getting any better as this recent witholding of data by the EMA continues. Maybe you are happy to &#8220;trust sight unseen&#8221; but I&#8217;m not, thus my personal choice as always was &#8220;To go with the evidence&#8221; which unlike the mRNA jabs was made freely available not just as news releases but as peer reviewed articles in well respected journals by the Oxford AZ vaccine researchers and those running the trials.</p>
<p>But talking about &#8220;successfull Cancer trials&#8221; with mRNA, is not comparing like for like, the cohorts were tiny and the products did not go to market for variois reasons. Thus how many thousand people make up the Phase IIII stage if any are still being run? This scare is on a less than two million to one probability of an event happening, in thirty years mRNA tech prior to the current jabs mRNA has not got even close to being put in a million arms, now they want to put it in billions, so a sensible question would be &#8220;What is going to happen?&#8221;. You might not like it but this Oxford AZ scare is proof that the sensible approach is caution when you have a choice, which I did.</p>
<p>The fact that my choice was almost certainly the right one for society based on other published large cohort data is another consideration to take into account before all the other issues to do with the mRNA jabs.</p>
<p>But my basic advice is still the same if you are offered a legitimate SARS-CoV-2 immunisation injection then take it which ever it is that is in use in West Europe be it based on adenovirus or mRNA then take it. Your risk of sever illness and death drop significantly even though it&#8217;s two and a half times worse with the mRNA jab (16%) than it is with the Oxford AZ adenovirus vaccine (6%) at the four week point after your first injection.</p>

<p>That are less &#8220;victims&#8221; of a possible side-effect of the vaccine than there were lives saved by the vaccine due to people not getting COVID.</p>
<p>Any vaccine or drug will have adverse effects in some people under some circumstances. What counts is whether the damage prevented by the vaccine or drug clearly outweighs the damage done by the vaccine or drug.</p>
<p>And the &#8220;MSM&#8221; mentioned women as victims simply because all the reported cases were from women under 50.</p>

<p>@Barker<br />
I would like to note that &#8220;11 cases per million vaccinated&#8221; is much rarer than the number of people dying from COVID per million infected,and everyone will eventually be infected. Also, the symptoms mentioned do occur also during a normal COVID infection, at around the same rate.</p>
<p>But maybe you are one of those anti-vaxxers that rather have us all die of natural causes?</p>

<p>re: <i> Bank of Mom and Dad<br />
COVID-19 Blanket Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Orders in the UK </i></p>
<p>MSM article (03 19 2021) about the DNR blanket orders in the UK:<br />
<b> &#8220;We doctors must learn from what went wrong with &#8216;do not resuscitate&#8217; orders&#8221;</b></p>
<blockquote><p>
No one is suggesting that any of the medics who, since March last year, signed more than 500 “do not resuscitate” (more accurately, “do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation”) forms without first discussing the matter with the patients or their families had any intention of shortening life<br />
&#8230;<br />
I believe that those rushed, overwhelmed doctors who failed to conduct proper “do not attempt CPR” discussions last year never intended to discriminate, ration treatment or deny care on the basis of arbitrary features such as age. I suspect, rather, that they were trying to avoid patients being subjected to undignified and futile attempts at resuscitation. <b>They were trying, clumsily, to minimise harm. </b>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The MD author has not read up on Herd Immunity Policy, and perhaps has never read anything published about the Economics of the COVID-19-Dead or the pronouncements from Anders Tegnell, which lately have been short of HIP and long on &#8220;Oh&#8230; Wells&#8230;&#8221;.</p>
<p>HIP is precisely about removing expensive and long term &#8220;drains on the economy&#8221;.</p>
<p>The question for those at, near, or approaching the &#8220;drainage pipe&#8221; is whether your own Primary Care Physician (PCP) or an anonymous one, had filed a DNR on Your Behalf.</p>

<p>Can someone explain how more police will stop crime? Unless you are talking about an actual police state, how do police stop crime? They don&#8217;t, and they never have. Police respond to crime, they don&#8217;t prevent it. In a country with so many libertarians who want small government over everything else, the fact that we allow EVERY police officer in the country the ability to not only ruin your life &#8211; at will, but to literally end your life if they think you are a threat in any way whatsoever, is complete and total bullshit. Our police have way too much power. Our police departments have way too much power. If you want to end crime, you need to address what leads to it. End poverty, get everyone educated, a decent well paying job, end the drug war. More police will only create a police state, but it sounds like a lot of you want that.</p>

<p>That is not completely accurate. The police cannot kill you just like that if you are White and not poor. If you are black or poor, they can indeed kill you without a problem.</p>
<p>Which should suggest why this is tolerated.</p>

&#8220;Maybe, just maybe, when they have and witness vaccine injuries will they realize that those who have already been affected, asking questions and being cautious were trying to help them and their children in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have seen the yearly newspaper stories about the children dying from measles, or the children who lost their hearing or fertility due to some virus. And, of course, all the people who were paralyzed by poliomyelitis. All because there was no vaccine, or their parents did not want you to fer it.</p>
<p>Then you do the math about side-effects.</p>
<p>More than 140,000 died of measles in 2018. A disease easily prevented by a cheap vaccine.<br />

				<p>@All</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that the AI bot has finally reached its self-training end point.  The AI Data Set has now refined itself down to one word.  Probably the most common one located in the training set found by recursive algorithm.</p>
<p>ht tps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency<br />
ht tps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis</p>
<blockquote><p>
Frequency analysis is based on the fact that, in any given stretch of written language, certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying frequencies. Moreover, there is a characteristic distribution of letters that is roughly the same for almost all samples of that language. For instance, given a section of English language, E, T, A and O are the most common, while Z, Q, X and J are rare. Likewise, TH, ER, ON, and AN are the most common pairs of letters (termed bigrams or digraphs), and SS, EE, TT, and FF are the most common repeats.[1] The nonsense phrase &#8220;ETAOIN SHRDLU&#8221; represents the 12 most frequent letters in typical English language text.
</p></blockquote>

				<p>@Moderator:</p>
<p>It would appear that the below bridge deck dwelling creature is back yet again.</p>
<p>And it is becoming clear that it is using not just the handles of existing longterm posters but new handles as well.</p>
<p>This tends to reinforce the suggestion that the target is actually the blog, and so in turn it&#8217;s owner.</p>
<p>The apparent mainly &#8216;Childish Nature&#8217; of the attacks I would say is deliberately effected, rather than inate. In effect following a scripted behaviour that has been suggest by some half humorously as a failed attempt at making an AI Bot.</p>
<p>The reason for this cyclical scripted behaviour is becoming more apparent with time and apparently arises from the persona&#8217;s disparity between how the world actually perceives them and how they think they should be perceived and are obviously not. But not so much a &#8220;Walter Mitty&#8221; more a &#8220;Tom Ripley&#8221; by action but without the looks, charm, patience, or intelligence to carry it forward.</p>
<p>Thus I guess the question arises as to where the script goes next and what source will be used as the basis of the tracts of texts used.</p>
