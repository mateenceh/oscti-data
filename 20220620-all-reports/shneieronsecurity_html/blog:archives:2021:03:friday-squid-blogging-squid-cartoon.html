				<blockquote><p>When Oxford University was working on a COVID-19 vaccine it announced that it would be made &#8220;open source&#8221;, meaning that any pharmaceutical manufacturer would be able to produce it legally without infringement on any drug patent, which would make the vaccine more widely available and less expensive, enabling widespread vaccination of the economically destitute populations in developing countries. But after their announcement that they would make the vaccine free to produce, they received immense pressure from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (wherein Oxford research staff were threatened with the reduction or elimination of all grants from the Foundation, not limited only to those for medical research) to patent the vaccine and partner with AstraZeneca to sell it. So, now, not only did AstraZeneca receive all the accolades for &#8220;developing&#8221; a vaccine (which the company did not do), it&#8217;s also being produced in limited quantities and sold for $4 per dose to the federal government, which is about 20 times more expensive than the estimated cost if the formula had been open source and allowed to be mass produced by any manufacturer with the required equipment. In addition, because it is patented, it can only be produced by AstraZeneca, and poor countries have no or limited access to inexpensive vaccines.</p>
<p>Why did you do that, Bill?</p></blockquote>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm, Bruce, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>have found two undocumented x86 instructions in Intel CPUs which completely control microarchitectural state (yes, they can modify microcode)</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh well it was to be expected eventually.</p>
<p>What was in theory, now anyone who can,</p>
<p>1, Get information on to your computer.<br />
2, Can get the information run as code.<br />
3, Owns the microcode interpreter in the CPU.<br />
4, Can do anything the wiring between the registers alows.<br />
5, Including those hidden test harnesses.</p>
<p>So those,&#8221;write only registers&#8221; you find tucked away in crypto co-pros etc now become read/write. I also hear that Intel are using RC4 to encrypt the info blocks not AES&#8230; In effect code signing on the very cheap.</p>
<p>So Major embarrassment for Intel, yet again.</p>
<p>What do you think is going to happen to their stock price this time 😉</p>
<p>But from a practical point of view I guess the cold hard reality is security of the average computer is not going to be realy effected by this.</p>
<p>And even those few computers Level III attackers are going to go after are not realy any worse off with respect to &#8220;being attacked&#8221;&#8230; But those writing ISA or above code to look for such microcode &#8220;root code&#8221; are going to have a much harder time of it.</p>
<p>I suspect the real winners if Intel do not close this problem out, are going to be games and specialised software writers who will be able to get algorithms one step closer to the hardware, but there will be all sorts of thermal managment issues involved.</p>

				<p>It is said (<em>e.g.</em>, by a <em>The New Yorker</em> reporter) that Donald Trump faces a high risk of prosecution and conviction in New York and could be sentenced to prison. There are persistent reports that people close to him believe he would flee the country rather than go to prison. If he leaves, where would he go? I imagine Russia. Suppose my speculation is right and he goes there and is accepted. Russia has, I think, a Constitutional ban against extradition. The U.S. would almost certainly pressure Russia to give him up. If so, how would that affect Edward Snowden?</p>

				<p>@ Nick Levinson,</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. would almost certainly pressure Russia to give him up. If so, how would that affect Edward Snowden?</p></blockquote>
<p>We already know the probable answer to this as the US DoJ has been issuing indictments against both China and Russia and all it&#8217;s done is wast time, US tax money, and create amusement for other countries.</p>
<p>Further we know the US will not hand over dangerous drivers who have run over and killed people in foreign countries. And thats before you start talking about US personnel &#8220;under flag&#8221; that have committed all sorts of atrocities entirely unrelated to their duties.</p>
<p>So the probable answer if Mr Trump takes flight to Russia is,</p>
<p>1, The US know that any request will not be &#8220;proper&#8221; and therefore should not be granted.</p>
<p>2, The US will make a big fan fare over issuing the request for the usuall Orwellian &#8220;home crowd&#8221; reasons.</p>
<p>3, The rest of the world will either ignore it or laugh at the US over it.</p>
<p>Mind you there is a difference between Mr Trump and Ed Snowden.</p>
<p>Ed Snowden was traveling &#8220;through Russia&#8221; not &#8220;to Russia&#8221; and would have continued his journey had the US not made him a refugee. Thus his claim for assylum in Russia was legally correct as it was &#8220;the first boarder as a refugee&#8221;. In your senario unless Mr Trump flew directly to Russia then it would not be his &#8220;first boarder&#8221; thus if Russia did not want him they could politely turn him away at the boarder or expel him when his visa expired.</p>
<p>But I can not see Mr Trump wanting to spend the rest of his life in Russia unless he has got a considerable sum of money tucked away there. Mr Trump is basically a narcissist, which means he is going to crave the company of fawning leaders, whilst he was seen as a &#8220;useful fool&#8221; then he would have got his ego fed. But as a bankrupt with next to nothing to offer except embarrassing the US he&#8217;s unlikely to get the sort of attention he and Mrs Trump crave in Russia. I suspect even Mr Trump is aware that part of his success in Russia was because he was seen as being under Putin&#8217;s protection thus not only did he not get the attention of certain criminal types, he also got more than his fair share of favours by people looking to improve their position with Putin. Such patronage might be small for Putin but it could easily be a life or death difference for Mr Trump.</p>
<p>Ed Snowden has mentioned some of the security precautions he takes as have journalists who have visited him. To many who don&#8217;t think it through it sounds like paranoia, but Ed knows that &#8220;his coin&#8221; is very small in Russia thus his level of patronage protection is likewise very small. Ed also knows that it is not realy US personnel he has the major worry about. Because as he will be well aware there are quite a few in Russia who might see advantage in sticking a needle in him, putting him bound and gagged in the boot of a car, then a packing crate, and on a journey out of Russia. So his best way to avoid that fate is to be as near impossible to locate as he can make things. Part of which is keeping a very very low profile.</p>
<p>Can you see Mr or Mrs Trump wanting to live that way?</p>

				<p>@Nick Levinson, Clive:</p>
<p>We&#8217;re flying pretty high with this speculation &#8230; or down in the weeds, not sure which &#8230; but I&#8217;ve thought about this a lot.</p>
<p>I expect that 45 (or should I call him .45?) will do absolutely anything to avoid prison, and I think he has options other than fleeing.</p>
<p>If he chose to flee, Russia would be (while Putin lives) a good option.  It would be a tremendous coup for Putin&#8217;s reputational project: he could offer it as proof that he had owned the most powerful leader on Earth.</p>
<p>The refugee would receive one of the most magnificent houses in the Moscow region (which are very fine indeed), and a mild-weather palace by the Black Sea for winters.  He would be feted, given medals and titles, and be (for a while at least) as much a celebrity as he&#8217;s always wanted to be.  I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if he were given the rank of General in one of the intelligence services.</p>
<p>There might be a <em>pro forma</em> diplomatic request to surrender him, but it wouldn&#8217;t mean anything to either Russia or the U.S.</p>
<p>The danger of his having any further influence on U.S. politics would be immediately and permanently ended.</p>
<p>On the other side, he would surely give up any and all national security secrets he hasn&#8217;t already disclosed.</p>
<p>The greatest risk of such a strategem would be that if he (a) outlives Putin, and (b) Putin&#8217;s successor wants to maximize constructive engagement with the West, he might be surrendered after all &#8230;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no question at all concerning his Mrs.  If he fled, he would go alone, which would be satisfactory to both sides of that marriage.</p>

				<p>PS</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve two reasons for believing that the risk of future surrender would be minor:</p>
<p>1, Russia (like a number of states with a history of vigorous intelligence operations, including the U.S.) prides itself on taking good care of defectors: any failure in this regard would severely deter future defections.</p>
<p>2, After such a debacle, the U.S. would have no pragmatic interest in his repatriation: best to leave him <em>in situ</em> &#8212; so there would be no <em>actual</em> pressure, notwithstanding some &#8220;empty formal gesture&#8221; to the contrary.</p>

<p>re: <i>immunity and protection</i></p>
<p>Immunity from deportation/rendition/extradition is wobbly at best.  First you have it, then you don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Keeping a low profile may help but then, you may have &#8220;friends&#8221; that will setup a fun flight. You never know when you get on the plane if/when/where you will land.</p>
<p>Or, you might have a parent, with god&#8217;s own powers, to kidnap you off the streets of England, hire armed thugs to haul you to a private airport and throw you on a private jet to take you &#8220;home&#8221;, where you will never be seen again.</p>

<li>Paul Rusesabagina: Did the “Hotel Rwanda” Hero Become a Terrorist?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>
On the evening of August 27, 2020, Paul Rusesabagina landed at the international airport in Dubai on an Emirates flight from Chicago. He had planned to continue on to Burundi that same night to give a talk at the invitation of a Protestant pastor.<br />
&#8230;<br />
Constantin Niyomwungere, the pastor who first invited him to Burundi. Rusesabagina bathed before leaving for the Al Maktoum airport with the pastor, where the two friends boarded a private plane operated by GainJet, a charter airline frequently used by the Rwandan government. When the plane landed shortly before sunrise, Rusesabagina assumed he had arrived in Burundi.<br />
&#8230;<br />
But armed security forces confronted him on the tarmac, arresting him and dragging him into a car. It was then, at the latest, that Rusesabagina realized that he hadn&#8217;t landed in Burundi but in the Rwandan capital city of Kigali. He had fallen into a trap: His friend, the pastor, was working with the regime&#8230;.

At this stage, the Romans intervened and threatened Bithynia into giving up Hannibal.[77] Prusias agreed, but the general was determined not to fall into his enemy&#8217;s hands. The precise year and cause of Hannibal&#8217;s death are unknown. Pausanias wrote that Hannibal&#8217;s death occurred after his finger was wounded by his drawn sword while mounting his horse, resulting in a fever and then his death three days later.[78] Cornelius Nepos[79] and Livy,[80] however, tell a different story, namely that the ex-consul Titus Quinctius Flamininus, on discovering that Hannibal was in Bithynia, went there in an embassy to demand his surrender from King Prusias. Hannibal, discovering that the castle where he was living was surrounded by Roman soldiers and he could not escape, took poison. Appian writes that it was Prusias who poisoned Hannibal.[81]

				<p>@SpaceLifeForm @Clive @All,</p>
<p>Rewriting the CPU microcode can actually be useful from the<br />
security point of view.</p>
<p>I can make my CPU unique. I can write my own instruction set (ISA),<br />
write my own Linux compiler and change all my software accordingly.<br />
I can even change it daily. Today NOP is 90, tomorrow CC, day after<br />
that EB. Old x86/x64 shellcode don&#8217;t work any more.</p>
<p>To get a foothold on the system they should first guess the ISA. No<br />
universal high level language like Javascript.</p>

				<p>I recall a marathon meeting with Intel senior CPU architects in which we tried to explain why a tiny change in the architecture was needed to better support multiprogramming and virtual memory (many ears ago). Obviously smart people only &#8220;came around&#8221; begrudgingly after 6 hours on the white boards. That they have a cavalier attitude toward security is not surprising. I doubt they will even connect any market pressures stemming from these issues with their designs, clinging to speed tests as the only important metric.<br />
Does anyone remember physical &#8220;maintance mode&#8221; switches?</p>

If the fuse was not blown, I&#8217;m guessing you would have to write a boot loader fuzzer while the CPU was in 16bit real mode, cr0 &amp; 0x00 ,you can still print to screen and access ram,HDD ,would be a fun challenge but a head ache.</p>

<p>re: <i> Snowden family </i></p>
<p>I vaguely recall the following, probably out of date:</p>
<p>iirc(badly)  Snowden is married and they have a child born in RU. They have both applied to be dual citizens so they can avoid the unpleasantness seen in Western Countries where parents are separated from their children for a variety of &#8220;official reasons&#8221;, practices current in the USA, UK, Australia among others.</p>
<p>re: <i>Snowden income sources </i></p>
<p>iirc(badly) The USA has put a global garnishment on all incomes going to ESnowden.  This includes speaking honorarium (eg video conferences), book sales royalties and any donated or organization funding. The stamp is somewhere in the &#8220;anti terrorist funding laws&#8221;.  Anyone doing business in the USA can get into a heap of bother PDQ if found to be &#8220;funding anyone&#8221; under those laws.</p>
<p>re: <i>Snowden Status </i></p>
<p>While Snowden may be less interesting in the nano-second concentration level of doom-scrollers, he is certainly still a Person of Interest to the 3Ls and would be a plum target for rendition.  Of course, given the USA-RU drunkards boasts that might not happen unless the US hires someone from the ME to do it.  There&#8217;s loads of experience and success stories in that part of the world.</p>
<p>Over on EmptyWheel, she does some postings about the legal status of the Big Dudes currently on the We Wants It List.  Just a heads up, it&#8217;s not a friendly view of what&#8217;s in store if any of them are renditioned /extradited to the USA.</p>

<p>I doubt dual citizenship will protect from that.</p>
<p>I forgot about financial restrictions. Those make it even likelier that Russia is directly paying his family&#8217;s living expenses.</p>
<p>Ed&#8217;s wife is likely to be in legal trouble as is he and, if he stays there long enough for their child to become old enough, their child could be charged as well (depending on evidence). I agree he is still of major interest, just that the public&#8217;s interest is not as powerful as it once was.</p>
<p>One shouldn&#8217;t rule out a charging of Melania (depending on evidence) and there&#8217;s been talk of Donald&#8217;s children being at risk. If any of them have a role in an escape, that&#8217;s all the more risk.</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<blockquote><p>RF. Signal. Noise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Too little information given to say for certain, but&#8230; It&#8217;s almost certainly &#8220;Signal + Plan&#8221;.</p>
<p>To understand why you need to look at the broadcast spectrum of TV channels. Even modern digital ones have &#8220;holes in the spectrum&#8221; you can use.</p>
<p>The signal of choice to use oroginally is &#8220;Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum&#8221; (DSSS) due to &#8220;chipping/coding gain&#8221;.</p>
<p>In essence you create an artificial very broad band &#8220;noise signal&#8221; and &#8220;bi-phase&#8221; modulate it with your digital data[1]. The &#8220;coding gain is more or less the clock rate of the artificial noise signal divided by the data bit rate. Using modern codecs that are open source (see OGG) you can get very low data rates with inteligable audio so getting a coding gain of a thousand is not that difficult.</p>
<p>However what people forget is that the coding gain is reciprocal in nature. At the receiver the artificial noise signal would spread the TV signal by the same coding gain thus diminishing it and improving the wanted Signal to Noise ratio (Look up &#8220;Low Probability of Intercept&#8221; (LPI) systems).</p>
<p>The upshot is you can tuck a DSSS comms system under a TV channel and have it virtually undetectable by the majority of people watching TV broadcast in that channel. It&#8217;s a trick I used to use when sending &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; signals through satellite TV transponders back last century. You can still do this with little difficulty using US Navy geo-stationary satellites which is done by Brazilian and other South American criminals some of whom are very much into the drugs trade. Though they tend not to use DSSS systems for various reasons.</p>
<p>But using this spectrum this way in the TV broadcast bands is not of necesity &#8220;Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves&#8221; it&#8217;s actually approved and licenced in some parts of the world[2].</p>
<p>[1] You can do this at home with a few TTL gates. First ceate your noise signal with a Linear Feedback Shift Register&#8221;(LFSR) using clocked latches and a couple of XOR gates. Take this signal to one input of an XOR gate and apply your digital signal to the other gate. The output is a bi-phase modulated squarewave. You can clean it up and use it to drive a diode ring double balanced mixer with an RF carrier and that&#8217;s your DSSS transmitter&#8230;</p>
<p>[2] You might have heard of &#8220;TV White Space Broadcasting&#8221; which is the modern version of how to share Broadcast TV spectrum, much of which is empty. It&#8217;s been going on since the 1970&#8217;s one way or another. The original use of DSSS was to get around the problem of diferent parys of the spectrum being used or not in any given area. Back in the 1970&#8217;s and early 1980&#8217;s it was felt that using &#8220;guard channels&#8221; entirely would be to difficult. However with modern computer chips and Digital TV Broadcasting (DTB) the systems can just use the local &#8220;Matrix Channel&#8221; to find out what frequencies are and are not in use so using guard channels exclusively is now not a problem.</p>

				<p>@ Clive, Winter, Weather, Anders, ALL</p>
<p>After thinking about this more, I think I read the attack angle wrong, and my comment is totally incorrect.</p>
<p>With this instant microcode issue, it is very possible that an attacker can cause cache flushes.</p>
<p>And, therefore, timing attacks.</p>
<p>Even if the instruction fails.</p>
<p>We DO NOT KNOW the side effects of the DECODE AT MICROCODE LEVEL.</p>
<p>Even if the instruction will fail, but is DECODED at microcode level, even at non-privleged level, we do not know the side-effects at microcode level.</p>
<p>Not having RED-Level Unlock does not mean that there is is not a magic sequence of instructions that get you there.</p>
<p>But, even if the the instruction at non-priv userland fails, does not mean that a cache flush was not forced.</p>

				<p>@slf<br />
Use the instruction cache flush, search Google for &#8216;and x86 asmebly refence&#8217; it about the first hit, there are multiple of them, doing it remotely by packet not so much.<br />
It might be a system instruction, maybe inturupt request to windows and get it to run it, try fuzzing those insturuction its &#8216;int byte&#8217; with eax normal output and edx,ECX possibility EDI input.</p>
<p>PS if you can find the instruction I&#8217;ll post later on phone</p>

				<p>@SpaceLifeForm &#8211; yes the &#8220;improvement&#8221; in BIOS updating removed the need for the jumper.  I was actually think of way earlier when systems filled the room and the main computer had a small second computer for diagnostics.<br />
Some may recall the diagnose (diag) instruction used by engineers on the 360 but then, because it was an otherwise unused opcode, used to signal communication with the hypervisor (in old CP/CMS days).<br />
A program that tries all opcodes doesn&#8217;t find the undocumented function that are only triggered when some set of other conditions are present; register values, flags, and what is in the pipeline.<br />
I suppose a microcode update could turn of the undocumented features&#8230;</p>

				<p>@ CarpetCat,</p>
<blockquote><p>Doesn’t this get stripped out now a days with the digital conversion?</p></blockquote>
<p>It depends on what type of method the satellite uses for it&#8217;s function, which also depends on how old it is.</p>
<p>The simplest type of satellite and the one that was most reliable design for a very long period of time is the &#8220;linear transponder&#8221; that is &#8220;band inverting&#8221;.</p>
<p>That is you &#8220;block convert&#8221; the output of the receive filter to another frequency range without demodulating the signals, and push it through a Traveling Wave Tube (TWT) or similar high gain wide band amplifier and push that through filters before it goes to the TX antenna.</p>
<p>This sort of transponder satellite is the type you go for because other than turn the transponder off there is little the operator can do.</p>
<p>Also you need to know the birds orbit type that is if it&#8217;s geo stationary or orbiting and the relative velocities as that effects Doppler shift. Then there is the added wrinkle of if the transponder is band inverting or not as this not only effects Doppler shift it can effect some types of modulation. Because if it&#8217;s band inverting as you increase the frequency at the input the frequency decreases at the output. So Upper Side Band (USB) signals become Lower Side Band (LSB) signals.</p>
<p>As for limits yes there are many but like Cable Televison Cabinate Amplifiers provided you take care everyone gets a usefull slice of the cake.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember is it&#8217;s not the aggregate power of the individual signals that marks the first limit, but the sum of the peak voltages for each signal.</p>

				<p>If you pick linear transponders as your mode of transport, you should realize that lighting up multiple satellites allows finding your location via timing differences due to path length differences. Signals can be discovered by corrolating the output of two or more transponders.</p>

				<p>@ MK, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>you should realize that lighting up multiple satellites allows finding your location via timing differences due to path length differences.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can do the same with a single satellite if it moves with respect to your transmitter, by building up a succession of &#8220;running fix lines&#8221;. The more lines the more accurate the fix.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the principle used behind the COSPAS SARSAT (Search And Rescue SATellite) system agreed in the late 1970&#8217;s and up and working with it&#8217;s first rescue chalked up in the early 1980&#8217;s has helped rescue more than 50,000 people since from &#8220;Air, Land and Sea&#8221; accidents and incidents.</p>
<p>The network of satellites[1] pick up the so-called &#8220;406 beacons&#8221;[2] which after thirty years still function as intended. However improvments in technology and changing requirments for International Safty regulations has resulted in vastly more beacons required that due to accidental triggering and multiple personal beacons automatically activated in an incident has given rise to a second generation system with increased data capacity as well as GPS data [3].</p>
<p>It&#8217;s expected that this system will remain in use for atleast another century even with increasing deployment and usage.</p>
<p>[1] All four Global Satellite Navigation Systems, Chinese BeiDou (BDS),  European Galileo, Russian GLONAS, and US Global Positioning System (GPS) now carry transponders. There are upper Low Earth Orbit (LEO ~100min Polar) satellites as well as geostationary satellites and it is also possible to put transponder units on aircraft that fly at altitude. The aircraft option has been untill recently only a &#8220;technical excercise&#8221;, however concerns over the likes of Elon Musk&#8217;s StarLink system has given rise to it being &#8220;dusted off&#8221; and reappraised.</p>
<p>[2] The &#8220;406 beacons&#8221; get their name from the frequency they transmit on (406MHz) to distinguish them from the earlier civil and military maratime and aeronautic rescue beacons on 121.5Mhz and 243MHz that were DF&#8217;d by aircraft.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_position-indicating_radiobeacon_station" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_position-indicating_radiobeacon_station</a></p>
<p>[3] &#8220;Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon&#8221;(EPIRB) systems that put out just a few milliwats CW and have a battery life good for atleast several hours. The first generation beacons transmit ~90bits of ID and other information using binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) on one of many 3Khz wide channels in the 100KHz band assigned to the service by the ITU (under the UN Secretariat). Second generation systems will use Quad Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) on a Spread Spectrum (SS) carrier. This not only improves the sensitivity and resolution of the system it also alows many more beacons to operate at the same time in a localised area as it&#8217;s inherently a &#8220;Code Division Multiple Access&#8221;(CDMA) system. The amount of data will also be increased containing new sources of data. Due to the use of SS both generations will happily co-exist in the same spectrum.</p>

<p>As for AMSAT and Co, yes they&#8217;ve done a fair bit over the years, the trouble is that in certain parts &#8220;politics with a capital P&#8221; have taken over.

I'm a fellow and lecturer at Harvard's <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/bruce-schneier">Kennedy School</a>, a board member of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and the Chief of Security Architecture at <a href="https://inrupt.com/">Inrupt, Inc.</a> This personal website expresses the opinions of none of those organizations.</p>
