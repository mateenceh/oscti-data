				<p>Why personal change is not easy?</p>
<p>Many people say they want to change the way they act or feel but find they can&#8217;t. Neurobiologist Gerhard Roth offers an explanation. He says a range of factors play a role in determining whether and how and at what pace we change, including the brain.</p>

				<p>Can young blood slow aging?</p>
<p>Scientists at Stanford gave old mice plasma from the blood of young ones; certain proteins crossed the so-called blood-brain barrier and evidently enhanced their performance of everyday tasks. Is the process transferable to human neurodegenerative diseases?</p>

<p>Good 4 minutes video! I hope you can see vividly who can for sure benefit out of such treatment.</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<blockquote><p>This is hard to understand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not realy, it&#8217;s about time the IC and SigInt agencies had a good kick up the backside for their bovine scat &#8220;We are the good guys&#8221; nonsense.</p>
<p>They are commiting criminal acts, as they are fond of pointing out to other countries by issuing indictments. I said such politically inspired nonsense would &#8220;back fire&#8221; and now it has, they have been hoist by their own petard.</p>
<p>That as they say is &#8220;how the cookie crumbles&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google did the right thing, both legaly and morally the opposite of those they pulled the plug on.</p>
<p>This waily waily hair pulling and gnashing of teath is just doubling down on the stupidity.</p>
<p>The claim is as always &#8220;major terrorist&#8221; or &#8220;major drugs&#8221; or &#8220;major XXX&#8221; in one of the is it now 47 &#8220;Wars on XXX&#8221; the US is running to ensure it&#8217;s position.</p>
<p>Look at it another way US politicals for their own purposes outed a CIA operative which is a major crime, they outed a UK boots on the ground operative thus killing him off as an operational asset, they outed a European IC agency by revealing that they had hacked into the webcams on laptops in Russia killing that off as a method, and several more.</p>
<p>This &#8220;major XXX&#8221; is a knee jerk response more often than not closely followed by the &#8220;endangering of US lives&#8221; in a &#8220;think of the children&#8221; FUD campaign.</p>
<p>But whenever their claims have been contested and checked the facts appear not to be aligned with the rhetoric.</p>
<p>But flip it the other way, eleven zero days got fixed, we do not know as nobody has said yet if they realy were zero days. So as was alleged about Russia and China using the same exploits if correct suggests zero days get used by anyone who finds or sees them.</p>
<p>How much harm could be done by these eleven zero days, well we kind of know, when alegadly the Russian affiliates used a US IC zero day as fake ransomware&#8230;</p>
<p>So if we are going to have this sort of bull scat flung out by unamed US Gov representatives, perhaps people should issue counter balancing arguments about the harms the &#8220;We are the good guys&#8221; and &#8220;might is right&#8221; nonsense is causing.</p>
<p>As far as I&#8217;m concerned Google did the right thing ethically, morally, and legally.</p>
<p>So from that point of view not that hard to understand.</p>
<p>But is there a back story on this that is the implication being hung in the back ground. That is are Google &#8220;pushing back&#8221; against the USG for some reason? If it was Facebook I would not be surprised to see people raise it as a flag in the foreground.</p>
<p>History indicates that the NSA tapped many of Googles intersite back haul cables and that Google were upset about the illegal activity.</p>
<p>So I will reserve judgment on if this is &#8220;pay back&#8221; or not, but in a way Google has broken a dam the question is will others follow and reveal the truth of what US Agencies are upto, in the same way the US DoJ has done with it&#8217;s politically inspired indictments and much flapping of it&#8217;s gums.</p>
<p>We all know that with very high probability it was the US Agencies that started spying on other Nations via the Internet, the fact that sovereign nations have seen fit to retaliate in kind and the USG got all sniffy about it does not change the fact that if you throw stones at people they will throw some back as hard if not harder. There is that oft quoted line of &#8220;Do unto others as you woud have them do unto you&#8221;&#8230;</p>

				<p>Let&#8217;s see: to charge an 80 KWh battery in 5 minutes (1/12 hour) requires a charger that can deliver 960 Kw. That&#8217;s 1,600 amps at 600 volts. I don&#8217;t want to be anywhere near that vehicle while it is being charged.</p>

				<p>@ Clive</p>
<p>I left out the &#8216;allegedly&#8217;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really only hard to understand if one has not been paying attention for decades.</p>
<p>That said, I am very curious to discern what op was burned.</p>
<p>In particular, if it was a US op.  Which is my hunch.  That it was not a non-US FVEY.</p>

				<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter who is doing it or why they are doing it, in my book intentionally hoarding a known flaw in a piece of software so it can be abused for hacking rather than handing that flaw over to the developers of the software so it can be fixed is bad.</p>

<p>As @MK has noted being around a 1MW charging unit is not going to be fun, especially in high humidity or rain.</p>
<p>But also the usual hype gets in the way of a little reality. Back in the 1930&#8217;s there were electric vehicles running of large lead acid accumulators. Even back then they knew that the supply of lead was not just finite but quite restricted in availability especially as it was used for many other things including roofing and water pipes.</p>
<p>Move forward nearly a century later and it&#8217;s lithium we are looking at. That to is finite but also restricted in supply. Realistically we do not have enough to make anything close to the number of batteries required to switch over from gasoline to electric.</p>
<p>But also we&#8217;ve known how to charge a battery in 5-Minutes or less for decades. The process is little different to putting gasoline in a fuel tank.</p>
<p>Just two methods of several that can used are,</p>
<p>Firstly, adding ethonal to a fuel tank to be used by fuel cells.</p>
<p>Secondly, by swapping the electrolite liquid in a battery that does not undergo chemical change to the electrodes.</p>
<p>The second is intetesting because the electrodes do not undergo chemical / physical change thus will last many thousands of charge cycles unlike more mainstream batteries. Esentially the charge station consists of two tanks, the first contains the depleated electrolyte from bateries. This electrolyte passes through a charging cell and goes to a second tank and holds the recharged electrolyte to put back in batteries.</p>
<p>The downside is that the energy density is low and the electrolite chemicals are realy quite unpleasent not just to humans but the entire environment.</p>

				<p>I was looking at power tools this week, and it seems &#8220;IoT&#8221; has begun to infect this business. Some Milwaukee tools have a &#8220;wireless&#8221;-looking logo on them. The manual says it&#8217;s a &#8220;One-Key&#8221; feature that can be used to track tools, and to <i>remotely disable them</i> (&#8220;If your tool is lost or stolen, render it useless by sending a remote shut-down command to the tool for the next time it comes within range of any open ONE-KEY app&#8221;). Doesn&#8217;t say what, if any, input is needed on the tool to pair with it; nor did I find any mention of whether it&#8217;s possible to disable the feature (the manual says it relies on a CR2032 cell inside the tool; doesn&#8217;t say whether it&#8217;s the feature or the tool that stops working if that&#8217;s removed, but an anti-theft feature shouldn&#8217;t be so easy to bypass, which makes me think the latter).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen at least one other brand with a similar feature, and I find no public security research on any of them. That&#8217;s not a good sign, if the history of IoT is any indication (and given the text that says literally any phone can send the disable command—sure, it could be done securely in theory, but what are the chances?). Well, if any of y&#8217;all were looking for a project, here you go.</p>

<p>Thanks for the link to the FT article on hydrodynamics and the Suez accident.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting; the stuff about induced yaw was new to me; and hopefully this will contribute to figuring out how to avoid such accidents in the future.</p>

				<p>re: fast charge batteries</p>
<p>The video mentioned the key point: getting the effective series resistance down. But, waving my Red Flag again, there are buses tootling around cities in China on <b>supercapacitors</b>. Granted they are free from range anxiety: at selected stops a pantograph rises to meet overhead charging terminals. 20% charge in 2 minutes is all they need. Enough capacity to stop-start a bus should translate easily to a lighter vehicle.</p>

				<p>@ MarkH, Clive, ALL</p>
<p>Supposedly, there will be a crane barge large enough to remove containers from the Ever Given on site this weekend.  I expect it to arrive Starboard.</p>
<p>The problem:  Only one.  There needs to be one on each side to keep the ship balanced as I seriously doubt the crane will be able to reach across.</p>
<p>Everything needs to be done VERY CAREFULLY.</p>
<p>Your second thought is what I was thinking.  Very close.</p>
<p>I am surprised that I do not see any digging effort at stern.  It seems to me that digging the stern free (holding ship in place with tugs), will reduce tidal stress on the hull.  Because, at this time, the ship is basically a bridge. The west side has more sand than rock.  Note the rock on east side is not solid rock, but large chunks.  But you can not call it sand or even gravel.</p>
<p>If the hull is breached due to tidal stress, a huge problem and we are definitely into next year.</p>
<p>The other big problem is the digging on bow end.  It must be balanced also.  Sucking out the sand on bow port side is not going to free it.  There really is plenty of rock.</p>
<p>This operation is extremely simple to completely screw up.</p>
<p>Done wrong, and it becomes keel over.</p>
<p>These are the two big issues:  Hull breach, or, keel over.</p>
<p><b>This operation is extremely simple to completely screw up.</b></p>

<p>You would have to be such an idiot to think that the virus just by coincidence started in Wuhan and that it had nothing to do with the BSL-4 lab there that was doing experiments on these types of coronaviruses. Like&#8230; of all the places in the world that this virus could have started spreading&#8230; it just happened to be a few miles from this lab? Come on.<br />
And not only did people not believe this, they thought it was such an outrageous claim that any talk of it should be censored, and the subject should not even be open for debate. How dumb are these people? It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s no hope for them at all. If they&#8217;re so brainwashed that they don&#8217;t believe the lab in Wuhan had anything do to with the virus emerging there, there&#8217;s really nothing they wont believe. How could any rational person truly think the lab being there was just a coincidence? Yet apparently all these &#8220;scientists&#8221; and &#8220;experts&#8221; who are supposedly only interested in truth and facts pushed the theory of animal transmission without any real evidence to support that idea.</p>

<p>There is a reason I called this an &#8216;accident&#8217;.  Note quotes.</p>
<p>I do not believe there is any hope that the tide will be large enough.</p>
<p>I do not see a 4+ foot rise as enough to lift her free.  Which is happening right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tide-forecast.com/locations/Suez-Egypt/tides/latest" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.tide-forecast.com/locations/Suez-Egypt/tides/latest</a></p>
<p>Next shot, a bit better, in over 12 hours.</p>
<p>hxtps://www.thedailybeast.com/releasing-container-ship-from-suez-canal-could-capsize-it</p>
<p>They say heavy winds knocked the ship into the sandbanks, but data so far shows it was also traveling 13 knots in an 8-knot speed zone when the accident happened, according to Konrad.</p>
<p>Several salvors have also said the most likely cause was a blackout power outage that compromised steering just as the wind gust came up. Coincidentally, this same ship was involved in an accident in Hamburg in 2019, when its owners rammed into a ferry and destroyed it. They had blamed the accident on a loss of steering power and high winds back then, too.</p>
<p>Salvors say the next opportunity to move the ship will be during spring tides on Sunday and Monday. If that doesn’t work, it could take weeks to dig her out of the sand, all the while trying to keep her upright and intact.</p>

				<p>@SpaceLifeForm:</p>
<p>Your posts are wonderfully persistent!</p>
<p><em>There is no natural rock at the grounding site.</em>  The geology of the canal in that region is clay.</p>
<p>The stones you see in the photos are a facing &#8212; probably not more than a meter<br />
thick &#8212; call rip-rap by civil engineers.</p>
<p>This can be seen quite clearly, in some of the press photos of the work to refloat the monster.  Where the excavators have dug, a few scattered pieces of rip-rap can be seen.  Everything else is soft soil.</p>
<p>The Canal Authority puts rip-rap on the embankments, to protect the SOFT SOFT CLAY into which the southern canal is dug, from erosion caused by transit-induced waves.  Rip-rap is not structural, so it doesn&#8217;t need thickness or coherence.  It&#8217;s just a surface treatment to reduce erosion.</p>
<p>As I informed comment readers just a few days ago, less than 0.05 percent of the canal&#8217;s length had rock in the path of excavation.</p>
<p>As to barge cranes, some of the photos I&#8217;ve seen look titanic.  I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if some of them are capable of reaching across the width of the ship.  The big ones are designed for extremely massive loads; for them, the weight of a shipping container should be as nothing, even at full horizontal extension.</p>
<p>If you are the captain of a huge ship, you are educated in what can cause capsizing, and how to prevent it.  If you are the captain of a huge ship, capsizing is something you never, never, never want to happen, and you are extremely careful to prevent it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in nobody&#8217;s interest for Ever Given to capsize.  The captain of Ever Given, and the salvage experts in attendance, will be exceedingly careful to prevent such a calamity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tragic that IT geeks don&#8217;t run everything &#8230; we&#8217;re <em>so</em> much smarter at every other subject, than the professionals who&#8217;ve devoted their entire careers to them.  When will the world wake up to what it&#8217;s missing?</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<blockquote><p>That said, I am very curious to discern what op was burned.</p></blockquote>
<p>We may never get to know the reality of the situation, because the IC agencies do not like being embarrassed in any way for various political reasons.</p>
<p>If as indicated eleven zero days were being used, then that is quite profligate usage indicating one of three things,</p>
<p>1, They have zero days to burn.<br />
2, They think the zero days have no shelf life.<br />
3, The target was sophisticated in it&#8217;s defence.</p>
<p>Whilst they agency might have zero days to burn, the reporting was that the zero days were all related to one code base. Thus they might have been a &#8220;find one find them all&#8221; single root cause that slipped through automated test of the code. I guess we will get to know more on that in the near future. It might also be that some other AV/malware organisation had already reported one or more of the zero days so the count down clock was already ticking.</p>
<p>But lets consider the implication of a sophisticated target. That is one that takes a serious approach to defending their ICT assets, thus might need that number of zero days to get past their defences.</p>
<p>The fact that they are overly cautious in defence when compared to others does not in any way make them a threat short term or long term. That is they may be a company doing research into security or other communications etc and a SigInt agency want&#8217;s in on things early for various reasons. Before others claim &#8220;Good guys don&#8217;t do that&#8221; or similar mantra, we know that is far from being true, the Five-Eyes do it routienly and they&#8217;ve be caught at it in the past.</p>
<p>The one that comes immediately to mind is the attacks against cryptographers and similar that occured through BelgaCom[1]. What we would actually call &#8220;industrial espionage&#8221; plain and simple, and something I know from experience GCHQ has no qualms what so ever about doing. As well as handing over the information gained to &#8220;favoured manufacturers&#8221; to build equipment for them[2].</p>
<p>Then there are &#8220;alied governments&#8221; there is a long history of the NSA using the likes of the Olympics to get inside of the security perimiters of host nation telecoms agencies to spy on their leaders phone calls. We have good reason to believe that the US sees the EU as a significant threat to it&#8217;s economic position and has for decades been spying on the EU and it&#8217;s leaders in various ways, including back-doored crypto kit via a certain company in Zug Switzerland, and using attacks against EU leaders mobile phones[3].</p>
<p>But ask yourself a more important question,</p>
<p>&#8220;<b>What evidence is there that &#8220;terrorists&#8221; might have the level of sophistication to need eleven zero days?</b>&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer is of course &#8220;none that we are aware of&#8221;. Because we know that they do not trust networked electronic communications, ever since a missile landed on a person using a satellite phone. Which got further reinforced by drone strikes. That is they learned quickly and appart from doing reverse attacks to cause drone strikes on civilians thus bad publicity for US and other troops they tend to do their high level security some what differently. That is using trade craft methods of physical communications that smugglers have used for centuries that are well tried and known to work and are very resource intensive to get into and any intercepts become obvious.</p>
<p>Hopefully that will give you an indicator on what operations have been effected, and they are not the ones the article quotes would lead most to believe.</p>

<p>[2] Duncan Campbell knows about it as &#8220;UK Security Services&#8221; stole his designs for detecting telephone taps like the &#8220;infinity decice&#8221; where an RF carrier of near MW frequencies was used to jump the small capacitance of the &#8220;hook switch&#8221; in the phone. The Security Services then got Marconi to make similar units for the Security Services and other Political, Diplomatic and Military services to use.</p>

I've been writing about security issues on my <a href="/">blog</a> since 2004, and in my monthly <a href="/crypto-gram/">newsletter</a> since 1998. I'm a fellow and lecturer at Harvard's <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/bruce-schneier">Kennedy School</a>, a board member of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and the Chief of Security Architecture at <a href="https://inrupt.com/">Inrupt, Inc.</a> This personal website expresses the opinions of none of those organizations.</p>
