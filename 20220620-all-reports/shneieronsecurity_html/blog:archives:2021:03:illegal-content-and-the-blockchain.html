		<h2 class="entry">Illegal Content and the Blockchain</h2>
		<p>Security researchers have recently discovered a botnet with a novel defense against takedowns. Normally, authorities can disable a botnet by taking over its command-and-control server. With nowhere to go for instructions, the botnet is rendered useless. But over the years, botnet designers have come up with ways to make this counterattack harder. Now the content-delivery network Akamai has <a href="https://blogs.akamai.com/sitr/2021/02/bitcoins-blockchains-and-botnets.html">reported</a> on a new method: a botnet that uses the Bitcoin blockchain ledger. Since the blockchain is globally accessible and hard to take down, the botnet&#8217;s operators appear to be safe.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s best to avoid explaining the mathematics of Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain, but to understand the colossal implications here, you need to understand one concept. Blockchains are a type of &#8220;distributed ledger&#8221;: a record of all transactions since the beginning, and everyone using the blockchain needs to have access to &#8212; and reference &#8212; a copy of it. What if someone puts illegal material in the blockchain? Either everyone has a copy of it, or the blockchain&#8217;s security fails.</p>
<p>To be fair, not absolutely everyone who uses a blockchain holds a copy of the entire ledger. Many who buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum don&#8217;t bother using the ledger to verify their purchase. Many don&#8217;t actually hold the currency outright, and instead trust an exchange to do the transactions and hold the coins. But people need to continually verify the blockchain&#8217;s history on the ledger for the system to be secure. If they stopped, then it would be trivial to forge coins. That&#8217;s how the system works.</p>
<p>Some years ago, people <a href="http://www.righto.com/2014/02/ascii-bernanke-wikileaks-photographs.html">started noticing</a> all sorts of things embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain. There are digital images, including one of Nelson Mandela. There&#8217;s the Bitcoin logo, and the original paper describing Bitcoin by its alleged founder, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. There are advertisements, and several prayers. There&#8217;s even <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-33/accenture-editing-uneditable-blockchain.pdf">illegal pornography and leaked classified documents</a>. All of these were put in by anonymous Bitcoin users. But none of this, so far, appears to seriously threaten those in power in governments and corporations. Once someone adds something to the Bitcoin ledger, it becomes sacrosanct. Removing something requires a fork of the blockchain, in which Bitcoin fragments into multiple parallel cryptocurrencies (and associated blockchains). Forks happen, rarely, but never yet because of legal coercion. And repeated forking would destroy Bitcoin&#8217;s stature as a stable(ish) currency.</p>
<p>The botnet&#8217;s designers are using this idea to create an unblockable means of coordination, but the implications are much greater. Imagine someone using this idea to evade government censorship. <a href="https://cbeci.org/mining_map">Most</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2021/12/29/the-chinese-mining-centralization-of-bitcoin-and-ethereum/?sh=19f1b5142f66">Bitcoin</a> mining happens in <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-mining-in-xinjiang-china-could-be-a-red-flag-for-regulators-51613764881">China</a>. What if someone added a bunch of Chinese-censored <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/09/05/what-is-falun-gong">Falun Gong</a> texts to the blockchain?&lt;</p>
<p>What if someone added a type of political speech that Singapore routinely censors? Or cartoons that Disney holds the copyright to?</p>
<p>In Bitcoin&#8217;s and most other public blockchains there are no central, trusted authorities. Anyone in the world can perform transactions or become a miner. Everyone is equal to the extent that they have the hardware and electricity to perform cryptographic computations.</p>
<p>This openness is also a vulnerability, one that opens the door to asymmetric threats and small-time malicious actors. Anyone can put information in the one and only Bitcoin blockchain. Again, that&#8217;s how the system works.</p>
<p>Over the last three decades, the world has witnessed the power of open networks: <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3356098">blockchains</a>, social media, the very web itself. What makes them so powerful is that their value is related not just to the number of users, but <em>the number of potential links between users</em>. This is Metcalfe&#8217;s law &#8212; value in a network is quadratic, not linear, in the number of users &#8212; and every open network since has followed its prophecy.</p>
<p>As Bitcoin has grown, its monetary value has skyrocketed, even if its <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/theres-no-good-reason-to-trust-blockchain-technology">uses remain unclear</a>. With no barrier to entry, the blockchain space has been a Wild West of innovation and lawlessness. But today, many prominent advocates suggest Bitcoin should become a global, universal currency. In this context, asymmetric threats like embedded illegal data become a major challenge.</p>
<p>The philosophy behind Bitcoin traces to the earliest days of the open internet. Articulated in John Perry Barlow&#8217;s 1996 <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</a>, it was and is the ethos of tech startups: Code is more trustworthy than institutions. Information is meant to be free, and nobody has the right &#8212; and should not have the ability &#8212; to control it.</p>
<p>But information must reside somewhere. Code is written by and for people, stored on computers located within countries, and embedded within the institutions and societies we have created. To trust information is to <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/the-pandemic-heroes-who-gave-us-the">trust its chain of custody</a> and the <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/lessons-from-a-pandemic-anniversary">social context</a> it <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/critical-thinking-isnt-just-a-process">comes from</a>. Neither code nor information is value-neutral, nor ever free of human context.</p>
<p>Today, Barlow&#8217;s vision is a mere shadow; every society controls the information its people can access. Some of this control is through overt censorship, as China controls information about Taiwan, Tiananmen Square, and the Uyghurs. Some of this is through civil laws designed by the powerful for their benefit, as with Disney and US copyright law, or UK libel law.</p>
<p>Bitcoin and blockchains like it are on a collision course with these laws. What happens when the interests of the powerful, with the law on their side, are pitted against an open blockchain? Let&#8217;s imagine how our various scenarios might play out.</p>
<p>China first: In response to Falun Gong texts in the blockchain, the People&#8217;s Republic decrees that any miners processing blocks with banned content will be taken offline &#8212; their IPs will be blacklisted. This causes a hard fork of the blockchain at the point just before the banned content. China might do this under the guise of a &#8220;patriotic&#8221; messaging campaign, publicly stating that it&#8217;s merely maintaining financial sovereignty from Western banks. Then it uses paid influencers and moderators on social media to pump the China Bitcoin fork, through both partisan comments and transactions. Two distinct forks would soon emerge, one behind China&#8217;s Great Firewall and one outside. Other countries with similar governmental and media ecosystems &#8212; Russia, Singapore, Myanmar &#8212; might consider following suit, creating multiple national Bitcoin forks. These would operate independently, under mandates to censor unacceptable transactions from then on.</p>
<p>Disney&#8217;s approach would play out differently. Imagine the company announces it will sue any ISP that hosts copyrighted content, starting with networks hosting the biggest miners. (Disney has sued to enforce its intellectual property rights in China before.) After some legal pressure, the networks cut the miners off. The miners reestablish themselves on another network, but Disney keeps the pressure on. Eventually miners get pushed further and further off of mainstream network providers, and resort to tunneling their traffic through an anonymity service like Tor. That causes a major slowdown in the already slow (because of the mathematics) Bitcoin network. Disney might issue takedown requests for Tor exit nodes, causing the network to slow to a crawl. It could persist like this for a long time without a fork. Or the slowdown could cause people to jump ship, either by forking Bitcoin or switching to another cryptocurrency without the copyrighted content.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s illegal pornographic content and leaked classified data. These have <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-33/accenture-editing-uneditable-blockchain.pdf">been on</a> the Bitcoin blockchain for over five years, and nothing has been done about it. Just like the botnet example, it may be that these do not threaten existing power structures enough to warrant takedowns. This could easily change if Bitcoin becomes a popular way to share child sexual abuse material. Simply having these illegal images on your hard drive is a felony, which could have significant repercussions for anyone involved in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Whichever scenario plays out, this may be the Achilles heel of Bitcoin as a global currency.</p>
<p>If an open network such as a blockchain were threatened by a powerful organization &#8212; China&#8217;s censors, Disney&#8217;s lawyers, or the FBI trying to take down a more dangerous botnet &#8212; it could fragment into multiple networks. That&#8217;s not just a nuisance, but an existential risk to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Suppose Bitcoin were fragmented into 10 smaller blockchains, perhaps by geography: one in China, another in the US, and so on. These fragments might retain their original users, and by ordinary logic, nothing would have changed. But Metcalfe&#8217;s law implies that the overall value of these blockchain fragments <em>combined</em> would be a mere tenth of the original. That is because the value of an open network relates to how many others you can communicate with &#8212; and, in a blockchain, transact with. Since the security of bitcoin currency is achieved through expensive computations, fragmented blockchains are also easier to attack in a conventional manner &#8212; through a 51 percent attack &#8212; by an organized attacker. This is especially the case if the smaller blockchains all use the same hash function, as they would here.</p>
<p>Traditional currencies are generally not vulnerable to these sorts of asymmetric threats. There are no viable small-scale attacks against the US dollar, or almost any other fiat currency. The institutions and beliefs that <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/423/the-invention-of-money">give money its value</a> are deep-seated, despite instances of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation#Notable_hyperinflationary_periods">currency hyperinflation</a>.</p>
<p>The only notable attacks against fiat currencies are in the form of counterfeiting. Even in the past, when counterfeit bills were common, attacks <a href="https://time.com/3774327/lincoln-history-secret-service">could be thwarted</a>. Counterfeiters require specialized equipment and are vulnerable to law enforcement discovery and arrest. Furthermore, most money today &#8212; even if it&#8217;s nominally in a fiat currency &#8212; doesn&#8217;t exist in paper form.</p>
<p>Bitcoin attracted a following for its openness and immunity from government control. Its goal is to create a world that replaces cultural power with cryptographic power: verification in code, not trust in people. But there is no such world. And today, that feature is a vulnerability. We really don&#8217;t know what will happen when the human systems of trust come into conflict with the trustless verification that make blockchain currencies unique. Just last week we saw <a href="https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1365844883756314627">this exact attack</a> on smaller blockchains &#8212; not Bitcoin yet. We are watching a public socio-technical experiment in the making, and we will witness its success or failure in the not-too-distant future.</p>

				<p>There are two avenues for states to thwart the introduction of illegal content on the ledger:</p>
<p>1: Bitcoin owners are not really anonymous, just pseudonymous, as many criminals have discovered. And work is underway to separate really anonymous bitcoin users from those who have supplied Know-Your-Customer data. The upshot is, that any bitcoin not declared with KYC info will not be usable with any Western (or Chinese) customer. There are already blacklists of bitcoins.</p>
<p>2: The bitcoin miners are much more centralized than the users. States could go after the miners who validated the contaminated blocks. If miners and mining pools get hefty fines (or worse) when they validate transactions with illegal content, this would quickly stop.</p>

				<p>I found this fascinating. The blockchain is accumulating non-functional and even detrimental elements organisms&#8217; genomes do &#8211; fossil viruses if you like. And if you want to stretch the analogy further, forking = speciation events.</p>

				<p>The inclusion of illegal pornography or potentially classified information seems like it might be a malicious attack to discredit and destroy the blockchain.</p>
<p>We do know many governments (OECD and non-OECD) are none too thrilled with the existence of currency outside of their control.</p>

				<p>Sounds like the bug here is supporting metadata in the ledger. Just support, you know, ledger data. I think people would complain but then get along just fine. Third party metadata services might pop up, allowing this &#8220;content&#8221; to be removed without forking.</p>

				<p>I do not really understand the problem. As I tried to find the amount of data that can be stored on the Bitcoin ledger, the maximum I could find was 83 byte per transaction:<br />
<a href="https://fc17.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/bitcoin17-final32.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">https://fc17.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/bitcoin17-final32.pdf</a></p>
<p>As Bitcoin transactions are not free of charge nowadays, it becomes rather expensive to store lots of data there.</p>
<p>So, the question becomes, how much data can actually be stored in a Bitcoin transaction? 83 bytes or more?</p>

				<p>Illegal content aside, does the blockchain have any defense against a flooding attack? Could someone dump enough random crap in there to render the blockchain useless for its intended purpose?  It seems like any sort of ledger which must be world-writable and does not tolerate deletion would be wide open to this sort of attack.</p>

				<p>@Seth: the trouble is that &#8216;ledger data&#8217; is just, well, bits.  And bits are famously capable of encoding anything.  I could encode a series of transactions for 65, 32, 83, 69, 67, 82, 69 &amp; 84 units of whatever currency I&#8217;m interested in.  That&#8217;s a perfectly fine sequence of transactions &#8230; but it&#8217;s also something else.</p>

				<p>I found the way the data is stored in the ledger, it abuses the bitcoin addresses.</p>
<p>The bits are cut up in bitcoin address size chunks and these are then entered as the outgoing addresses for a transaction. The limit is 100,000 bytes per transaction, which is considerable. A miner can use a complete block of 1 MB.</p>
<p>You collect all the (fake) addresses and can reconstruct the original file from the bits.</p>
<p>As the addresses are fake, the ingoing bitcoins become unspendable.</p>

				<p>Techniques that ban &#8220;contaminated&#8221; blocks won&#8217;t work because data can be split up, so the &#8220;illegality&#8221; of each piece can&#8217;t be determined separately, and distributed arbitrarily deeply in the chain.</p>
<p>Second, the network always has the option of reaching consensus to remove arbitrary data by forking to make a new chain whose initial state is all the non-objectionable data and transactions. So the problem reduces to &#8220;what if the gov&#8217;t tries to make bitcoin illegal for reasons that the network doesn&#8217;t agree with&#8221;, which is not a new problem.</p>

				<p>This is nothing new. There is a log of shit stored just in the Bitcoin blockchain &#8211; probably some is stored in the others, too.</p>
<p>Here are some amusing examples of what&#8217;s there, including Wikileaks leaked cables:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.righto.com/2014/02/ascii-bernanke-wikileaks-photographs.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.righto.com/2014/02/ascii-bernanke-wikileaks-photographs.html</a></p>
<p>And then, there is the not-so-amusing stuff&#8230;</p>
<p>Child pornography is stored there &#8211; yes, both links and images.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Researchers from the RWTH Aachen University, Germany found that around 1,600 files were currently stored in bitcoin’s blockchain. Of the files least eight were of sexual content, including one thought to be an image of child abuse and two that contain 274 links to child abuse content, 142 of which link to dark web services.
</p></blockquote>

<p>There are viruses stored in it, also the EICAR Test String (which isn&#8217;t malicious but it&#8217;s a standard string that scanners detect as malware to demonstrate safely how they react when detecting malware).</p>
<p>The use of blockchain for command-and-control purposes of malware has been considered for quite some time, here&#8217;s an article from a year ago:</p>

				<blockquote><p>
Suppose Bitcoin were fragmented into 10 smaller blockchains, perhaps by geography: one in China, another in the US, and so on. [..] Metcalfe’s law implies that the overall value of these blockchain fragments combined would be a mere tenth of the original.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s worse than that.<br />
One major use of bitcoin is to move money across national boundaries outside of government purview, e.g. CNY -&gt; bitcoin -&gt; CAD. National silos prevent that.</p>

				<p>@ Arclight,</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a persistent aspect that is different</p></blockquote>
<p>Not realy, history shows that graffiti was sometimes done with a chisel. At over a millennium or four[1] that&#8217;s most definitely more permanent than the block chain 😉</p>
<p>Which realy emphasizes your first point, that people will put their message out any which way they can.</p>
<p>[1] Oh and do not forget &#8220;cave art&#8221; grinding red/orange ochre &#8211;haematite, iron(III) oxide, Fe2 O3 being the main pigment&#8211; into water that was then spat around a spread hand on a cave wall atlrast fifty millennia or more ago,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jan/13/worlds-oldest-known-cave-painting-found-in-indonesia" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jan/13/worlds-oldest-known-cave-painting-found-in-indonesia</a></p>
<p>And could be sixty or more millennium ago (Man arived in Australia ~65,000 years ago and would have first migrated slowly through Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the legandary Torres Strait[2] and into North Australia.</p>
<p>[2] The Torres Strait at just under a hundred miles wide at it&#8217;s narrowest, is legandary as being a hazardous place not just to shipping but as a place of islands and reefs fighting against nature and more recently climate change effects and now COVID. It&#8217;s also one of the few places in the world where an international trade route has &#8220;required pilotage&#8221;. The straits being relatively shallow and having a very large volume of water flow through it needs carefull timing not just daily but monthly and seasonally. Where exotically named lunar phases, such as super blue blood moon&#8217;s[3] create surging King tides that can surge upto 20ft above normal and annually inundate many of the Torres islands. At the best of times there are realy only three ways through the straits for ships that are designed for ocean going and only one of those for moderate to large size shipping transiting the region. The ferocity of the straits was known to Jules Vern who put it in his most famous book as a place where the all powerfull submarine of Capt Nemo floundered. For all it&#8217;s well deserved legendary ferocity it is actually one of the worlds major shipping routes.</p>
<p>[3] Super blue blood moon&#8217;s are actually very rare and may never happen in many peoples lives. It&#8217;s a combination of three events a &#8220;Super moon&#8221; where the moon is closest to the earth, a &#8220;Blood moon&#8221; that is when we have a total lunar eclipse and the moon is lit only by light reflected from the earth thus makes the moon look red or orange in colour, and the oddly named &#8220;Blue moon&#8221;. A &#8220;Blue moon&#8221; is an additional full moon in a season of the normal calander. It happens aproximately every 2.7 years or seven every 19years. It&#8217;s the third full moon in a season that has four new moons. It is possible for January and March to each have two full moons and Feburary none, but only the first in March would be the blue moon. It&#8217;s of mainly historical interest these days but less than a life time ago it was important to farmers due to growing cycles and days with longer light. It is however still of interest to those whos activities involve tidal waters and the migratory habits of some creatures like eels that are currently a subject of scientific research, that has been interupted by COVID.</p>

				<p>@ Bruce,</p>
<blockquote><p>— value in a network is quadratic, not linear, in the number of users — and every open network since has followed its prophecy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Err no, what we call &#8220;Metcalfe&#8217;s Law&#8221; applies to the number of the maximum potential &#8220;links&#8221; in a network of n nodes, not value derived from the network. It&#8217;s Based on the simple &#8220;m = 0.5(n^2 &#8211; n)&#8221; or the &#8220;nth triangular number&#8221;.</p>
<p>Even Metcalfe himself, has indicated this use for &#8220;value&#8221; is wrong and has proposed modified models. The one most hold with is Bob Briscoe&#8217;s Law, where the value of the network grows as &#8220;n log n&#8221; rather than &#8220;n^2&#8243;[1].</p>
<p>The reason for the popularity of the nth triangular number of n(n-1)/2 that Metcalfe had in his original 35mm slide, is it is asymptotically proportional to n^2. Thus to the &#8220;flim-flam investmant man&#8221; of the Internet Bubble etc, a growth on n^2 looks way better than n log n. If you mistakenly believe this &#8220;projected growth&#8221; and invest, then the chances are good that you will wind up as the old saying has it &#8220;A poorer, but wiser man&#8221;. For popcorn munchers and other observers without skin in the game we are about to see another Internet related implosion. That is we&#8217;ve already crossed the point where it costs more for new entrants to collect and collate PII than they can make from it&#8230; Which as it&#8217;s the financial model underlying the bottom feeders in the IoT business, is going to make a lot of peoples no-name devices stop working as the remote servers get turned off.</p>
<p>As you would expect early adopters of a technology see most value in it and usually get the best value from it (what looks initially like a variation of Zipf&#8217;s Law). However this value decreases with each later joiner untill you get to the point which is now happening with the Internet&#8230; Where new users see negative value in it and have to be coerced by legislation, regulation, or other force majeure / monopolistic practice. Usually involving Government entities such as Revenue and or Financial organisations who see the value in cuting their own internal costs by inflicting them on their users as a &#8220;externalized cost&#8221; hence the negative value view (I created a &#8220;growth&#8221; formular for this back in the mid 90&#8217;s, I had put it in a thesis I was writing, on &#8220;micro and pico charging on the Internet&#8221;, and the &#8220;Reader&#8221; objected to it, however history is tending to my view point).</p>
<p>Oh it looks like COVID is about to force &#8220;negative value&#8221; onto people via mobile phone usage. Many do not see value in mobile phones, even more see no value in smart devices. Governments want &#8220;Digital Vaccination Certificates&#8221;, in theory there is space in &#8220;Digital Passports&#8221; but many Governments are insisting Smart Phones are the way to go&#8230; Something tells me they realy have not thought it out yet, the same as they did not with digital passports.</p>
<p>[1] You might have met Bob Briscoe, and you can read an over view write up of his argument that was done for the IEEE,</p>

<p>The graffiti example isn&#8217;t quite right.  It&#8217;s more like a situation where, in order to remove some graffiti, you had to demolish the entire city on the foundations of which it was written.</p>

				<p>Bitcoin, blockchain, et al, have now become mainstream.  Mainstream means money.  Which means manipulation.  Big money only flows when stability is achieved.  And stability translates into control.</p>
<p>Now we see the big money taking control, manipulating and rigging profits.  Everything you see from this point forward is just the illusion of individual actors and independent groups that are actually all working in tandem, following a script, taking orders and using their positions as either media or as respectable sages to move the price lower and higher.</p>
<p>Shame on Bruce.  I don&#8217;t come here to listen to a parrot.</p>
<p>Watch now as more and more massive banks and hedge funds buy evermore crypto products, and watch how their controlled order taking minions disparage and cast doubt, lowering the price so their greedy masters can buy in.  Talk of bubbles, price swings, etc.  It&#8217;s all the same playbook from the beginning of time.</p>
<p>When you look around the room/world and try to educate yourself, try to compare and contrast, try to gather information, who would ever think that every source of knowledge has been carefully prepared and presented ahead of time?  It reminds me of the Sherlock movies with Moriarty.  When the lady believes she is safe in public, with a waiter she knows- Yet with a tap of the glass all the people stand and leave her alone.</p>
<p>More fear, more uncertainty, more doubt.  Let the heavies take care of it all!  Selling piece of mind with nominal fees!</p>
<p>Who tells you what to write/say/do, Bruce?  Shatter the illusion, damn the consequences.  Surely you have enough money by now.  Let the chips fall where they may.  This stagnant world we all live in now is corrupt to the very core.  Anarcho Capitalism I think it&#8217;s been called.  I don&#8217;t mean to insult you personally.  But you are in a position of power, you have the means.  I&#8217;m looking for leadership and in my blind desperation I lash out.</p>
<p>Prediction:  Bitcoin is going to the moon, this is just the big players getting in cheaper then normal.  In a few years, no one will care what&#8217;s in the blockchain or not.  Just wait and see.</p>

				<p>It sounds as though some folk are getting far too paranoid about the sheer availability of short snippets of absolutely arbitrary canned data and about how strongly large and powerful organizations of people (Governments, Disneys) are liable to react to said data.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s review your &#8220;Disney v Bitcoin&#8221; Movie Plot scenario first. How large would a file need to be in order for Disney to feel the need to wipe the data completely out of the blockchain? Are we talking about an asciiart image of Mickey Mouse&#8217;s face, or a 1080p copy of Avengers Endgame, here?</p>
<p>Because the latter is both far to large to ever get successfully encoded into the blockchain (at least not without incurring txn fees on at least a par with the actual production cost of the film), and already equally surreptitiously coded into FAR far less secure networks such as Usenet and Bittorrent without nearly as much fuss as you&#8217;re predicting.</p>
<p>I can download any one of a pantheon of freeware programs that will read an NZB index (that functions a lot like a fat URL) and use the data stored within that to download all of the many thousands of Usenet messages pointed to by that link, and then reconstruct the data hidden into those messages into the full 1-100 gigabyte file.. sometimes even at speeds sufficiently cozy to just sit and stream the damn thing on demand.</p>
<p>And Usenet is hardly a system replicated across hundreds of thousands of verifying bitcoin nodes across every continent. It&#8217;s literally just a mass of indexed messages that perhaps a hundred WELL known commercial providers simply agree to mirror between one another. But Disney can&#8217;t even succeed at keeping data out of <em>that</em> string and bailing wire mess!</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining is presently a bit more heavily centralized in China than many people are completely comfortable with, so it is at least plausible that China could wind up forcing a fork by throwing their weight around and threatening miners they have jurisdiction over. But another thing bitcoin mining is is potentially far more anonymous than anything Usenet has ever had.</p>
<p>Pulling the txn pool to build blocks and then publishing said blocks within reasonable time frames can quite easily be done via tor and even stacked with other proxies and time relay tricks if so desired. Hiding a ton of computing power may be a bit tougher, but less so when it&#8217;s crowdsourced via pooled mining.. which is a service that is not only easily hosted via anonymous networks like Tor/freenet/I2P, but would be easy to run as one identity while publishing blocks through a different, largely uncorrelated identity or set of throwaway handles. Then people who notice that you&#8217;ve pushed toxic block A wouldn&#8217;t even be able to easily tell that a specific anonymous mining pool is where that block came from!</p>
<p>And since the content of the blocks you&#8217;re crowdsourcing the signatures for doesn&#8217;t need to be held by the parties doing the pooled signing, said signers lose the opportunity to veto working on a block based upon what data they may or may not be able to detect within its transactions.</p>
<p>But ultimately all canned data remains meaningless without both an outer message and a relevant context. Here, the outer message is the indexing (like an NZB file) telling a soul where in the mess of a blockchain to find the data, and how to decode it. The context includes &#8220;why said data is important&#8221;. Both of those ingredients to the importance of any data will prove far easier for powerful forces to nullify for any given instance of canned data than trying to challenge the ledger on it&#8217;s own turf would be.</p>
<p>For example, relating to anti-civil canned data it&#8217;s easier to erase the indexing and decoding knowledge than to worry about the payload. How do end-users even know where/how to get the data? Somebody has bitcoin-NZB&#8217;s hosted on a site? Go shut down that site.</p>
<p>An example of attacking the context would be: say somebody publishes my bank details.. so, I have the bank change my account numbers or card numbers and then carry on with my day. Now the old data is no longer useful to anyone because I&#8217;ve shifted the context out from underneath of it.</p>
<p>Botnets are an interesting confluence where both of those avenues might also be difficult to attack.. but that is not a property that it shares in common with copyrighted garbage or with Falun Gong chick tracts.</p>
<p>So no, I am not sold on this among a hundred other more valid potential concerns being The End Of Bitcoin™. This ledger already encodes <em>monetary value</em> directly as data, and people are buying and selling the results of shifting said data around the ledger to the tune of many millions of dollars per day. I think one is honestly quite hard-pressed to find a motivation stronger than control over cold, hard cash to assail these particular globally distributed digital walls.</p>

				<blockquote><p>
  the original paper describing Bitcoin by its alleged founder, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. There are advertisements, and several prayers. There’s even illegal pornography and leaked classified documents. All of these were put in by anonymous Bitcoin users. But none of this, so far, appears to seriously threaten those in power in governments and corporations.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto allegedly still owns a rather large fraction of all Bitcoins in existence, circa 1.1 million according to the dsitributed ledger. Supposedly only 21,000,000 Bitcoins can ever exist, with 18,657,737.5 of them already mined, each Bitcoin allegedly worth $57,909.50 USD.</p>
<p>Which is a total of just over $1,000,000,000,000, or a billion dollars by proper international systems of numeration, based on true powers of one million, or a &#8220;trillion&#8221; in the parochial inflated American system of numeration, which based on powers of a thousand, off by one.</p>
<p>That is too much silver platter and too much price on John the Baptist&#8217;s head to be contemplated by honest men.</p>
<p>Not only pornography and classified documents, of course, but all manner of life-ruining slander, libel, privacy violations, copyright violations, murder-for-hire contracts, and blackmail are included in the blockchain ledger.</p>
<p>The iterated computations of SHA-256 hashes are wasteful and inefficient, for all the gold or oil that could be mined for the performance of useful work.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe that the hash functions on which digital currencies are based are irreversible or even all that hard to crack. All that requires is a Viterbi algorithm, or even a classical or quantum annealing algorithm, with a probit, or better yet, a logit model of each bit in the internal state of the hash function. Hash function collisions are regularly reported by scientists and researchers using various methods, unless there&#8217;s money offered under the table to hush them up, while selling an illusion of unbreakable privacy and integrity to the general public.</p>

				<p>With the exception of sending messages to botnets, none of these examples are particularly dangerous. This is the equivalent to the hidden message in Perseverance&#8217;s parachute: a cute trick, but not an efficient way to transmit information. It&#8217;s not like a JPEG hidden in the blockchain will automatically appear on your screen when you open your wallet. Neither the Chinese government nor Disney can suppress information completely, so they work to minimize the value of using that information. Both can have people arrested for using it—to a point. Both can flood social media with information which dilutes the value of the stolen information.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m very surprised no one has commented that full nodes (nodes that validate and mine blocks) can prune confirmed blocks (except I think maybe the last two days?). This removes all the content that is stored in the OP_RETURN abuse and related ways to &#8216;stuff data&#8217;. The only thing nodes keep in prune mode is the hash to verify transactions for the merkle-tree.</p>
<p>The whole history does not have to be stored, nor should it.</p>

				<blockquote><p>The only thing nodes keep in prune mode is the hash to verify transactions for the merkle-tree</p></blockquote>
<p>This is false. It (partially) describes Satoshi&#8217;s original pruning proposal, which was never implemented<br />
Block pruning is a convenience for nodes with insufficent disk space. A pruned node initially downloads the entire history from one or more unpruned nodes, and deletes blocks as it goes</p>
<p>The Bitcoin Blockchain is never pruned</p>

<blockquote><p>Is there actually illegal pornography inside the blockchain, or are there just links?</p></blockquote>
<p>Nobody really knows, because anybody who views or shares the location of child abuse material would be guilty of a crime</p>
<p>The last time the USA authorities started spreading this FUD, exactly 3 years ago, all the same examples and all the same words were published over and over, with no proof. Yes, there are URLs which linked to child abuse material, and it&#8217;s safe to admit that because those links are long dead</p>
<p>The thrust of the debate reveals how much mass opinion diverges from the principles of liberty, always knee-jerking in favor of authoritarian control</p>
<p>Ultimately, it doesn&#8217;t matter. There is a cost to permanent storage of arbitrary data, and the Bitcoin system only levies a cost at the time the data is stored. Eventually, the clever people who drive the direction of the Bitcoin system will have to tweak it for sustainability or watch it slowly die from abuse of the commons. This is a general issue, not specific to the storage of arbitrary data. Bitcoin as a crazy speculation price bubble is much more interesting than a photo of Nelson Mandela and some obsolete photo links</p>

				<p>Leonard Bailey, you may have a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The data that is stored in a transaction for extra data is packed via OP_RETURN which is pruned from UTXO&#8217;s.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L693" rel="nofollow ugc">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L693</a></p>
<p>OP_RETURN fails, so it&#8217;s pruned. Data is stuffed into a NO_OP basically.</p>
<p>The hash can still be used to verify the transaction via a merkle tree comparison, however data absolutely can be pruned. This is the strength of a merkle tree.</p>
