				<p>&#8220;Despite decades of investment in cybersecurity personnel and capabilities, today the congressionally run Government Accountability Office (GAO) says U.S. federal cybersecurity capabilities have regressed from prior years—and federal cybersecurity is currently in the GAO’s category of government programs at high risk of failure. Under the “assume breach” mindset, the GAO’s reasoning is clear. There are no internal walls to prevent breaches from spreading.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is time for a different model for cybersecurity. U.S. military bases have layers of walls, guards, badge readers, and authentication measures to control access. The United States needs the same mindset for its cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Agencies need to adopt an “assume breach” mindset and invest in the security controls required to stop intruders’ internal movements. To “assume breach” in cyberspace means to invest in a comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy to stop intruders from moving freely throughout a network once they’ve broken past the perimeter. What’s more, the government needs to continuously test its security controls to ensure they work. &#8221;</p>

<p>An online tool lets customers pay to unmask the phone numbers of Facebook users that liked a specific Page, and the underlying dataset appears to be separate from the 500 million account database that made headlines this week, signifying another data breach or large scale scraping of Facebook users&#8217; data, Motherboard has found.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, can you tell me how you got my number?&#8221; one person included in the dataset asked Motherboard when reached for comment. &#8220;Omg, this is insane,&#8221; they added. Another person returned Motherboard&#8217;s call and, after confirming their name, said &#8220;If you have my number then yes it seems the data is accurate.&#8221;</p>

				<p>This article from Google Zero Project highlights the importance of collaboration across companies to improving of the overall computer security<br />
as well as what they call offensive security work</p>

<p>“ Furthermore, these changes also highlight the value of offensive security work: not just single bugs were fixed, but instead structural improvements were made based on insights gained from exploit development work.”</p>

				<p>@Mr P<br />
&#8220;For this reason, it is time for a different model for cybersecurity&#8221;</p>
<p>It is clear that USA institutions, e.g., Intelligence Services, Military, and FBI, are all failing in their job of protecting US governmental institutions and citizens.</p>
<p>I blame their insisting on open access to all ICT systems for this failure. As long as offensive needs alwayd overrule defensive needs, no one will be safe.</p>
<p>I see a parallel in USA law enforcement and health care, where punishment and medical cures (i.e., cleaning up the mess) are always prioritized over prevention.</p>

				<p>I try to rationalise the synergy and conflict between security and privacy on a regular basis. Seeing the recent news about mitre and a system for &#8220;guessing&#8221; your name based on your face, or vice versa, I&#8217;m reminded of how bad something like this is for personal privacy and the potential for abuse or misuse. It seems to me as though nation states do not care so much about individual privacy because it hinders their objectives. And individuals mostly care more about privacy because ultimately it is other humans that are in control of our data. And so there is likely to always be a conflict between these two opposing forces, with varying degrees of compromise being reached. I think the mistake is to believe that there is a perfect answer to resolve this conflict. And the bigger mistake is to think that once you have picked a side, that you have any chance of achieving a victory that all will be happy with. I want a national security team that can protect me. But I don&#8217;t want to be spied on or profiled (aware I have not even mentioned fb, Google, or Amazon yet). What are our best options for finding peace in this landscape? Fight for a perfect system, or accept that there will never be one and get on with our lives? Asking for a friend.</p>

				<p><b>Google had a proposal to W3C TAG (Technical Architecture Group) to treat multiple domains as same origin?</b></p>
<p>According to this:<br />
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/08/w3c_google_multple_domains/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/08/w3c_google_multple_domains/</a></p>
<p>This of course would have had an effect on same-origin policies for scripts and other interesting things&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway TAG shut it down saying among other things:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are concerned that this proposal weakens the concept of origin without considering the full implications of this action.&#8221;</p>
<p>They in particular had a concern about it in connection to Google&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://web.dev/digging-into-the-privacy-sandbox/" rel="nofollow ugc">Privacy Sandbox</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s Lead for WebKit development was also concerned about &#8220;bad faith claims,&#8221; adding:.</p>
<p><i>How to prevent domains that are not actually owned and controlled by the same party from making claims of being related? For example, an ad network could get its top publishers to enter an association to regain a certain level of tracking powers.</i></p>
<p>All in all interesting, considering that Google (Alphabet) has probably world&#8217;s largest ad network.</p>

<blockquote><p>What are our best options for finding peace in this landscape? Fight for a perfect system, or accept that there will never be one and get on with our lives? </p></blockquote>
<p>1 &#8216;Best options&#8217; is pretty subjective, but I think I know  what you mean.</p>
<p>2 From a personal perspective: acceptance is much easier on my mental state than worry and anxiety. I&#8217;m mostly ad blind so I don&#8217;t care much that someone uses my profile to send ads that they think will make them money.</p>
<p>3 From a security prospective: doing as much as an individual can do to keep my system(s) clean, updated, and backed up on a frequent basis. And, avoid dodgy websites as best as I can.</p>
<p>3a I don&#8217;t use my extremely expensive portable spying device, jokingly called a cellphone, for anything but making and receiving calls and texting friends and family.</p>
<p>I realize that&#8217;s not much help, but you did ask.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230; where punishment and medical cures (i.e., cleaning up the mess) are always prioritized over prevention.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that there is a whale of a lot more profit to be made in the treatment area than there ever will be in the prevention stage. Big Pharma and the Mega Hospitals have a vested interest in treating the symptoms rather than curing anything.</p>
<p>I shudder to think of what the world would look like if polio was just now being addressed.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Successful eradication of infectious diseases has been achieved twice before, with smallpox and bovine rinderpest.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Recent polio cases arise from two sources, the original &#8216;wild&#8217; poliovirus (WPV), and mutated oral vaccine strains, so-called circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). There were 140 diagnosed WPV cases worldwide in 2020, a decrease from 2019&#8217;s 5-year high, an 81% reduction from the 719 diagnosed cases in 2000 and a 99.96% reduction from the estimated 350,000 cases when the eradication effort began in 1988. Of the three strains of WPV, the last recorded wild case caused by type 2 (WPV2) was in 1999, and WPV2 was declared eradicated in 2015. Type 3 (WPV3) is last known to have caused polio in 2012, and was declared eradicated in 2019.[7] All wild-virus cases since that date have been due to type 1 (WPV1). Vaccines against each of the three types have given rise to emergent strains of cVDPV, with cVDPV2 being most prominent, and such strains caused over 1000 polio cases in 2020.

<p>Some countries are trying for a 3d, other countries plan on keeping a sustainable level of COVID-19, low enough to prevent hospital overload and high enough to prune the ends of the economic cycle tree.</p>

<p>RE that Vice article</p>
<p>It shows that FB sells access to customers based on Commercial Page likes.  FB discontinued allowing commercial page Likes in Jan 2020.  Why?</p>
<p>Mobile phones were compromised in the recent O365 breach.  The tools that were compromised pertain to mobile phone management including MSFT Intune, Authenticator and security services.  This is detailed in their Dec to Feb blog posts.  DHS recently admitted that they replaced all employee phones after their breach.</p>
<p>To breach a mobile phone, you need a phone number.</p>
<p>Perhaps FB and Linked aren’t reporting the 500 Million user leaks as a breach because the data was sold or available to data sharing partners?  According to these court documents filed last year, all it would take is a few bad actors inside at LI to cause massive attacks across the supply chain.  Is this what happened?  <a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2020/07/full-court-document-details-a-class-action-filed-against-microsofts-linkedin-for-brazenly-violating-apple-user-privacy.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2020/07/full-court-document-details-a-class-action-filed-against-microsofts-linkedin-for-brazenly-violating-apple-user-privacy.html</a></p>
<p>It has happened before in 2016.  <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3086942/linkedin-data-breach-blamed-for-multiple-secondary-compromises.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.csoonline.com/article/3086942/linkedin-data-breach-blamed-for-multiple-secondary-compromises.html</a></p>
<p>The danger with allowing phone numbers to be sold or shared is that this may be the attack vector for the MSFT 0365 compromised credentials.</p>
<p>To use this article’s scenario as an example.  Did FB and LI sell access to phone numbers of employees at specific employers?  Was this another way of doing it?  Of course LI and FB data is more valuable when combined.</p>
<p>Isn’t it strange that LI and FB both experienced leaks of 500 Million users in the same week?  Who did this?  Contractors? Do they use the same vendor?</p>
<p>I heard that LI records all password attempts and to be careful about using a password meant for other sites accidentally in LI.  If this is true why would LI do such a thing?  Do other sites do this?  That seems really nefarious if true.</p>
<p>Microsoft promised to abide by CCPA for all Americans, which means they must identify all the data that LI has on us, who has access to that data (internally and externally), what countries our data is stored in or accessible in and the process by which we can correct our data or opt out.  <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/11/11/microsoft-california-privacy-rights/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/11/11/microsoft-california-privacy-rights/</a></p>
<p>The one thing about dishonesty is that at some point you always get caught.  So from a business perspective it is not smart to have a non sustainable business model.  I think social media can be used for good and make money.  It is just a choice.  Perhaps they need new employees with vision.  When you have compliant employees who just play follow the leader, the dynamic creativity and entrepreneurship disappears.  They are stuck in the dark.</p>

<p>re: <i>Achieving Herd Immunity by Vaccination/Recovery or Not </i></p>
<p>UCL = University College London<br />
ICL = Imperial College London</p>
<p>&#8220;Herd Immunity by Vaccination/Recovery&#8221; will achieved in the UK on April 9, 2021.</p>
<ul>
<li>Britain will on Friday achieve herd immunity from Covid-19, according to a forecast from scientists at University College London – which was no sooner made than disputed.</li>
<li>Prof Karl Friston and his UCL colleagues claimed that by 9 April, 73.4% of the population would have immunity either through vaccines or by having been infected with Covid and recovered.</li>
<li>They have added a disclaimer, however.<br />
“Much like long-term weather forecasts, the ensuing predictions should not be taken too seriously because there is an inherent (although quantified) uncertainty about underlying epidemiological and socio-behavioural variables.”</li>
</ul>
<p>There is some dispute about the timing and effect</p>
<ul>
<li>“<b>We need to define herd immunity carefully </b> as we think about the future,”<br />
Prof Christl Donnelly, of Oxford University and Imperial College London (ICL) </li>
</ul>
<p>So far the best ever analysis of what this really means in the current context from the journalist reporter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A year, three lockdowns and 127,000 deaths later, it is clear that even with very effective vaccines, herd immunity – in the sense of the end of any spread of the virus – would be very much harder to achieve than was supposed then.</p>
<p>Manaus, on the Amazon river in Brazil, was thought last summer to have achieved herd immunity. Tests on donated blood suggested 66% of people had antibodies against the virus in July, following a devastating first wave of infection. By October that had risen to 76%. And then in January a second wave hit, hospitals were overwhelmed and patients’ relatives pleaded for oxygen cylinders because the city had run out. Between 25% and 61% of those infected had already had one bout of Covid. They were not immune.</p>
<p>The P1 variant was responsible for the savage second wave. It is now known to have a mutation called E484K that confers some resistance to vaccines and antibodies against the regular virus. The tale of Manaus was a salutary one – that Covid could never be allowed to run its course in hopes of generating herd immunity.</p>
<p>&emsp; Sarah Boseley Fri 9 Apr 2021 10.19 EDT

<li>UCL team’s claim that herd immunity set to be achieved in UK disputed<br />
Many scientists critical of University College London Covid-19 forecast as ‘over-confident and over-optimistic’</li>

<blockquote><p>2 out of thousands. Polio is not yet one of them.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m aware. I was thinking of the competing Pharma Companies, and the subsequent differences between the Salk and Sabin vaccines. It took several years for the results to be recognized and the fallout reduced.</p>
<p>I remember being jealous of the new kids who only had to eat a sugar cube compared to the two painful injections I received.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;other countries plan on keeping a sustainable level of COVID-19, low enough to prevent hospital overload and high enough to prune the ends of the economic cycle tree.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect that, whether planned or unplanned, COVID-19 is here to stay. In one variant or another.</p>

<p>I was lucky I got the sugar cube for polio but I also got the pin cushion for smallpox.</p>
<p>Remember smallpox?</p>
<p>They put this goo on your skin and then pricked the area like a sewing machine needle.  The size of the scar area varies.</p>
<p>They also decided not to tell folks that the immunity faded in time. iirc(badly) about 10 years.</p>
<p>They also decide not to give any boosters or renew vaccinations.</p>
<p>Because?</p>
<p>The only stocks of smallpox are in biological warfare labs around the world and they&#8217;ve been busy bees making it more virulent and deadlier.</p>
<p>The original vaccine may no longer be useful.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>ht tps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_vaccine<br />
ht tps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_vaccine#Vaccine_stockpiles</p>
<ul>
<li>From 1958 to 1977, the World Health Organization conducted a global vaccination campaign that eradicated smallpox, making it the only human disease to be eradicated. Although routine smallpox vaccination is no longer performed on the general public, the vaccine is still being produced to guard against bioterrorism and biological warfare. </li>
