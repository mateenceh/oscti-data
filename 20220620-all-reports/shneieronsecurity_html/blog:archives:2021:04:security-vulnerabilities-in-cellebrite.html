		<h2 class="entry">Security Vulnerabilities in Cellebrite</h2>
		<p>Moxie Marlinspike has an intriguing <a href="https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/">blog post</a> about <a href="https://www.cellebrite.com/en/home/">Cellebrite</a>, a tool used by police and others to break into smartphones. Moxie got his hands on one of the devices, which seems to be a pair of Windows software packages and a whole lot of connecting cables.</p>
<p>According to Moxie, the software is riddled with vulnerabilities. (The one example he gives is that it uses FFmpeg DLLs from 2012, and have not been patched with the 100+ security updates since then.)</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;we found that it&#8217;s possible to execute arbitrary code on a Cellebrite machine simply by including a specially formatted but otherwise innocuous file in any app on a device that is subsequently plugged into Cellebrite and scanned. There are virtually no limits on the code that can be executed.</p></blockquote>
<p>This means that Cellebrite has one &#8212; or many &#8212; remote code execution bugs, and that a specially designed file on the target phone can infect Cellebrite.</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, by including a specially formatted but otherwise innocuous file in an app on a device that is then scanned by Cellebrite, it&#8217;s possible to execute code that modifies not just the Cellebrite report being created in that scan, but also <i>all previous and future generated Cellebrite</i> reports from all previously scanned devices and all future scanned devices in any arbitrary way (inserting or removing text, email, photos, contacts, files, or any other data), with no detectable timestamp changes or checksum failures. This could even be done at random, and would seriously call the data integrity of Cellebrite&#8217;s reports into question.</p></blockquote>
<p>That malicious file could, for example, insert fabricated evidence or subtly alter the evidence it copies from a phone. It could even write that fabricated/altered evidence back to the phone so that from then on, even an uncorrupted version of Cellebrite will find the altered evidence on that phone.</p>
<p>Finally, Moxie suggests that future versions of Signal will include such a file, sometimes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Files will only be returned for accounts that have been active installs for some time already, and only probabilistically in low percentages based on phone number sharding.</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea, of course, is that a defendant facing Cellebrite evidence in court can claim that the evidence is tainted.</p>
<p>I have no idea how effective this would be in court. Or whether this runs foul of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the US. (Is it okay to booby-trap your phone?) A colleague from the UK says that this would not be legal to do under the Computer Misuse Act, although it&#8217;s hard to blame the phone owner if he doesn&#8217;t even know it&#8217;s happening.</p>

				<p>I guess here the Cellebrite is the one to blame for keeping its software unpatched for so long to make it vulnerable to this type of attack. If a piece of software resides on a computer and it patches law enforcement computers when they collect evidence, should the developer of that software be blamed?</p>

				<p>Since 2012 is a long time.  It seems a lot of phone data is in need of an audit.<br />
To promptly patch and update these systems risks tainting any previous assertions of evidence. And looks like a coverup.</p>
<p>Sloppy at best.<br />
Sloppy contaminates expert testimony and warrants  depending on it.</p>
<p>Lots of turtles here.</p>

				<p>re: &#8220;A colleague from the UK says that this would not be legal to do under the Computer Misuse Act&#8221;.</p>
<p>I can see that anything that can be summarised as hacking the Cellebrite machine would be illegal. However what I&#8217;d do is detect the Cellebrite connection, and pass across a spoofed contents of the phone.</p>

				<p>I think the beauty here is that nobody needs to actually do anything illegal. The blog post may be enough to establish that it is plausible the evidence was tainted. Also, note that they did not specifically announce they would employ such exploits, they just heavily implied it (while giving technical details that basically say &#8220;good luck trying to figure out if we&#8217;re actually doing this&#8221;)</p>

<blockquote><p>If a piece of software resides on a computer and it patches law enforcement computers when they collect evidence, should the developer of that software be blamed?</p></blockquote>
<p>If it were any other kind of product sold on a consumer market that software is, then the answer would be &#8220;Yes&#8221; both morally and legally (see consumer &#8220;fit for purpose&#8221; legislation in many nations).</p>

				<p>@ Tim H, jamez,</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s still burglary if you steal stuff from the house of the person who burgled you…</p></blockquote>
<p>Wrong comparative model to use.</p>
<p>Look at it this way, you have a fragile vase that a burglar steels, in the process the burglar breaks it and cuts their hand badly, fails to use medical assistance and becomes seriously ill/dies of an infection.</p>
<p>The Cellebrite software is trespassing and taking copies of private data, it is taking by copying without the owners permission. The fact that Cellebrite developers are inept / incompetent is the sole reason this is possible, should not be used as an argument against people taking reasonable precautions to protect their privacy. Otherwise it would be illegal to have curtains at your windows such that you can have privacy.</p>
<p>But think of it as those money boxes used to carry currency from place to place, they have anti-tamper devices that spray dye all over the money to make it usless to the thief.</p>
<p>This is the principle by which these files Moxie infers might appear on phones works behind.</p>
<p>@ Bruce,</p>
<blockquote><p>Is it okay to booby-trap your phone?</p></blockquote>
<p>Wrong point of view, you are not booby-trapping your phone, other software would not suffer from these otherwise benign files.</p>
<p>It is purely a fault in Cellebrite software due to the two fold failings of Cellebrite,</p>
<p>1, By the software developers failing to do a sufficient or workman like job (which would be a crime in it&#8217;s own right).</p>
<p>2, Cellebrite knowingly seting up a selling-model where their software falls into the hands of people who mainly use it in manners that are either illegal or at best very moaraly questionable.</p>
<p>As for your UK friend, I think you should ask for their reasoning, I suspect there is a fault in their otherwise valid reasoning.</p>
<p>That fault being the question of who is breaking into whos computer.</p>
<p>That is it is the cellebrite software attacking a users passive phone, not the users phone attacking the cellebeite system.</p>
<p>@ ALL,</p>
<p>There is an old saying from William Shakespeare, that applies rather more apptly for Cellebrite than it does for many other uses.</p>
<p>That is Cellebrite,</p>
<p>&#8220;Are hoist by their own petard&#8221;</p>
<p>Which alone is reason enough to raise a smile.</p>

				<p>Hacking somebody&#8217;s phone is illegal. to begin with.<br />
It&#8217;s recently been ruled that hacking back in self-defense is perfectly legal.<br />
Why not do this in every install?</p>

				<p>That did not take long.  There is another case in the works.</p>
<p>Lawyer Asks For New Trial After Cellebrite Vulnerability Discovery</p>

<blockquote><p>A defense attorney has asked a judge to grant their client a new trial after Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of popular encrypted messaging app Signal, found security issues with mobile phone forensics hardware made by Cellebrite. The case heavily used evidence collected by a Cellebrite device, according to the motion for a new trial obtained by Motherboard.</p></blockquote>

				<p>All of the &#8220;mobile optimized&#8221; versions of major websites require huge, heaping mounds of. flash and/or javascript, and thus require dropping to the lowest security level.<br />
Most users will gladly disable all the security to make their favorite sites work again.<br />
Therefor, please make &#8220;Use Desktop Version&#8221; enabled by default in Tor Browser for smartphones/tablets.</p>
<p>Anybody who has a real need to access the flash version for some reason, and understands the security risks of flash and javascript, can easily disable the desktop version and opt-in to the ActiveX/Flash/Javascript version if they want to for whatever possible reason.<br />
But the defaults should be sane; not random, nor deliberately harmful.</p>
<p>^&#8212;- tried to make a ticket at torproject but needs all kinds of registration now. 🙁</p>

<p>comment-373479 is totally off-topic for this article and is bs as flash is dead.</p>
<p>If it had been posted to prior squid, it would almost have fit in.</p>

				<p>@All</p>
<p>The existence of the safe-file is like a warrant canary.  One that gets exchanged at some random(?) time interval.  The canary file does not exist on all phones; it&#8217;s on some phones and not others.</p>
<p>It would seem that there is a trigger that happens when the file is scanned or checked, that begins the data-scramble. It&#8217;s not clear that the data-scramble happens on phones that do not have the warrant canary.</p>
<p>The canary file appears to be targeted for phones of &#8220;high value VIP&#8221; types, but often the path of most LEO success is with the lesser-minnows where data might be extracted easier, because they may be less aware of their target value.</p>
<p>The ability to change data without audit traces, has been known for some time now.  It&#8217;s not a new factor in the data-scarfer-races.  It&#8217;s only been a matter of time and legal interest to challenge all digital data for integrity.   There is no guarantee that any data on the web, archives, in digital format has not been tampered with.</p>
<p>The only reason it has not been challenged so far, has been a &#8220;public belief&#8221; that data has not been altered because the LEOs normally present their findings as &#8220;un-challenged fact&#8221;.  Recent discussions on: time, forensics and other similarly submitted &#8220;science&#8221; has reviewed a number of flaws in these beliefs.</p>
<p>There is also the condition of Bad Programming producing Bad Data that appears to be Good Data but takes a lot of digging to find out that it&#8217;s not.  In the USA the State/Feds have unlimited access to funds, science, investigators for the prosecution. The defendant has &#8220;his pocket-wallet&#8221; and public defenders cannot compete with the scope of resources arrayed against them.</p>
<p>It is one factor in &#8220;plea bargaining&#8221; systems, to declaim to the court you are guilty when you are not, in order to avoid longer jail terms and fines.  The data against you goes unchallenged as &#8220;fact&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the USA, UK and AU such bargaining now leads to some serious situations. People are having their citizenship stripped and being deported to &#8220;ancestral homelands&#8221; based on the up-scaling of charges to hit the &#8220;threshold&#8221; for deportation and citizenship revocation.</p>
<p>iirc(badly) tl;dr</p>
<blockquote><p>
A person received an automatic ticket for running a red light.  In the USA the fine is high and you get demerits on your driving record.  If you garner enough demerits you lose your license to drive and much that goes with it. </p>
<p>&emsp; Driving is a Privilege not A Right &#8211; USA</p>
<p>The person was certain they had not run the light and challenged the ticket.  Pictures and timestamps showed the light red when the car passed the intersection.</p>
<p>The person was able to hire some good lawyers and tech folks to look into the automated red light ticket system.  All checked out.  </p>
<p>It looked like the person would have to pay the fines and take the demerit.</p>
<p>One of the tech persons, went physically to the street in question and looked for the pressure trigger lines in the street.  There was a problem.</p>
<p>It turned out the street had been repaved and the street paver has replaced the pressure lines some distance away from their original spec location.  The trigger went off sooner than it was supposed to.</p>
<p>A whole lot of folks had gotten red light tickets that never ran the light.  They paid the fines and took the demerit to avoid the hassle of paying lawyers and court costs.</p>
<p>Only the one person, knowing the data could not be true challenged the system.
</p></blockquote>

It goes along the lines of wireshark exploits, and certain file formats that if a parser program like recycle bin reads, it corrupts it.<br />
I&#8217;m guessing, but I doubt the patch they released acutely fixed the first part of the path that caused the exploit, more like mov eip 0x41414141 they changed to xor esp, ebp, saying that I don&#8217;t think they should be to cock sure at this stage.</p>

<p>You are missing the point.</p>
<p>An exploit does not have to exist, just the possibility that an exploit can exist.  Which certainly is the case. This is Windows.</p>
<p>Cellebrite is dancing in a Security Threatre.</p>
<p>There is ZERO CHANCE they are trustable.</p>

				<blockquote><p>I have no idea how effective this would be in court. Or whether this runs foul of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the US. (Is it okay to booby-trap your phone?) A colleague from the UK says that this would not be legal to do under the Computer Misuse Act</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder &#8211; some reasonable levels of protection of private property that might pose a small danger to intruders are often permissible if suitable warnings are prominently posted. If you had a sticker on the back of your phone saying &#8220;Device protected by Signal counter-hacking measures.&#8221;, or &#8220;By connecting to this device, you grant its owner permission to access yours in return.&#8221;, or similar, might this provide a plausible defence against people trying to breach your device without your consent?</p>

<p>No I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;ve always said you shouldn&#8217;t use computer evedince in court, and I think I said it on this site. I was explain to another poster you could compare wireshark and celbrite exploit as the same logic.</p>

				<p>I used to work for computer forensic company. I remember undergoing GREAT pains to harden the software against corrupt/malicious files. It slowed development and code writing, but was the right thing to do. We used static code analysis, fuzzing, code reviews, crash dumps, code coverage and other tools.<br />
I still remember one corruption where the processes would disappear &#8211; this was due to such corrupted memory that when windows tried to write a crash dump it crashed (in the crash handler) making the process disappear.<br />
I the wrote an out of proc debugger that then wrote a dump file out.</p>
<p>In later years wrong people were hired and things went down the tubes.</p>
<p>On a related note, the company had their own version of cellebrite including a farady bag with copper fabric and such. This was before cellebrite and back then there were 200+ connectors to tap into the JTAG/diag connectors to read out physical EEPROM.</p>
<p>The file system was then re-built from that.</p>
<p>The myriad of different phones with tiny lifetimes killed that product. Unlike now where Iphones and samsung are 50% of the market</p>

I haven&#8217;t worked for fresic, but I did download from a Romaine site what police used, didn&#8217;t do to much experiment, it stop write access, own hardware, and f$$k a USB port, but its a minimal interface, just hash, and copy.<br />
The hash process could have a bug, the keneral hardware DLL or the main program.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, that brings back memories of USB write-blockers. The company developed a &#8220;software one&#8221; then later acquired a hardware based-company.</p>
<p>Most of the issues are in the parsing; acquisition is just copy a block of bytes over.<br />
That being said there were issues in the USB device auth that could reboot[1] the system&#8230; and it was never tracked down. Too expensive</p>
<p>[1] I also got a NTFS drive that caused a blue screen on boot. when booted into safe mode it would NOT blue-screen. Where was the KERNEL bug?</p>
<p>In the NTFS driver! Specifically in the $Log file. it was corrupted. The $Log file helps unroll transactions in the case of a crash. Usually. This time a length field was 0xffffffff, that caused a buffer overflow/memory corruption.</p>
<p>It blue-screened machine that the dive was plugged into ( via USB )<br />
I made a flash drive out of it and thus was able to prank a deserving cow-worker.</p>
<p>I also reported this to MSFT and it was patched. I was too busy to see if this could yield kernel code execution</p>
