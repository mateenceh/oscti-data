		<h2 class="entry">The FBI Is Now Securing Networks Without Their Owners’ Permission</h2>
		<p>In January, we <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/03/more-on-the-chinese-zero-day-microsoft-exchange-hack.html">learned about</a> a Chinese espionage campaign that exploited <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/03/four-microsoft-exchange-zero-days-exploited-by-china.html">four zero-days</a> in Microsoft Exchange. One of the characteristics of the campaign, in the later days when the Chinese probably realized that the vulnerabilities would soon be fixed, was to install a web shell in compromised networks that would give them subsequent remote access. Even if the vulnerabilities were patched, the shell would remain until the network operators removed it.</p>
<p>Now, months later, many of those shells are still in place. And they&#8217;re being used by criminal hackers as well.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the FBI announced that it <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dmjg/fbi-removes-web-shells-microsoft-exchange">successfully</a> <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/vulnerabilities/doj-used-court-orders-to-thwart-hundreds-of-exchange-server-web-shells/">received</a> a court order to remove &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of these web shells from networks in the US.</p>
<p>This is nothing short of extraordinary, and I can think of no real-world parallel. It&#8217;s kind of like if a criminal organization infiltrated a door-lock company and surreptitiously added a master passkey feature, and then customers bought and installed those locks. And then if the FBI got a court order to fix all the locks to remove the master passkey capability. And it&#8217;s kind of not like that. In any case, it&#8217;s not what we normally think of when we think of a warrant. The links above have details, but I would like a legal scholar to weigh in on the implications of this.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;d actually be more okay with Joe Random &#8220;Vigilantly&#8221; scanning for and crippling web shells than the FBI doing it. Which is not to say I&#8217;d be particularly okay with either.</p>
<p>That said, scan-and-notify? That I could get behind, but still; not the FBI&#8217;s jobs.</p>

				<p>It would be very interesting to know how they square these actions with the 4th Amendment?</p>

				<p>I&#8217;d actually much prefer if these vulnerable machines were just removed from the net (I&#8217;m assuming they were notified months ago). The organizations running them needs to see the cost of no action.</p>

				<p>Under the 4th Amendment the FBI needs a warrant to take two actions: search and/or seize things. Clearly, in order to fix a backdoor they needed to search for it on the offending hardware, so they needed a warrant for that (assuming that some other doctrine like plain view does not apply) and and if what they did was just delete a file then certainly that would count as a seizure. It is well settled that when the government destroys something they have seized it. So a warrant is needed there. The real world parallel would be when the government destroys confiscated goods, such as drugs, after the criminal prosecution is over. They don&#8217;t normally need a warrant for that, however, because the goods have already been previously legally seized. The fact that the file was seized from a third party is not a problem.</p>
<p>There may be a 5A problem here of taking private property without just compensation but I&#8217;m not sure who would claim the property interest in the backdoor, assuming one could be claimed. So I am dubious of that angle.</p>
<p>The question then becomes whether or not the actions by the FBI were reasonable. For that, I would need to do a deep dive into the court order and case law. Ask Orin Kerr, he&#8217;s probably more up to date on it. My gut reaction is that it probably legal but that is a tentative conclusion.</p>

				<p>Because the shells are usable by anyone who knows about them, a better analogy might be an antagonist opened windows in a number of homes for the purpose of gaining entry later and the FBI received warrants allowing them to trespass in order to shut those windows.</p>

				<p>This seems like a bad idea. It sets the precedent that the FBI can act to secure private systems, and the precedent that it&#8217;s the FBI&#8217;s <em>responsibility</em> to do so. I can imagine the word &#8220;secure&#8221; being reinterpreted over time to mean pretty much whatever they want it to mean.  Hopefully there&#8217;s language in here which limits the scope to this particular exceptional situation.</p>
<p>@Bruce, if you do find any discussion by a legal scholar please give us a link. I&#8217;d like to read it too.</p>
<p>I wonder if any security researchers have existing honeypots using this compromise, which the FBI will shut down.  I also wonder if any researchers are going to quickly set up a honeypot system specifically to snare the FBI and find out exactly what they&#8217;re doing when they&#8217;re poking around &#8220;securing&#8221; it.</p>

				<p>@Tom</p>
<p>If they have a warrant then by definition law enforcement is not trespassing.</p>
<p>@Bruce</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the best analogy I would come up with. Rancher Tom owns a big cattle ranch in Texas with lots of barns on it. Unknown to him, his best friend Bob is using those barns to store illicit drugs in transit from one state to another. A mutual friend of Bob and Tom learns of the scheme and tells Tom about it. Tom laughs and says Bob would never do a thing like that and never even goes to looks in his barns. So the mutual friend turns informant to the FBI. The FBI gets a warrant, searches the barns, seizes the drugs, and then destroys them to help &#8220;fix the problem of illicit drug trafficking&#8221;.</p>
<p>Where exact;y is the problem with what the FBI did? Is that problem the motive the FBI had for seizing the drugs which seems too generic? Is the problem that the FBI had a warrant for lots of locations at once so it looks like a general warrant? Is the problem that there was no way to seize the contraband without destroying it (in the case of the computer file)? If there is anyone of these three that bothers me it&#8217;s the second but that is more of a technical problem than a policy problem. Otherwise the warrant seems right to me.</p>

				<p>I cannot comment on the legal side of this but let me weigh in on the technical side.</p>
<p>Essentially, the FBI had the following options:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Do nothing</em>. Given that these webshells were very widespread (like, on hundreds of thousands of computers), and that the owners of the affected computers did nothing to remediate the situation (either because they couldn&#8217;t or because they didn&#8217;t care), this would have been a sub-optimal decision. The webshells were initially meant for espionage but after the bug became public all sorts of cyber criminals started using them, from installing cryptominers to ransomwaring the companies affected.</li>
<li><em>Fix the problem properly</em>. In this case this means (a) removing the webshell, (b) closing the vulnerability, and (c) cleaning the machine from any other malware installed on it. Unfortunately, (b) means updating the Exchange server, which is far from a trivial thing to do even for an experienced local system administrator. The FBI messing with it remotely would have beeb guaranteed to cause damage to some systems. Similarly, (c) requires a full incident response engagement, which is again hard to do remotely and without the owner&#8217;s consent and cooperation. It&#8217;s not a matter of &#8220;remove this known malware&#8221; &#8211; it is a matter of &#8220;do a full investigation of the machine and the network it is connected to and try to figure out what the attackers might have done to it&#8221;. Clearly impractical and error-prone.</li>
<li><em>Remove the easy access vector (the webshells) and try to notify the owner</em>. This is a kind of a compromise and while certainly not the best and most rigorous solution, it strikes me as better than doing nothing and less likely to cause damage than if they did anything more.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, from a technical point of view, I think that they did they best, given the circumstances.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t make sense to me either. It&#8217;s Microsoft Corporation proprietary software, sold &#8220;as is&#8221;, off the shelf without any implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone is successfully suing Microsoft for damages over it, and moreover the issuance of security patches and removal of web shells are all part of Microsoft&#8217;s normal business &#8212; which Microsoft or any major corporation would be doing anyways &#8212; and then there are D.O.J. employees showing up for work all of a sudden on a court-ordered basis at a private enterprise &#8212; outside their normal purview of crime and punishment &#8212; without any direction from supervisors or coordination from other employees who are already working on Microsoft software, and doing everything they can to fix the problems &#8212; which the government is only making worse by their meddling.</p>
<p>But every courthouse in the United States is running on Microsoft&#8217;s legal-industry-specific software products. Lexis-Nexis databases, title deed and recording software, court filing software, etc. So some guy is going to end up in the federal penitentiary, and all the court records will be deleted, altered, or hacked on Microsoft software, and after a few years, nobody can even look up any records as to why the guy&#8217;s in prison, but they&#8217;re never going to let him out, because he&#8217;s been classified as a violent felon in the federal prison population.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder what they classify as &#8220;violent crime&#8221; or not, because pulling the trigger of a handgun with your finger is no more violent than striking a key on a computer keyboard with the same finger &#8212; and consequences no longer matter in court &#8212; because modern courts no longer require the third of three elements necessary to convict a crime since the time of the ancient Romans, namely</p>
<p>#1. <strong>mens rea</strong>;<br />
#2. <strong>actus reus</strong>; &amp;<br />
#3. <strong><em>noxa rea</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The ancient Romans insisted that <strong>if (#1)</strong> it wasn&#8217;t something you intended to do, <strong>or (#2)</strong> it wasn&#8217;t something you really did, <strong>or (#3)</strong> you did not really harm anyone &#8212; <strong>then</strong> you didn&#8217;t commit a crime, and therefore you could not be convicted of a crime.</p>
<p>Modern courts on the other hand have repealed the classical third necessary element of conviction for crime, and omitted due process by either imposing punishment for harmless or victimless acts, or by falsely imputing harm (<em>noxa</em>) where none exists.</p>

<p>And in fact that&#8217;s exactly the way “Microsoft Exchange Server” is sold.</p>
<p>You need a software license key or possibly even some physical token from Microsoft to use it, and if you don’t have the software license key or hardware dongle or whatever is required, or if you are found to have circumvented some DMCA provisions, then you will definitely be fined and/or imprisoned for possessing “counterfeit” software, or violating the copyright on Microsoft’s proprietary software code.</p>

				<p>&#8220;FBI personnel will access the web shells, enter passwords, make an evidentiary copy of the web shell, and then issue a command through each&#8221; of the web shells&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;the FBI is attempting to inform all owners of the impacted computers about the operation&#8230;&#8221;</p>

				<p>I do not see the legal problem here. The FBI obtained a court order, so they are in the clear.</p>
<p>If anyone, only the owners of the computers affected have standing to object to that procedure. They can go to a higher court and claim this order was unlawful and broke their civil rights.</p>
<p>Somehow, I do not see that happening.</p>

				<p>@ Bruce, ALL,</p>
<p>Looking not on the legal side but the practical side of a US Gov agency carrying out such an order and where it could lead.</p>
<p>In theory this time the &#8220;malware&#8221; was &#8220;safe to remove&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>But most of us know it would have beem fairly easy for those puting this web shell onto machines to make it &#8220;embedded&#8221;[1].That way removing such a web shell becomes not the moderate risk this one apparently is, but high risk.</p>
<p>The problem is that the FBI have now set &#8220;expectations&#8221; that they will not just find systems that have been attacked, but clean them up.</p>
<p>That is many would now argue that the FBI has taken on the job of &#8220;securing the premises&#8221; after a burglary. That is that the FBI techs fix any such attack in future.</p>
<p>Well this has a knock on effect of it&#8217;s own.</p>
<p>Some may remember FBI &amp; DoJ v Apple, where Apple argued that they had no obligations under some ancient bit of law to be &#8220;impressed into servitude&#8221;. Whilst the case got droped when the FBI&amp;DoJ were fairly clearly going to loose thus have president set against them, this could rise again.</p>
<p>Thus the FBI could compel US companies to &#8220;fix the problem&#8221; for them. Whilst some would argue this is a good thing I would not for a couple of reasons,</p>
<p>1, This attack supposadly used four zero days, this time all in a single supplers code. But next time if it&#8217;s four different companies code and one or more decide to argue in court etc?</p>
<p>2, Who carries the liability when things go wrong as they inevitably will do?</p>
<p>3, How long befor the FBI &amp; DoJ start to &#8220;broaden the scope&#8221; of compulsion to install back doors and the like as they originally tried to do with Apple?</p>
<p>Thus this action can be seen as partvof a salami slicing style approach where the FBI &amp; DoJ get nearer their goals a tiny step at a time thus drag the judiciary little by little in a direction they would never go down if it was a single large step.</p>
<p>[1] That if for the web shell on instalation to have made a few shall we say &#8220;apparently random&#8221; changes to the sysyem it was on. So that in effect there were say 2^8 different web shell removal proceadures, get any one step wrong and the system either gets slagged or becomes toast. Thus making the web shell much more problematic to remove thus safer from removal from the attackers perspective.</p>

				<p>If the courts can allow the FBI can round-up Japanese Americans and intern them, what&#8217;s to stop them from taking servers and interning them?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see a problem, and anyway the new immigrants who will develop the new America in a new mold, don&#8217;t even use email.</p>

				<p>@ Bob Easton, ALL</p>
<p>This is entirely legal without subpoena.  In the recent Defense Authorization Act the Cybersecurity Vulnerability and Notification Act was included.  <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/s3045" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/s3045</a></p>
<p>Even though it says it didn’t pass.  Read carefully that it was embedded in another passed bill.</p>
<p>This bill gives the government the ability to force telcos to ID who is vulnerable.  The government can then fix that vulnerability without subpoena or notification to the vulnerable party.  Includes both government agencies and the private sector.</p>
<p>If the FBI is reading this, please fix my devices.  Tech support at one of Big Tech told me yesterday that I need to abandon and disassociate from anything associated with a Microsoft ID.  They did not disagree when I asked if they were telling me to discard my devices too.  When I hung up with them, they shut down my connection to their cloud and all of their services to my devices.  I know that my personal devices are compromised due to my former employer.   It is getting worse.</p>
<p>It’s awful for everyone to pretend that this is just impacting businesses, because if it propagated through Authenticator it’s hitting everyone that used it.</p>
<p>I wish I knew what PowerShell scripts to look for.  Does anyone know of a PowerShell cheat sheet where I can look up by Event ID and see whether it’s ok?</p>

				<p>But I also suspect that the FBI won’t be able to help those organizations relying on offshore MSP’s which is about 90% of the critical infrastructure, including government agencies .  To protect them, they may need to cut off their MSP.</p>
<p>I think the most risk is coming from MSP’s. No one even knew that SolarWinds was installed,  Arms length contracting is the norm.</p>
