		<h2 class="entry">AIs and Fake Comments</h2>
		<p>This month, the New York state attorney general issued a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/oag-fakecommentsreport.pdf">report</a> on a scheme by &#8220;U.S. Companies and Partisans [to] Hack Democracy.&#8221; This wasn’t another attempt by Republicans to make it harder for Black people and urban residents to vote. It was a concerted attack on another core element of US democracy ­&#8211; the ability of citizens to express their voice to their political representatives. And it was carried out by generating millions of fake comments and fake emails purporting to come from real citizens.</p>
<p>This attack was detected because it was relatively crude. But artificial intelligence technologies are making it possible to generate genuine-seeming comments at scale, drowning out the voices of real citizens in a tidal wave of fake ones.</p>
<p>As political scientists like Paul Pierson have <a href="http://www.henryfarrell.net/nixonland.pdf">pointed out</a>, what happens between elections is important to democracy. Politicians shape policies and they make laws. And citizens can approve or condemn what politicians are doing, through contacting their representatives or commenting on proposed rules.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what should happen. But as the New York report shows, it often doesn&#8217;t. The big telecommunications companies paid millions of dollars to specialist &#8220;AstroTurf&#8221; companies to generate public comments. These companies then stole people’s names and email addresses from old files and from hacked data dumps and attached them to <a href="https://twitter.com/NewYorkStateAG/status/1390298453201362944">8.5 million</a> public comments and half a million letters to members of Congress. All of them said that they supported the corporations’ position on something called “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/guide-net-neutrality/">net neutrality</a>,” the idea that telecommunications companies must treat all Internet content equally and not prioritize any company or service. Three AstroTurf companies &#8212; Fluent, Opt-Intelligence and React2Media ­&#8211; agreed to pay nearly $4 million in fines.</p>
<p>The fakes were crude. Many of them were identical, while others were patchworks of simple textual variations: substituting &#8220;Federal Communications Commission&#8221; and &#8220;FCC&#8221; for each other, for example.</p>
<p>Next time, though, we won&#8217;t be so lucky. New technologies are about to make it far easier to generate enormous numbers of convincing personalized comments and letters, each with its own word choices, expressive style and pithy examples. The people who create fake grass-roots organizations have always been enthusiastic early adopters of technology, weaponizing letters, faxes, emails and Web comments to manufacture the appearance of public support or public outrage.</p>
<p>Take Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, or GPT-3, an AI model created by OpenAI, a San Francisco based start-up. With minimal prompting, GPT-3 can generate convincing seeming <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/robot-wrote-this-article-gpt-3">newspaper articles</a>, résumé <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-used-ai-write-cover-letter-application-google-jacob-jacquet">cover letters</a>, even Harry Potter fan fiction in the <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#fnref32">style of Ernest Hemingway</a>. It is trivially easy to use these techniques to compose large numbers of public comments or letters to lawmakers.</p>
<p>OpenAI restricts access to GPT-3, but in a recent experiment, researchers used a different text-generation program to <a href="https://techscience.org/a/2019121801/">submit 1,000 comments</a> in response to a government request for public input on a Medicaid issue. They all sounded unique, like real people advocating a specific policy position. They fooled the Medicaid.gov administrators, who accepted them as genuine concerns from actual human beings. The researchers subsequently identified the comments and asked for them to be removed, so that no actual policy debate would be unfairly biased. Others won&#8217;t be so ethical.</p>
<p>When the floodgates open, democratic speech is in danger of drowning beneath a tide of fake letters and comments, tweets and Facebook posts. The danger isn&#8217;t just that fake support can be generated for unpopular positions, as happened with net neutrality. It is that public commentary will be completely discredited. This would be bad news for specialist AstroTurf companies, which would have no business model if there isn&#8217;t a public that they can pretend to be representing. But it would empower still further other kinds of lobbyists, who at least can prove that they are who they say they are.</p>
<p>We may have a brief window to shore up the flood walls. The most effective response would be to regulate what UCLA sociologist Edward Walker has described as the “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grassroots-Hire-Consultants-American-Democracy/dp/1107619017">grassroots for hire</a>” industry. Organizations that deliberately fabricate citizen voices shouldn&#8217;t just be subject to civil fines, but to criminal penalties. Businesses that hire these organizations should be held liable for failures of oversight. It’s impossible to prove or disprove whether telecommunications companies knew their subcontractors would create bogus citizen voices, but a liability standard would at least give such companies an incentive to find out. This is likely to be politically difficult to put in place, though, since so many powerful actors benefit from the status quo.</p>
<p>This essay was written with Henry Farrell, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/05/20/ai-bots-grassroots-astroturf/">previously appeared</a> in the <i>Washington Post</i>.</p>
<p>EDITED TO ADD: CSET <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/truth-lies-and-automation/">published</a> an excellent report on AI-generated partisan content. Short summary: it&#8217;s pretty good, and will continue to get better. Renee DeRista has also <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/09/future-propaganda-will-be-computer-generated/616400/">written about this</a>.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/2gnso48a/release/8">paper</a> is about a lower-tech version of this threat. Also <a href="https://mediamanipulation.org/case-studies/astroturfing-how-hijacked-accounts-and-dark-public-relations-faked-support-chinas">this</a>.</p>

				<p>Another solution is to issue digital identities to our citizens and have them put their smart cards/NFC/USB device in and push the button to sign their comments. Trusted digital identities issued by the government would solve a lot of problems, although it would probably cause a few too.</p>

				<p>There&#8217;s currently an organised and massive denial of service attack on the UK&#8217;s Freedom of Information law and propaganda exercise by pummelling state organisations with fishing expedition FOI&#8217;s with perjorative language which have interations with human rights organisations. This is all designed to cause doubt in a fragile political climate or undermine FOI law to the point where a review is likely to remove it or weaken it beyond any usefulness.</p>
<p>At the same time there is concerted media attacks on certain human rights issues as well as vexetious legal actions designed to weaken human rights law or weaken and skew perception of these laws.</p>
<p>All of this is a wedge campaign.</p>
<p>Laws do exist such as the human rights act and equality act and communications acts and Prevent acts. Case law exists to establish the point at which cumulative action crosses the threshold of criminality and I&#8217;m fairly sure there is enough law to indicate common cause and bad faith actors. The fraud act may apply in some circumstances when the documents created are improper in any way. I&#8217;m not a lawyer nor expert in these areas but I&#8217;m fairly sure someone can make something of it if they wanted to so some kind of approach can be constructed.</p>
<p>Because of the national security issues (human rights and access to services and democracy) as well as criminal aspects and sometimes substantial burden of these camapigns not just on the state apparatus but third parties includign human rights organisations and citizens who may be affected by the general action or particular focus of a campaign I feel this places issues within the remit of the National Crime Office. Some hotbutton issues require special protection which is covered by the Public Sector Equality Duty.</p>
<p>My sense is the law and protection mechanisms do exist. The hard part is simply coming up with a codified approach which provides protection while not compromising the essential functions of society.</p>
<p>Certain bad actors definately have a love of new gimmicks among other things while the state can be lumbering and slow or individual organisations and citizens can be disconnected or snowed under. In that respect the bad actors have an advantage but it need not be an advantage which lasts very long.</p>
<p>With regard to AI and electronic campaigns such as mass emails or social media comments there&#8217;s always going old school and giving habeas corpus a new lease of life. In other words put down your clipboard and pen and stop gazing at that computer screen and pay attention to the person sitting in front of you. As bad actors go digital go analogue.</p>

				<p>If I was a politician, I wouldn&#8217;t have email or a web site.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d use my franking privileges to mail my constituents, and tell them to send me a postcard, and keep the postcards in a file.</p>

				<p>How much longer before someone tries to draft legal (e.g.: SCOTUS) decisions with GPT-3? Dial the ideological cursor, befuddle the reader, apply an adroit sleight of hand, sprinkle a couple of semantic slips and double negations, and voilà!</p>

				<p><i>And I managed to mess up my blog URL</i></p>
<p>IMO, a pretty useless facility, which on this blog and elsewhere is mostly used by s{p,c}ammers, who post pseudo-comments like &#8220;Nice blog you have here&#8221;, but insert the real payload as an URL advertising for Nigerian bitcoin-powered virility enhancers or whatever.</p>

				<p><i>There’s currently an organised and massive denial of service attack on the UK’s Freedom of Information law and propaganda exercise by pummelling state organisations with fishing expedition FOI’s with perjorative language which have interations with human rights organisations. </i></p>
<p>Do you have a source for that? And is it AI driven, or human generated?</p>
<p>I heard of such tactics in the US in the last few years, e.g., harassing climate researchers. A contagion of the same phenomenon?</p>
<p>Is this avalanche of requests anonymous and/or pseudonymous?</p>
<p>FOI is more abused by administrations, with exorbitant fee requests, excessive delays, willful misunderstanding, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>On the continent, authorities try to thwart online FOI portals with tactics such as alleging copyright protection (DE: &#8220;Zensurheberrecht&#8221;), insisting on a physical address for the requester (eg. DE). In Spain, government supplied FOI portals demand a national ID card (&#8220;DNI&#8221;) number, and won&#8217;t let you go past that point if you can&#8217;t supply a valid one, even though the law allows for &#8220;any person&#8221; to make a request. Frequent requesters can thus be identified and flagged, and the system is in practice unavailable to foreigners.</p>
<p>The future of FOI in post-Brexit Britain is already uncertain. What is the status of the EU&#8217;s Freedom of access to information directive (2003/4/EC)? It is an implementation of an international treaty, the Aarhus convention, and (was?) part of UK law as the Environmental Information Regulations 2004.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Information_Regulations_2004" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Information_Regulations_2004</a></p>
<p>This directive is much stronger than most national statutes, but applies only to environment-related information.</p>
<p>My most recent FOI UK request (~3y) was a failure. The requested document was provided, but with all parts not narrowly related to the specific query language were redacted out (that&#8217;s about 80%+ of black). There is no legal basis for this, and I could/should have pointed out ICO guidance explicitly prohibiting this practice, but I was disgusted at that point, and gave up. Sirs Arnold and Humphrey grin from their graves.</p>
<p>UK government departments must file annual reports with Parliament. Many of them are jokes, and of the level of a coloring book, with plenty of irrelevant details, but nary information about the actual operation and results of the administration.</p>

				<p>Maybe there&#8217;s a case where such outrage would be justified but net neutrality is clearly unconstitutional in the first place.</p>
<p>Second, why would the question of private property rights be open to interpretation or commenting &#8211; as if it was a fashion statement that depends or someone&#8217;s opinion this or that week?</p>
<p>Third, the Democrats control most of mainstream media and perform subtle spamming on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The bottom line is it doesn&#8217;t matter what the comments say and whether they are or aren&#8217;t fake.</p>

				<blockquote><p>
  making it possible to generate . . . comments at scale, drowning out the voices of real citizens in a tidal wave of fake ones.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We need to address <em>that</em> problem instead of framing this as a problem with &#8220;AI&#8221; (which, as I have noted before, this current crop of machine learning algorithms should <em>not</em> be conflated with).  This is very directly related to topics like electronic voting, because it is yet another way the voice of the people can be heard.  So whatever process validates public comments should work <em>regardless</em> of their content; it should even be effective for simple yes/no polls.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  These companies then stole people?s names and email addresses from old files and from hacked data dumps and attached them to 8.5 million public comments and half a million letters to members of Congress.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That is a serious amount of identity theft at a minimum, and quite possibly a massive human rights violation.  It goes so directly to subverting democracy that it might rise to the level of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason_laws_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow ugc">treason</a>.  Officers of these companies should be charged with capital crimes.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The danger . . . is that public commentary will be completely discredited.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In many corners of the Internet, it already is.  Your blog itself is an interesting case study, Bruce, because it still manages to curate mostly quality comments despite allowing mostly anonymous posting.  I wonder what mechanisms you use and could stand to improve upon in order to keep other forms of public commenting safe from manipulation at scale.</p>
<p>@Chris Dotson</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Trusted digital identities issued by the government would solve a lot of problems, although it would probably cause a few too.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, for starters, they should simply verify the identifying info they&#8217;re already getting!  I can&#8217;t go to a podunk web site and set up an account without my email address being checked, yet the federal/state government isn&#8217;t doing that basic of a challenge-response test for the submissions it receives?  Makes me wonder if there isn&#8217;t corruption at a deeper level that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>@Tatütata</p>
<blockquote><p>
  IMO, a pretty useless facility, which on this blog and elsewhere is mostly used by s{p,c}ammers
</p></blockquote>
<p>While that is true in general, I happen to use it to verify that my identity is linked to my comments here.  A copy of most &#8220;public commentary&#8221; I make is on my blog, and I can give a specific URL to verify that I&#8217;ve actually said what this blog&#8217;s comment section says I said.  That&#8217;s another solution to the problem being discussed, making fakes a pointless endeavor regardless of how sophisticated their generation may be.</p>

				<p>@Tatütata</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of cross fertilisation between UK and US far right. Whether it&#8217;s legal action, abuse of public office, abuse of media jobs; use of mass lobbying campaigns either direct with politicians or social media and of named or anonymous status; use of personal connections and in some cases celebrity status. Some of the material is outright lies and provably so for a long time but there is a propoganda and recruiting element too. They exploit complacency, imbalance of resources, and in some cases use the default camara shy secrecy of some state workers to gain ground by default.</p>
<p>UKn security services have publicly admitted they were slow on the far right threat and have also admitted that the far right have infiltrated state institutions. I personally use a broader definition than the usual cartoon figures. The far right threat isn&#8217;t just the usual cartoon figures but people with attitudes and points of view which can be politically exploited.</p>
<p>There is a government agency which I won&#8217;t name which made a decision which was very odd at best and gave special treatment to a certain shady far right organisation. People have already put their FOI&#8217;s in and there is talk of a judicial review rather than relying on firefighting with the usual after the event complaints.</p>
<p>The advice I received off a former civil servant about FOI&#8217;s is to be specific. I&#8217;ve personally made FOI&#8217;s and Subject Data Access Requests of Parliament itself and been punked by staff. This and everything surrounding it is in addition to previous actions I was advised would attract an ECJ case. It&#8217;s all very curious. The most useful information wasn&#8217;t what information they returned but what they did and didn&#8217;t do, and what they chose to ignore or not ignore. There are some whoppers in there. This is all logged. I have also logged publicly recorded events surrounding conduct of staff and members of the house which provide extra context, as well as samples of behaviour of members of the house in committee and individual MPs on various issues. I&#8217;ve also logged reports of the various complaints systems in place and how they have been used and abused. It&#8217;s all a bit of a mess but shows parliament up on a functional level as amateur hour and in breach of various laws and legal obligations as well as Convention rights. This awaits the attention of lawyers as and when I get around to securing one.</p>
<p>Some people might think I was a complete clown for not getting what I wanted done. They would likely be correct. Other people might say it was an effective social engineering attack for coming away with more of the kind of data about their skills and attitudes and behaviours they wouldn&#8217;t want to admit. They may be right about that too. They even exfiltrated it for me. How nice of them!</p>
<p>If you take a step back you can see how this all works in tandem. Multiple attacks are launched via multiple stooges on a continuous rolling basis abusing trust and loopholes (whether real or perceived) and attitudes to create newsworthy items and trigger compliance investigations and so on and so forth. It&#8217;s designed to weaken and wear down and influence.</p>
<p>The UK government is very shady both in its public agenda and how it goes about implementing change some of which is a policy tweak here or an oversight there, outright breaking of law or evading of law, hoping nobody will notice.</p>
<p>In addition to FOI&#8217;s being dodged blanket bans are unlawful as are rights in law which only exist in theory not practice. There is a higher expectation of performance when it comes to Convention rights.</p>

				<p>Strange how it is that some of the hacked toilet bowls were taking photos of people&#8217;s rumps during the &#8220;flush&#8221; (the motion sensors were integrated with some kind of camera systems).</p>
<p>Naturally, it was also a problem in terms of privacy as well as biometric privacy.  One way to cope is to put some kind of sticker over the camera and continue to use the manual flushing switch.  And yet that still doesn&#8217;t solve several other serious annoyances.</p>
<p>And of course, never in the history of living mammals have we needed cameras to poop or pee.</p>
<p>I just hope that the next time there is a black out or brown out, that they have some way to cope with that kind of Mario Bros. nonsense even though they might rest a heckuva lot easier without so much electricity so close to the water.</p>

				<p>Picking up on the AI component versus astroturfing and variants of same it really comes down to real people versus deepfakes. That is an issue but I think a  lot of law already exists to cover this as well as various verifications and investigation methods. A lot of loopholes aren&#8217;t really loopholes as such but more relying on poor administrative and poor decision skills and lack of policy or inadequate resources and various parts of the system not joining the dots.</p>
<p>The AI component can play a role in dodging quality control at the perimeter and scaling so systems which simply weigh the data can be skewed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s more difficult to dodge old school on the ground assessment by real people meeting real people, and academic studies, and surveys. It&#8217;s also difficult to dodge a track record. While an act first apologise later system can ruin lives and be expensive in reversing bad decisions forensics is also getting a little smarter plus the human rights aspect can introduce room to pause for thought.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bold thing to say but I suspect within a few years this whole problem area will be seen to be a flash in the pan. Once you see the con or know how the trick works it loses it power.</p>
<p>There is value in reputable people and institutions and methods. No it&#8217;s not always the ones with the highest status or the biggest size. Independents or self-help groups have legitimacy too. The erosion of this and the erosion of perceptions by bad actors very very nearly pulled it off but they didn&#8217;t pull it off. We know who they are. We know what they are up to. They have revealed their hand and are unmasked. Surely, this is their error? Expensive lawyers and secretive tax haven accounts and lurking behind fine print can only keep them from disgrace and ruin and out of jail for so long.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my theory!</p>
