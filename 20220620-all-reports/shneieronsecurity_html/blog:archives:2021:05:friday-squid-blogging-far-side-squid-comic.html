				<p>Your Friday post always makes me chuckle.  My first job, before working for Lynn McNulty in the &#8217;80s, was on 72&#8242; dragger, the &#8220;Atlantic Queen&#8221;.  In the summer, we fished squid, just off the beach.  We would get a heaping deck full and &#8216;pick&#8217; 50 lbs into what looked like heavy duty laundry baskets.  As the low-man on the crew totem pole, I would jump down into the hold and shovel ice into a waxed box and the mate would drop the fish baskets down to me.  The trick was to dump the lowering basket into the box in one descending motion, then stow the box in the hold.  Of course, the fearing squid would have ejected their ink by this time and the oozings from the basket would run down my up-reached arms. By the end of the day, my arms were completely caked black and salty.  Getting back late at night, I&#8217;d fall asleep standing in the shower, leaned up against the wall until the water ran cold.</p>
<p>Strangely, it was one of the most satisfying jobs I ever had.  We&#8217;d tie up to the dock and unload the catch, food for a couple thousand people, into a semi.  As the junior crew member, I only had one &#8220;lay&#8221;, or share of the catch, but at 18 it was more cash than I thought could be made.  Then we&#8217;d clomp up to the 2nd floor bar overlooking the docked fishing fleet, filthy, like everyone else in the bar, and drink and laugh.</p>

<p>It sounds like they&#8217;re drunk on rotgut liquor or high on legsl marijuana. It&#8217;s a bad hangover or something.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t want to be the one to tell them their careers are over &#8212; if that&#8217;s the CIA, certainly no worse than their counterparts in other countries.</p>
<p>If they can&#8217;t attend local AA or NA meetings or something like that, then we in the United States should not be sending diplomatic agents to socialize with unrepentant drunks and avowed drug addicts in foreign countries.</p>
<p>The CIA has had this problem before.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t there a $50,000 pill or something like that &#8220;as seen on TV&#8221; supposed to cure Hepatitis C?</p>

				<p>After reading this Bitcoin related story:<br />
h<em>t</em>t<em>p</em>s://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/12/elon-musk-tesla-bitcoin</p>
<p>I have decided to unMusk Mr. eLoan Musk.</p>
<p>He is not stupid, he&#8217;s just a put-on. He just wants your money by making you believe you are saving the planet by driving a Tesla because it doesn&#8217;t run on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Mining, and extracting/processing Lithium leaves an Eco-Apocalypse behind, far and wide around and within any area where it&#8217;s done.<br />
How many Tesla or Prius owners know about this?<br />
eLoan does know it but he can always turn it around in his favor.</p>

				<p>WHO reviewing Seychelles COVID-19 data after fully vaccinated people test positive:</p>
<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/reviewing-seychelles-covid-19-data-134637551.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://news.yahoo.com/reviewing-seychelles-covid-19-data-134637551.html</a></p>
<p>Oh good, the WHO is reviewing the data. What a relief.</p>
<p>In other news, the fox will watch the hen-house this afternoon.</p>
<p>A couple of points..</p>
<p>If you are surprised that fully vaccinated people are contracting SARS-CoV-2 then you&#8217;ve been grossly misinformed by the media, your government, or your friends. The pharmas have been very clear in their statements that their &#8220;vaccines&#8221; will not prevent you from contracting and spreading the virus. This is entirely expected.</p>
<p>The media and global governments are being very careful to not address the elephant in the room. The &#8220;leaky&#8221; vaccines will make things worse, and the Seychelles are an example of this. The vaccines are creating asymptomatic &#8220;super spreaders&#8221; and there is a risk that as the virus continues to spread and mutate it can become more deadly. research Marek&#8217;s disease for an example of this.</p>

&#8220;The “leaky” vaccines will make things worse, and the Seychelles are an example of this. The vaccines are creating asymptomatic “super spreaders”&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not really. Vaccination prevents illness and death and reduces the period and amount of virus spread, R0. So it reduces new infections. We see this in countries with high degrees of vaccination, e.g., Israel and UK.</p>
<p>But not dying or having to visit a hospital are in itself already good things.</p>
<p>Claiming vaccines must be perfect or they are worthless (or dangerous) is a straw man used often by the anti-vaxxer movement.</p>
<p>BTW, the Seychelles used Sinovac and AZ. And let in ample infected tourists.</p>

<p>Driving electrical has environmental problems. Driving on fossil fuels kills the environment.</p>
<p>It is a balance. What should we do? Drive electrical and clean up the mess, or drive fossil and have nothing to clean up anymore?</p>

So where does the electricity come from to run the eletric cars?</p>
<p>I comes from electrical generating plants, most of which are fossil fuel fired.</p>
<p>Just because the electric car does not have an attached exhaust pipe does not mean it does not have an exhaust pipe; that exhaust pipe is at the power plant, where fossil fuels are still being burned.</p>
<p>Consider how much MORE fossil fuels will need to be burned to increase the capacity of these plants, not to mention the cost of increasing the transmission capability to get the power to the charging stations.</p>

&#8220;So where does the electricity come from to run the eletric cars?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually, all from sustainable sources. Until then only partially from &#8220;green&#8221; energy. Thing can change, if we want to.</p>
<p>If there is anything COVID-19 showed, it is that the unthinkable can be made real in a year if we want to.</p>
<p>And before you start, putting solar panels in a small corner of a desert could easily supply the world with electricity. And every continent has enough deserts to generate all the energy needed.</p>

				<p>The vaccines is useful in mitigating the serious conditions that can result from contracting Covid-19.   This might result in someone who contracts the illness being asymptomatic.  So, like the New York Yankees, they might not know they have the illness, absent testing.</p>
<p>So now, these geniuses at the CDC has said we can take the masks off.  In my area, all mask mandates are gone, all signs are gone, and no one is wearing masks.  Remembering that the reason given for wearing masks in the first place was to prevent asymptomatic people from spreading the virus, asymptomatic spread now has a big green light.</p>
<p><em>So, the risks for the unvaccinated just went up</em>. The way people are looking at it is, this great pandemic of 2020 is something that happened in the past.</p>

				<blockquote><p>
  Eventually, all from sustainable sources. Until then only partially from “green” energy. Thing can change, if we want to.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh my dear god. Hope and change. Yes we can!!!</p>
<p>How delusional can one be?</p>
<p>Your stupidity and mental retardation is obviously not limited to the covid-19 vaccine shilling you always rant around here, no it goes much further that that.</p>
<p>You really have no clue about anything you are babbling about and unexpectedly it shows.</p>
<p>So called renewable energy will never ever fully replace fossil fuels without the help of fusion power which is nowhere to be found and decades away at best if at all.</p>
<p>Stop lying to people and telling them that all will be well when it will not only not be so, but it will get much, much worse for everyone not being part of the 0,1%.</p>
<p>In less than 4 years time the limits to growth will be reached and the shadows already cast are literally everywhere to see for those who are used to actually use their brains somewhat now and then, contrary to you, I know.</p>
<p>You are not fooling anyone here with your stupid gibberish and completely delusional, intentionally malicious deceptions, you repellent jackass.</p>
<p>Nothing will be well for most of the people and things will only worsen as resource shortages hit and supply lanes get constricted and prices start to explode. There will be nowhere to hide once the nuclear reactors aren&#8217;t cooled anymore because the economy has collapsed due to climate change induced food shortages.</p>
<p>You have really no clue what you are talking about, like absolutely none, but you like for others to be fed your insidious and malevolent, sadistic lies, you abhorrent imbecile.</p>
<p>It is physically impossible to replace fossil fuels by so called renewable energy sources while maintaining the same growth and energy basis that exists today.</p>
<p>The laws of nature are not open for anthropocentric BS. Once the limits of a given system are reached that&#8217;s it about it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If there is anything COVID-19 showed, it is that the unthinkable can be made real in a year if we want to.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Who is we? did you have any say or work in that matter besides for your petulant heinous vaccine shilling to get people killed, you revolting lamebrain?</p>
<p>You are not part of something bigger, just a small and dirty little shill, a shitty spot of dreck doing the bidding for the psychopaths in charge, you putrid cunt.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  And before you start, putting solar panels in a small corner of a desert could easily supply the world with electricity. And every continent has enough deserts to generate all the energy needed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Really? Tell me more about your fantastic plans!<br />
How many acres would you need? How much energy does it take to construct these solar panels? Ho long do they last? Is their output within a range where they could power their complete replacement as soon as their efficiency factor start dropping? What will happen at night when no sun is shining? Where would you save the excess energy surely having to be produced during the day to power all applications need electricity  at night?</p>
<p>How do you plan to recycle the solar panels? That does take a lot of energy. Do they also supply the power for the mining of the required rare earth elements necessary for their production?<br />
Can your power a steel mill with them 24/7/365 without interruptions?<br />
How do you want to deliver the energy generated over thousands of miles of landlines without enormous losses?<br />
What happens once a sand storm blows some dust one the panels? Does their output remain unchanged? Where do you want to get the precious resources to build so many panels from, panels which then have to be replaced every 20 years for the solar power plant to remain at full capacity?</p>
<p>Apparently you know more than the engineers tasked with the development, planning and construction of such projects. Why aren&#8217;t you already a billionaire if you know so much that allows you to spout out such ludicrous blatant lies with such a false sense of over-confidence, you nasty chimmer?</p>
<p>I can tell you why, because you are talking out of your dirty, sh-itstain filled, carbuncle infested ass again, you satanic, dimwitted dreckish imbecile, fu-ck your lies and fu-ck you, yes fu-ck everything about you, you fuc-ked up fuc-king fuc-ker, you are a good candidate for murder-rape and molestation and disfigurement of the genetic waste that remains.<br />
My desk lamp needs a new lamp shade anyway, at least I could use your skin then, you bloodsucking borrelia infested tick.</p>

				<p>About replacing fossil fuels by solar energy.</p>
<p>The sums are not that difficult. If you do them you find you can deliver total energy (replacing ALL sources of energy) for 1B people at a level higher than current consumption in the EU by planting an area in the Sahara less than twice the size Germany with solar panels. Electricity can be transported by high voltage DC power lines with little loss over the whole of Europe.</p>
<p>For instance, solar flux in tropical regions is around 300 Wm-2 averaged over a day. Take a net efficiency of 5%, losses in surface use and transportation included. The German per capita energy use is ~5.5kW. If we take a generous 7.5 kW as the norm, it would take 500 m^2 per capita to power a country like Germany. For 1B people we would need 500,000 km^2. The area of Germany is 357,114 km^2.</p>
<p>Easy to translate to North America.</p>
<p>That is all with current technologies.</p>
<p>Mind you, the investments would be astronomical and there would still be maintenance and political problems. But it can be done with the means available.</p>

				<p>@ AlanS,</p>
<p>With regards Riana Pfefferkorn&#8217;s article.</p>
<p>She says early on,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Cellebrite’s products are part of the industry of “mobile device forensics” tools. “The mobile forensics process aims to recover digital evidence or relevant data from a mobile device in a way that will preserve the evidence in a forensically sound condition,” <b>using accepted methods, so that it can later be presented in court.</b> &#8220;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>As I understand it Cellebrite&#8217;s product under discussion is well known for quite some time to not actually conform to a number of &#8220;accepted methods&#8221; for evidence gathering etc.</p>
<p>This is something Riana Pfefferkorn later mentions with,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Plus, unlike some cop taking screenshots, a logical data extraction preserves the recovered data “in its original state with forensically-sound integrity admissible in a court of law.” Why show that the data were extracted and preserved without altering anything? Because that’s what is necessary to satisfy the rules for admitting evidence in court. U.S. courts have rules in place to ensure that the evidence that is presented is reliable — you don’t want to convict or acquit somebody on the basis of, say, a file whose contents or metadata got corrupted. Cellebrite holds itself out as meeting the standards that U.S. courts require for digital forensics.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Thus technically the Cellebrite devices should not be used as an &#8220;evidence gathering device with chain of custody suitable for presentation as evidence in a criminal case&#8221; (as for civil cases, judges apparently will take any old hearsay these days&#8230;).</p>
<p>Even though this failure of Cellebrite&#8217;s devices has been known for some time (the same with similar devices from other entities) it&#8217;s very very rarely if ever been challanged in court previously&#8230;</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve noted in the past, one of the reasons this has not come up before is judges apparent dislike of &#8220;expert witnesses&#8221; contradicting each other. Because technically they are &#8220;Court Officers&#8221; and have been recogbised as such by the judge in each case. Thus such argumentative behaviour reflects badly on &#8220;the court&#8221; thus &#8220;the judge&#8221;. Also there is the &#8220;comprehension&#8221; issue, whilst logic might be a strong suit for judges basic STEM often appears to have allude their studies, and they do not take kindly to such issues being highlighted&#8230;</p>
<p>Unfortunately as Riana Pfefferkorn notes,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Between Cellebrite and the other vendors in the industry of mobile device forensics tools, there are over two thousand law enforcement agencies across the country that have such tools — including 49 of the 50 biggest cities in the U.S. Plus, ICE has contracts with Cellebrite worth tens of millions of dollars.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Thus we realy should ask why this state of affairs is still going on?</p>
<p>And why I have to disagree with,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;But a lot of vendors in this industry, the industry of selling surveillance technologies to governments, sell not only to <b>the U.S. and other countries that respect the rule of law</b>&#8220;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Because they are very clearly &#8220;avoiding&#8221; it. And I do not think it is just because judges are not to hot on basic STEM.</p>
<p>If you think about it such avoidence has political advantages, it enables many Law Officers and Prosecutors to &#8220;rack up convictions&#8221; that help them falsely look &#8220;Tough on crime&#8221; thus get re-elected or promoted which has a very clear financial advantage for them. Such &#8220;knowing behaviour&#8221; comes under various criminal statutes including those for fraud.</p>
<p>Thus they get away with it by &#8220;pretending&#8221; they do not understand or know about it, and they will steadfastly refuse to &#8220;understand it&#8221; which is a very certain indicator that they are more certainly guilty than those they are locking up or attempting to do so by their &#8220;faux ignorance&#8221;.</p>
<p>This sort of &#8220;fraudulant politics&#8221; is far from new, it&#8217;s been endemic for over a century. So much so that Upton Sinclair made a now very well known quote about it.</p>
<p>Which makes me curious as to why Riana Pfefferkorn avoided it, surely she must be more than aware of it.</p>
<p>In her musings on Moxie&#8217;s reason to go public the way he did, she did not even consider that his target was actually those practicing &#8220;fraudulant politics&#8221; in the judicial system&#8230; Personally I rather think they were the target as they are the ones that are actually going to suffer the most from having their &#8220;easy ride&#8221; taken away from them.</p>
<p>But Riana Pfefferkorn also misses another point Moxie was making when she says,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;In a recent legal webinar about mobile device forensics tools, the discussion touched upon Signal’s Cellebrite hack. One of the panelists pointed out that Cellebrite’s not the only game in town when it comes to these extraction tools. It’s a whole industry, it’s not just this one company, although Cellebrite is probably the best-known actor in that industry. Therefore, as the panelist pointed out, if you’re law enforcement, you can just perform the same extraction through a different program, and there won’t be a problem <b>because this flaw is unique to Cellebrite.</b>&#8220;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>But in the same way as the attack would not be unique to Signal, any app could do it, the problem is very definately not unique to Cellebrite&#8217;s products, they all have them one way or another and will have more as time goes on. We all know this at a fundemental level, in fact our host @Bruce has pointed out on a number of occasions that attacks only get better with time. We also know at a fundemental level that most products are riddled with bugs that are exploitable, it is after all why we have &#8220;Patch Tuesday&#8221; not just for one commercial grade software supplier but, as far as I can tell all commetcial grade software suppliers that make an attempt at updating their software.</p>
<p>Thus we know fundementally commercial grade software development is a &#8220;Red Queen&#8217;s Race&#8221;. That is as a commercial grade software developer/supplier, you are going to fail to keep your product secure, no matter how hard you try, no matter what tools you use, eventually some zero day is going to come your products way, it&#8217;s just a matter of probability thus time before it happens. The question then becomes,</p>
<p>&#8220;What the zero day lead time is on your patch?&#8221;</p>
<p>As we know from Microsoft some vulnerabilities can be in their third decade when they finally get a patch. So the question then becomes,</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you honestly say that nobody has exploited it in that time?&#8221;</p>
<p>To which the answer is &#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly of course you can not&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>So I can by simple deduction and high probability of correctness claim,</p>
<p>&#8220;The entire &#8216;Extraction and Processing Tool Industry&#8217; is vulnerable to this class of attack&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus no way can it be said by anyone with any domain knowledge that &#8220;this flaw is unique to Cellebrite&#8221;, none what so ever.</p>
<p>So why Riana Pfefferkorn did not make that ubundantly clear I&#8217;ve no idea.</p>
<p>What Moxie and Signal have done is start the shake up in the &#8220;fraudulant politics&#8221; of the justice system. And yes people will get hury in the process, but it also means in the longer term the justice system will have in one area improved.</p>
<p>But there is a second less obvious but more intriguing thing Moxie has done. In effect he has handed out a very clear signal that any app developer or data file originator can do this. Whilst Apple/Google might strip apps out of their &#8220;walled Gardens&#8221; they can not stop &#8220;data files&#8221; getting onto their systems. Thus they can not in any way stop carefully crafted files aimed at the &#8220;Extraction Tool and File Processing&#8221; industry. Further even if such a file is found on a phone by those working in the bottom end of the justice system, the best that can be shown is that the user got sent the file on such and such a date and time, along with some meta-data that could very very easily be made non attributable&#8230; The fact that the file will apparently behave normally on the phone because it&#8217;s payload is not aimed at the phone makes &#8220;plausable deniability&#8221; for the phone user that much easier&#8230;</p>
<p>With Signal on your phone, then the lack of meta-data Signal hold, and likewise the minimal meta-data the app keeps makes the attribution issue even harder.</p>
<p>The &#8220;File Extraction and Processing Tool&#8221; industry, as it aquires much of it&#8217;s software from places where others can get the source etc with no difficulty, will always be vulnerable to this issue, and I rather think that, that is the point Moxie was making&#8230; It&#8217;s a shame Riana Pfefferkorn kind of missed it.</p>
