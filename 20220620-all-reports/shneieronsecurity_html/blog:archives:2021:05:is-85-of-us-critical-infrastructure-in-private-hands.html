		<h2 class="entry">Is 85% of US Critical Infrastructure in Private Hands?</h2>
		<p>Most US critical infrastructure is run by private corporations. This has major security implications, because it&#8217;s putting a random power company in &#8212; say &#8212; Ohio &#8212; up against the Russian cybercommand, which isn&#8217;t a fair fight.</p>
<p>When this problem is discussed, people regularly quote the statistic that 85% of US critical infrastructure is in private hands. It&#8217;s a handy number, and matches our intuition. Still, I have never been able to find a factual basis, or anyone who knows where the number comes from. Paul Rosenzweig <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/it-really-85-percent">investigates</a>, and reaches the same conclusion.</p>
<p>So we don&#8217;t know the percentage, but I think we can safely say that it&#8217;s a lot.</p>

				<p>This estimation is incorrect &#8211; and in a different sense from yours.<br />
What is formally classified as &#8216;private hands&#8217; are not &#8216;private&#8217; if a bit deeper research is conducted &#8211; such as a Swiss doctoral thesis by Glattfelder (2013).</p>
<p>The author looked in ownership of 43000 non-small corporations from 116 countries, and found out that the graph structure reduced to a slightly over 1000 banking and financial corporations in a position of control of 60% of all corporations in the set, and that an even smaller number (100+) of major bankster financial corps controlled about 40% of the corporations. At the same time this core belonged to other core members, and was not controlled from outside by any strangers.</p>
<p>THIS IS WHAT WORLD POWER STRUCTURE IS, objectively measured through the corporate network ownership structure &#8211; and this bankster domination easily explaines why mega-corporations act in concert (rather than arbitrarily warring) when strategic initiatives are launched by the &#8216;Deep State&#8217;.</p>
<p>One example from the IT world was the &#8216;total information awareness&#8217;, then flourishing as cloud storage, cloud computing, newer OS versions which no longer belong to individual purchasers, but having a controlling mind of their own located somewhere outside on the corporate Net etc, etc, etc</p>
<p>CRITICAL US STRUCTURE may belong to &#8216;private&#8217; corporations &#8211; but it has never been truly private, as corporate control networks ensure their military-style compliance even if there is no federal law compelling them to do so, they will act &#8216;voluntarily&#8217; as ordered.</p>
<p>And then A QUESTION ARISES: why mass media and political activists try to conseal this reality and push alarmist points of view to the exclusion of reality-based evaluations?</p>

				<p>I think we need to start by defining Critical Infrastructure.  You can&#8217;t measure what you cannot define. There is probably valid arguments about what to include, but here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airports and safety critical equipment (de-icing, fire and rescue, ground control radar)</li>
<li>Air Traffic Control Infrastructure (secondary radar, ATC centers)</li>
<li>Cloud infrastructure: Cloud data centers for enterprise services (AWS, Azure) and consumer services (Facebook)</li>
<li>Communications Infrastructure &#8211; Mobile Networks (2G to 5G)</li>
<li>Communications Infrastructure &#8211; Fixed networks (PSTN, ADSL etc)</li>
<li>Financial services: retail payment networks (Mastercard, Visa)</li>
<li>Food storage and distribution: warehousing, cool-chain, </li>
<li>Fuel: Refining, transport and distribution pipeline(s), ports/terminals, local gas stations</li>
<li>Internet infrastructure: backbone, exchange and peering-points, submarine cable</li>
<li>Navigation: Global Navigaiton Satellite System (eg GPS, Galileo, GLONASS)</li>
<li>Pharmaceutical: distribution and storage for the WHO essential medicines list (about 1000 items)</li>
<li>Ports: container ports and cranes, bulk ports, fuel/LNG terminals</li>
<li>Power: electricity generation, electricity distribution, electricity network control (signalling)</li>
<li>Power: gas production and distribution</li>
<li>Rail: rail signalling, permanent way, marshalling yards, passenger stations, level crossings</li>
<li>Road: Long distance road network (US Interstate, German Autobahn), road signalling, bridges</li>
<li>Time: distribution of accurate time signal(s)</li>
<li>Water infrastructure: reservoirs, distribution pipes, sewage and drainage, water treatment plants, standpipes</li>
</ul>
<p>Put the list like that and 85% in private hands looks like an underestimate &#8230; off the top of my head in the US ATC, GPS and time are the only ones in the public ownership.</p>
<p>Interesting question do we need global agreement on the integrity of these systems .. note the number of places above saying &#8220;signalling&#8221; ..</p>

				<p>Ha! Losers! In the UK it&#8217;s closer to 100%. All the utilities are in private hands, mostly foreign &#8211; many foreign government owned (EDF etc.) including nuclear plants. Communications, all private. Almost all public transport is private, only the roads seem to be in public hands, but all the management and maintenance seems to be outsourced anyway. All waste collection, recycling and disposal.</p>
<p>About the only thing that isn&#8217;t is the military. No, wait, yes it is &#8211; at least large chunks of it are.</p>

				<p>1)don&#8217;t attack medic&#8217;s, same as war time.<br />
2)power electrical is off limits.<br />
3)can attack offenses institutions, like UAVs<br />
4)Transport based on desil is out.<br />
5)Facebook open game<br />
6)manufacturing is ? Can add to escalation.<br />
7)food supply ,all of it is off limits.<br />
8)2nd stage espionage, is gaver Intel ,OK but needs mointior by home country.</p>

				<p>I don’t think public hands would be any safer against Russian hackers. There are lots of public school districts which have fallen victim to ordinary malware extortionists.</p>
<p>I think two things could help here. One is decentralization. Whether infrastructure is held publicly by many local jurisdictions or privately by many companies, the U.S. is better off if hacking one location doesn’t take down the entire country. The second thing is international norms. If Russia cares enough, it will get through any cyber defense any infrastructure manager creates. The diplomatic fallout has to be high enough to not be worth whatever benefit they get.</p>
<p>Bruce has already written about how bad the U.S. has been on punishing state hacking, presumably because the U.S. wants to keep hacking as well. I don’t think this stance is good for the domestic security of the U.S. It certainly harms other countries which find themselves in an inconvenient relationship with some superpower or another.</p>

				<p>It doesn&#8217;t bother me that so much critical infrastructure is in private hands.<br />
Does it really bother <em>you</em>?  I think it&#8217;s inevitable that much critical infrastructure is going to be in private hands, and it doesn&#8217;t matter deeply whether it is 10 percent or 85 percent.  Anyway, the government doesn&#8217;t take much better care of the critical infrastructure that is in its own hands unless it is directly military or perhaps diplomatic.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it really standards and requirements that we need, backed up properly resourced oversight.  Back when I worked at Sun Microsystems, the NSA took an interest in any uses we made of encryption, and I had a nice conversation with someone from the NSA about a very minor bit of cryptography that was in a product I had responsibility for.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, I&#8217;m from the NSA, and we need some information about your handling of certain infrastructure.  Yes, that&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s all part of national security.&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;Most US critical infrastructure is run by private corporations. This has major security implications&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230; that&#8217;s a subjective generalization with heavy political ideological bias.</p>
<p>It begs the question:  how much &#8216;critical infrastructure&#8217; should be in private versus government control ?</p>
<p>U.S is nominally a free society with a free economy based fundamentally upon private property.<br />
Thus, it&#8217;s very logical to expect that 95%+ of any infrastructure should be firmly in private hands.</p>
<p>Also, the critical, unstated, and highly subjective assumption here is that the government is much much better at protecting critical infrastructure than private corporations and citizens.<br />
Yet, the Federal government itself has been unable to protect its own systems &#8212; there have been huge penetrations/hacks of critical Federal systems recently.</p>
<p>And note that when the government wants something done technically it usually hires private corporations/businesses to do it, or at least sell it the necessary items.</p>

				</p>

				<p>We learned some interesting lessons about critical infrastructure over the last 50 years.  What is less clear is how widely (or well) these have been understood.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuel supplies for power stations to generate electricity.  We learned that in the UK during the industrial disputes of the &#8220;three-day week&#8221; in the 1970s.  And had to re-learn it 27 years later, in 2000, during the fuel-tanker drivers strikes.</li>
<li>Fuel supply pipelines.  We have know these are critical since the 2005 fire at the Buncefield oil storage facility, which affected the fuel supply to Heathrow airport. 16 years later Colonial was hit by a cyberattack.</li>
<li>During the early months of Covid-19, during lockdown, supermarkets in the UK ran out of flour for baking and never resupplied. There was never a shortage of flour: bread never ran short.  It was the supply of small paper bags for retail distribution that failed as the supplier shut down &#8230;</li>
<li>We are seeing occasional, so-far small-scale, disruption of the GPS signal. The hope is that it is low-level criminal activity (disrupting tachographs to record driving hours).  As a state-level attack it would be very disruptive.</li>
<li>Data about the supply chain .. NotPetya demonstrated that without accurate meta-data, your entire supply chain for imports is broken.  You cannot open all 18000 containers on a triple-E container ship when it docks to check them.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the proposed UK Telecom Security Bill, the Code of Practice is a reasonable attempt to articulate good practice for telecom network security. Other industries, we don&#8217;t have anything.</p>

				<p>@Sandman</p>
<p>I think that Bruce&#8217;s point is that being government controlled gives the entity options (and responsibilities) that may not be available to a corporation.</p>
<p>For example -&gt; the recent pipeline hack. If the pipeline had been government controlled, they wouldn&#8217;t have shut down the pipeline, and might not have paid the ransom. A company is obligated to act in a way that maximizes their own profits, so they had to shut everything down the moment billing stopped working. A government entity could weigh the lost revenue against damage done elsewhere (fuel shortages, refinery shutdowns, etc.)</p>
<p>Also, I don&#8217;t think it is fair to compare a school district against a piece of critical infrastructure. No one in the federal government cares if a school district has issues, but they absolutely care about national infrastructure, and could make plenty of resources available to help them.</p>

				<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter who owns the companies, what we need is a more secure internet protocol. The Colonial Pipeline hack should wake up some of bean-counters to the fact that they should be looking at improving their security.</p>

				<p>To elaborate on @Sandman, putting any local or state (and probably federal) government agency or department up against most hackers isn’t a fair fight-the hackers would win more often than not.  I don’t have hard and fast statistics to back this up, but just reading through news articles over the last few years (yes, I know that if someplace <b>isn’t</b> hacked, it isn’t newsworthy), there doesn’t seem to be effective safeguards in government, in addition to private companies.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />

				<p>@ koby,</p>
<blockquote><p>that’s a subjective generalization with heavy political ideological bias.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just wrong.</p>
<p>Ir has nothing to do with politics but the very real issues of &#8220;freemarket behaviour&#8221;.</p>
<p>The&#8221;Free market&#8221; through the idiocy of investors and company officers almost always enters a downward spiral of stupidity.</p>
<p>Where this has not happened can almost always be easily shown to be the quality and type of regulation.</p>
<p>Interrstingly when &#8220;regulation&#8221; gets &#8220;captured&#8221; or &#8220;weakened&#8221; by investors and or company officers through the likes of legaslitive &#8220;de-regulation&#8221; or a swotgh to &#8220;self regulation&#8221; it&#8217;s not very long befor the downward spiral sets in and people start getting hurt, maimed and killed or worse.</p>
<p>Contrary to the mantras MBA&#8217;s in the US get taught by rote, regulation almost always is benificial to the market as it provides increased resiliance thus stability and can easily ride out short term issues.</p>
<p>I would have thought that the &#8220;Supplie Line Issues&#8221; during COVID that has killed so many jobs etc would have been a wake up call, to get beyond the stupid party political posturing and name calling, but apparently not.</p>
<p>Makes me wonder if the US citizens are going to wake up to the fact of the &#8220;US way of life&#8221; is so badly harming them, before it eventually and seemingly inevitably kills them at an earlier age than the First World average. Go look and you will find not just Second World nations, but some Third World nations with better life expectancy than quite a large part of the US&#8230; And don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m picking on the US, have a look at the UK figures&#8230; Life exorctancy in West London suburbs is around 81year, go twrnty miles over to East London and it&#8217;s down to 52years&#8230;</p>
<p>Something for people to think about.</p>

				<p>@Peter,</p>
<p>Governments have the option to add additional regulations for critical infrastructure, even when it is in private ownership.</p>
<p>In the USA telcos already have to provide 911 service, plus lawful intercept (wiretap on presentation of a warrant).  In the UK this is being extended so that telecom operators will be required to implement best-practices for security.  e.g security of access to sensitive (administrative) functions will require MFA. Real-time control plane information will not be allowed to leave the UK.</p>
<p>What is required is political willingness to require private firms to implement additional security around critical infrastructure.  If you suggested this today in Ireland, which has seen its health service and hospitals attacked by ransomware over the weekend, you would get the required political support.</p>

<p>nope, US governments ain&#8217;t constitutionally free to just seize or control (&#8220;regulate&#8221;) private property as they please, though they frequently do so illegally. that democracy rule of law stuff is so annoying to political rulers.</p>

				<p>@All</p>
<p>&#8220;regulation&#8221; is most commonly presented as a &#8220;detrimental requirement&#8221; for business to provide or perform.  A form of punishment for the over exuberant application of capitalist ideas. A method to restrict or impede the full impact of capitalist economics.</p>
<p>&#8220;regulation&#8221; is also a perfect barrier to competition. Having baseline requirements that can only be met by a particular level of corporate funding, provides a safety backstop against other companies that might provide the same services.</p>
<p>On one side, it is protection for consumers against corporate harm, on the other side it prevents open competition between businesses.</p>
<p>Similar aspects follow down to local levels where permits, building codes, zoning and ordinances are promoted as Public Good but in reality are either competition restriction or a form of local funding from fees that transfer directly to those authorities.</p>
<p>A good question to ask is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the requirement is to improve economic value and to open competition, can you provide that service as defined tomorrow without massive infusion of capital?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the answer is NO, then that item is not as it is represented.</p>
<p>Big fish, little fish, minnows and whales. NIMBY/NAMBI</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>NIMBY, an acronym for the phrase &#8220;not in my back yard&#8221;<br />
NAMBI, an acronym for the phrase &#8220;not against my business or industry&#8221;</p>
<p>A Local Ordinance/Zoning tl;dr</p>
<ul>
<li>the difference between 2 buildings is defined by whether it has a &#8220;kitchen or ability to heat food&#8221; (oven, microwave, stove, cook top, electric skillet, rice cooker, toaster).</li>
</ul>
<p>The ordinance specifies &#8220;kitchen&#8221;; it does not specify if hay-boxes or high tech versions of hay boxes also constitute a kitchen.  The ability to boil water via an electric tea kettle may or may not qualify the building as having a kitchen.</p>
<p>You pay your application fee and see what pops out the other end.</p>

				<p>@IMg,</p>
<p>&#8220;nope, US governments ain’t constitutionally free to just seize or control (“regulate”) private property&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree, and so does the US Government, plus the Australian, Canadian, French, German, UK governments and European Commission.</p>
<p>May I draw your attention to 47 USC 1001-1010, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) from 1994, which does exactly this in regard of telecommunications networks. There was a lot of industry opposition at the time, mostly to do with the cost of implementation. In the end everyone agreed and the law was passed. Courts have not overturned it.</p>
<p>See also the Modification of Final Judgement (1982).</p>
<p>The short version is governments can regulate, when regulation is important enough to the public interest.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Critical infrastructure&#8221;</p>
<p>Critical to who? I mean, if we&#8217;re saying &#8220;unqualified critical&#8221;, then it MUST not fail, right? I&#8217;d say the same if it was &#8220;critical&#8221; for a large part of the population.</p>
<p>Private corporations have their own motivations and logic, which doesn&#8217;t include prioritising continuity and reliability in their systems, even if they acknowledge that those systems are critical.</p>
<p>In the UK in the 80s, we privatised a whole bunch of government services that were natural monopolies (and IMO critical): gas and electricity supply springs to mind. Artificial markets were set up, to create the appearance of competition. The result is the opposite of transparency: there are scores of providers, all with different tariffs that make price-comparison hard. There are numerous websites here that try to pierce the fog (for a commission). There is a regulatory department, within government, to regulate this artificial market. Market participants are regularly fined.</p>
