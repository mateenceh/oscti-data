		<h2 class="entry">Ransomware Shuts Down US Pipeline</h2>
		<p>This is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/08/us/politics/cyberattack-colonial-pipeline.html">major</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/business/energy-environment/colonial-pipeline-shutdown-gasoline.html">story</a>: a probably Russian cybercrime group called DarkSide shut down the Colonial Pipeline in a ransomware attack. The pipeline supplies much of the East Coast. This is the new and improved ransomware attack: the hackers <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/colonial-pipeline-hackers-stole-data-on-thursday-ahead-of-shutdown-bloomberg-1030405894">stole</a> nearly 100 gig of data, and are threatening to publish it. The White House has declared a <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/552564-white-house-declares-state-of-emergency-over-cyberattack-that-shut">state of emergency</a> and has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-10/white-house-creates-task-force-to-deal-with-pipeline-breach">created a task force</a> to deal with the problem, but it&#8217;s unclear what they can do. This is bad; our supply chains are so tightly coupled that this kind of thing can have disproportionate effects.</p>

				<p>What&#8217;s in the articles but not in Bruce&#8217;s summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ransomware both exfiltrated the data and encrypted it. The threat of public release of the data is in addition to the usual ransomware demand to pay up to get the decryption key.</li>
<li>It doesn&#8217;t appear that the actual operations computers were attacked. They closed the pipeline &#8220;as a precautionary measure&#8221;.  This suggests that Kurt Seifried&#8217;s link may be correct &#8212; they can operate the pipeline, but the billing systems are down.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the above is correct, it&#8217;s not exactly a national emergency.  It&#8217;s a financial crisis for the company, sure, but it sounds like they could resume pumping the oil and eat the financial losses if they so chose.</p>
<p>I still fail to understand why ransomware attacks are catastrophic. Seems like at worst it should be a case of, &#8220;Well that sucks, we&#8217;re going to lose a couple days while we restore from backup.&#8221;</p>

				<p>@Chellovek In the case of government ransomware of which there&#8217;s been multiple incidents in Texas, like the state supremes, it IS a big deal. If you can&#8217;t get legal case histories, or in the case of my county&#8217;s jail, inmate old records, it DOES screw stuff up.</p>

<p>Same type of faux apology we saw here last week.  Which, as I expected, was just that, as we have seen on latest squid.</p>
<p>RU is desparate to drive up oil prices.</p>

				<p>How did we get here?  When did it become obvious to everyone that much worse versions of this were coming down the (ahem) pipe?  2000 has to be a conservative guess: I bet it&#8217;s really the 1980s.  And what was done to prevent it?  Was anything done at all?  How long before someone takes all of AWS away or kills all the banks (who probably all are using tools which have privileged access and automatically download vendor updates from a single vendor with the resultant obvious catastrophe lurking) or something equally apocalyptic?</p>

<p>In case you missed it in the noise</p>

<p>Speaking of Just-in-Time, Supply Chains, and Texas…</p>
<p><a href="https://zetter.substack.com/p/biden-declares-state-of-emergency" rel="nofollow ugc">https://zetter.substack.com/p/biden-declares-state-of-emergency</a></p>
<p>A source who works for a large midstream oil company that feeds fuel into Colonial’s pipeline told Zero Day that the control systems for his company’s tank farms connect directly to control systems at Colonial Pipeline and that as soon as they learned about the ransomware incident on Saturday, they disconnected those systems to prevent the ransomware from traveling to their systems from Colonial’s networks.</p>
<p>He told Zero Day that his company has had to scramble to figure out what to do with the oil and fuel they have sitting in tanks and that they have received no word from Colonial about when the pipeline will be back online.</p>
<p>“We had a big batch scheduled today [to go to Colonial],” he told Zero Day. Instead they have to figure out other storage options for the fuel or reduce capacity in the refineries feeding the tanks. They also have to keep the material in the tanks moving with mixers or it will “stratify and affect product quality,” he said.</p>
<p>His company was told that Colonial’s main pipelines would “not be fixed in 1-2 days, but won’t take six weeks.” He’s not sure why Colonial would provide such a wide-ranging time period but said it’s “very concerning for our interests.”</p>
<p>“We gotta find storage for refineries [and we] might run out [of storage] it takes too long. Then refineries [will have to] cut back. Problem escalates,” he said.</p>

Ticketing system down, apparently they can only bill costumers manually&#8230; so pipeline got shut down&#8230;</p>
<p>Looks like it&#8217;s the same company (same pipeline?) responsible for this <a href="https://weather.com/news/news/2021-03-08-north-carolina-gasoline-spill-colonial-pipeline-oehler-nature-preserve" rel="nofollow ugc">massive spill</a></p>

<p>The odds are strong that FERC, CISA, NSA, FBI, and IRS are &#8216;ON THIS&#8217;, like an immune system responding to a vaccine.  (AKA, FOS)</p>
<p>Darkside went too far over their skis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Segments of our pipeline are being brought back online in a stepwise fashion, in compliance with relevant federal regulations and in close consultation with the Department of Energy, which is leading and coordinating the Federal Government’s response,” the company said in a statement.</p>

				<p>Proxy servers should be registered like machine guns. Anyone caught running a proxy server would have 10 years and $50k fine added to their sentence.</p>
<p>Next I would regulate bandwidth into/out of countries declared to be combatants. To the point of shutting them down, if necessary.</p>
<p>I would include satellite Internet systems in this list.</p>
<p>The days of allowing unrestricted Internet access are over.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would make it a federal crime to hook up national infrastructure to the Internet. All such entities should be on a military network, using encryption hardware issued by the NSA.</p>

<p>I agree with your ideas but I would go a step further.  The tech industry is the only sector in the critical infrastructure that isn’t legally required to “KYC” their customers &#8211; validate identify before doing business.</p>
<p>To FB’s credit they even validate their US members.</p>
<p>The MSFT and SolarWinds breaches were executed on public cloud infrastructure in the USA.  Like 9/11 our lackadaisical attitude toward securing our infrastructure is enabling it to be used against us.</p>
<p>Money laundering laws don’t only apply to financial services, they are relevant to all financial transactions.  I find it incredulous that I cannot get electricity to my home without giving my social security number, but someone can rent AWS services with a gift card.</p>
<p>For those that hate regulations &#8211; laws are a result of business making stupid choices and not exercising common sense.</p>

				<p>Ransomware meets the real world (scary stuff)<br />
But lets be honest, this is the holy grail of ransonware because it&#8217;s not just about data you forgot to backup.<br />
You&#8217;d think that everyone would be so scared that they&#8217;d avoid unnecessarily connecting their real time control, or even their systems / billing control to anything even remotely Internet accessible but you&#8217;d be wrong.<br />
These days there are all manner of systems connected directly to the internet that are accidents just waiting to happen, or Ransomware opportunities depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>Trouble is that these internet connections seem so logical when you are wanting to monitor large machines from places other then the belly of the large machine. Someone in the service department proves that they can work remotely if they just add a WiFi connection to a &#8230;. and they&#8217;re right they&#8217;ve made their job easier but in the process is they also made it easier for anyone to attack the system and potentially wreak havoc.<br />
Frankly I&#8217;m surprised that we haven&#8217;t seen more of these attacks, I&#8217;m guessing part of the reason is that there&#8217;s still so much lower hanging fruit out there that nobody has to work to hard to make a living in the Ransomware business.</p>

				<p>@ Bruce, Etienne, Fed.up, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>This is bad; our supply chains are so tightly coupled that this kind of thing can have disproportionate effects.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is the logical consequence of not regulating a market.</p>
<p>Basically due to short-termist thinking the US and other Nations that have favoured neo-con thinking over the past third to half century or in some cases longer, have alowed those supposadly in charge to compleatly &#8220;hollow out the infrastructure&#8221; with near zero maintainence and a compleate disregard for security and safety.</p>
<p>@ Etienne, Fed.up, ALL,</p>
<p>The &#8220;ban the technology&#8221; solution will not in any way fix the problem, history has taught us that over and over again with more conventional crime. All that will happen is that those involved will just evolve a different stratagem for communications, carrying out their activities and the transfer of finance etc etc.</p>
<p>Oh and as always legislators will be stupid and come out with legislation so broad in scope that they can make you guilty without you having actually done anything (see UK RIPA as an example with similar in Australia, as well as US legislation).</p>
<p>As I keep saying,</p>
<p>1, Technology is agnostic to use.<br />
2, The good or bad of technology use is an entirely human &#8220;Point Of View&#8221;(POW).<br />
3, The use of technology is entirely dictated by a &#8220;Directing Mind&#8221;.</p>
<p>Failing to understand any one of these three points has led almost invariably to bad or impossible legislation or regulation, that does not stop the intended problem in any way, the Directing mind simply out evolves it.</p>
<p>But what such bad legislation or regulation does create is hundreds if not thousands of other problems with the result that all such legislation and regulation does more harm to society than the original problem did, by a very long way.</p>
<p>If you want to actually stop these problems then controlling technology is going to fail, no ifs, no buts, no maybees, it fails every time. Historically like all religions and political systems before it the Roman Catholic Church tried it over and over and each time it failed. Likewise arms control and even Weapons of Mass Destruction it all fails, as will any attempt to stop the use of secure communications, or other technology.</p>
<p>The solution is not controling technology but the &#8220;Directing Minds&#8221;, that is those who actually made the problem in the first place, and legislate / regulate against them. But as they are the ones that make political donations and employ lobbyists to buy the direction of legislation, thus stop their dangerous behaviours from environmental polution, dangerous work place practices, and upwards being made illegal, you are first going to have to stop those backhanders and other inducements.</p>
<p>But &#8220;Being tough on technology&#8221; will work even less well than &#8220;Being tough on crime&#8221; which has &#8220;failed, failed again, and continues to fail, and will always fail&#8221;. Just like most other stupid knee jerk political mantra it&#8217;s designed to fail &#8220;profitably&#8221; for &#8220;the chosen few&#8221;. It almost always works because people who do not think the problem through fall for every time, thus those responsible walk away with even more &#8220;prevention&#8221; tax dollars in another endless &#8220;War on XXX&#8221;. As for those that created the problem in the first place, they will probably get &#8220;bailed-out&#8221; by tax dollars as well, either directly via regulation to clean up the mess they have created or when disaster strikes they are alowed to get away with it&#8230;</p>

<p>That is what you get in a police state, e.g., the USA (&amp;UK?).</p>
<p>But there is already cryptocurrency regulation underway.</p>
<p>It is pretty simple, money has to enter and leave the blockchain. Every Bitcoin can be traced back to it&#8217;s origin. Any cryptocurrency value which did not come from a KYC money account is blacklisted and cannot be exchanged for fiat currency anymore. Which means that Bitcoin will be split into whitelisted coins traceable to vetted bank accounts and unlisted coins, that no legal businesses will touch.</p>
<p>There will be black market coins, but these will have great difficulties getting back to cash and regular bank accounts.</p>
<p>Will it be perfect, no. But it only has to be less convenient than cash.</p>
<p>PS: Think &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221;, where Walter White sat on a cubic meter of dollar bills. The only thing he could think of was to bury it.</p>

<p>Not quite. This is like the Texas Freeze and Hurricane Katrina, the periodical fires in California, or the Western U.S. energy crisis of 2000 and 2001. In all these cases, important infrastructure and utility services were either not maintained to standards or not covered legally to ensure function.</p>
<p>Other areas are, e.g., broadband internet, law enforcement, and basic health care, to name a few orthogonal social and economic needs, which do not serve large sections of the population.</p>
<p>The point being that the US political and legal systems are unable to enforce minimum infrastructure and utility services. Any disruption by weather outliers or other outside interference drives the system to collapse.</p>

				<p>@ Winter,</p>
<blockquote><p>Any cryptocurrency value which did not come from a KYC money account is blacklisted and cannot be exchanged for fiat currency anymore.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not true, unfortunately, it&#8217;s premised on the notion that all banks will behave to a set of rules put in place by an entity they have no legal or regulatory relationship with. Especially when the banks know that the entity concerned will not play by it&#8217;s own rules.</p>
<p>You have to remember the biggest crooks in &#8220;money laundering&#8221; are &#8220;Sovereign Treasuries&#8221; and their nominated banks.</p>
<p>Thus the US will set up via the Federal Reserve a bitcoin &#8220;black list&#8221; as they see fit. But the US Government will move bitcoin from that blacklist for various reasons (effectively asset seizure legislation and the like). Other countries will do the same thus you will end up with &#8220;flavours of bitcoin&#8221;, just as we have &#8220;national fiat currencies&#8221;.</p>
<p>So when you consider China mines by far the majority of bitcoin and they also manufacture for or supply raw materials to so many other nations&#8230; that their whitlist will probably become the international standard if Bitcoin gets taken seriously.</p>
<p>But also consider what the US thinks it could do with such &#8220;blacklist power&#8221;. In theory it could see all the Bitcoins held by a national or corporate or provate entity and at the stroke of a keyboard make all their Bitcoins worthless&#8230; Do you realy think other Nations would ceed such power to the US? Lets just say it&#8217;s unlikely they would more likely make the holding or use of Bitcoin illegal, not just in their jurisdiction but take a leaf out of the US legislators loony two tunes mentality and make it clear their legislation applies &#8220;without jurisdictional limits&#8221; and back it up with the threat of &#8220;Guard Labour&#8221; force, at which point Bitcoin investors might start suffering from the crippling effects of &#8220;long gun fever&#8221;.</p>
<p>Various Governments have tried to put in place &#8220;Know Your Customer&#8221;(KYC) for many many decades, but ever since the breaking of the Bretton-Woods Gold pricing by bonds it became clear that such control not only can not work, it&#8217;s actually undesirable from the neo-con economic perspective.</p>
<p>Back when Tony Blair was PM in the UK, he tried pushing KYC onto banks, and banks threw it straight back again by saying they wanted around 430GBP per new account from the UK Government to meet the proposed UK legislative requirment. So the legislation got watered down.</p>
<p>It did not take identity fraudsters very long to realise how easy it was to get around the rules. In essence all they did was divert mail and reregister one or two basic utilities to their pseudonym having first got an identity document in that pseudonym.</p>
<p>For those a little further up the criminal tree stealing existing but quiesent bank accounts via insiders at call centers &#8220;outsourced in other countries&#8221; was the way to go.</p>
<p>Another technique is to buy up a limited company or similar and use their banking facilities to leverage other banking facilities.</p>
<p>Whilst seting up a limited company from scratch is not that difficult to do, you can purchase them &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; some used to come with basic &#8220;banking facilities&#8221;.</p>
<p>But the current prefered way to do things for many is the &#8220;Limited Liability Partnership&#8221;(LLP).</p>
<p>There are way to many rules, and thus there are edge and corner cases if not loop holes you can fairly easily exploit if you know what you are doing.</p>
<p>Look up Estonian &#8220;e-Passport&#8221; rules if you want a real eye opener. I was considering going down that route to have freedom of movment in Europe after Brexit, but decided in the end there was another way to achieve the same thing if I ever needed it.</p>
<p>[1] Identity documents are funny things, supposadly they are all tracable back to a &#8220;birth certificate&#8221; which is not exactly difficult to get hold of a copy. For obvious reasons birth certificates have no real recognisable bio-metric attached after all rumour has it we all look like &#8220;Winston Churchill&#8221; when we are born. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why Stella Rimington who was head of MI5 upset quite a few politicians and the lobbyists that thought they were going to make billions out of a National ID system, when she said no ID document could ever prove &#8220;who you actually are&#8221; only &#8220;The name it says you are&#8221;. Israel for instance, is known to encorage those who emmigrate there, not to revoke their previous national ID, but to &#8220;donate&#8221; their other nation ID documents to the Israeli Government&#8230; But if you know what you are doing and you plan ahead it&#8217;s actually not difficult to get a passport in a different name, one way is to get married and change your name, get new accounts in the married name and at some point get divorced having carried on using your old accounts throughout. But there is a fun side to ID documents, what are they? Well just about any &#8220;Government Agency&#8221; issued document will do. A friend who became bankrupt through no fault of their own when they became &#8220;discharged&#8221; used the UK Court issued paperwork which has no biometric information to open a new bank account. Apparently the young lady in the bank was surprised and went and saw the manager who OK&#8217;d it then and there, she just photocopied it and put it in the file&#8230; An interesting point is if you get arrested for some criminal act, if you have no ID and the police can not show you are not who you claim to be, then that is the name you get convicted under. Thus getting a new ID as a &#8220;Person legal or natural&#8221; is not as hard as it&#8217;s made out to be, then getting all the trappings of being a &#8220;person&#8221; such as driving licence, bank accounts, national security/tax ID, job then follow on. So KYC is a myth and for various reasons always will be in the foreseeable future, to exploit it you just have to know how the rules work, then work them to your advantage.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m sure they have backup and failover systems, I&#8217;m also sure they never tested them.  Because what if you run a test and the failover fails and then you can&#8217;t switch it back?  That, at least, was the excuse a (former) contractor for a USG IC system had for not testing it&#8230;</p>
<p>Former, because one day the power to the Big Server Room failed.</p>
<p>The $15 relay that was supposed to drop and cause the big diesel generators to start didn&#8217;t drop.</p>
<p>The Cisco switch that was supposed to tell the backup site to pick up had never been tested, and was misconfigured.</p>
<p>And a system that was used by the bureau, worldwide, went down without warning.  Oops. And we never did determine if any data was actually lost in transit.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, Dogecoin, other cryptocurrencies, sure, regulate them out of business. But now we are left with the basic building blocks of <strong>bad crypto</strong> like AES and SHA-256/512 whatever, which are no longer adequately secure for &#8220;essential&#8221; everyday use.</p>
<p>Remember the whole DES saga with weak keys, and the short work of cracking even the 56-bit good keys and the 3-DES hack to extend its lifetime before AES rode in on a white horse?</p>

				<p>A precedent for this sort of thing was started with Stuxnet. Did the Americans not think that this would come back at them? True that this was an attack on the industrial capacity of a sovereign state, but so was Stuxnet. If this crime has to be prosecuted and the perpetrators brought to justice then so do the Stuxnet perpetrators need to be brought to justice, and the United States should reveal what it knows. What&#8217;s good for the goose is good for the gander.</p>

<p>I do not understand what you mean here? What is the relation with cryptocurrencies?</p>

				<p>Chelloveck: Using an analogy from backups and other computer disasters (disk crashes), losing business creates a hit.  The loss can be so great as to bankrupt a business. If as you say, the billing information has been lost then, the worst case scenario has occurred.</p>

				<p>@Etienne well stated. pulling the plug is the best solution. blocking enemy states &amp; friendlies is a necessity. disconnecting, from the internet or whatever, isolation, is a good prevention. and; nsa approved equipment&#8211;I assume they won&#8217;t be built with Communist Chinese components, correct?</p>

				<p>@Clive You are right in that &#8220;being tough on&#8230;&#8221; isn&#8217;t a solution, but isolation is a valid security measure.</p>
<p>@etienne proposes cutting off bitcoin / anonymous transactions. the idea is akin to what killed pirating. if you can&#8217;t dock your boat, what&#8217;s the point on pirating? without being able to be paid, what&#8217;s the point of ransomware?</p>

				<p>I am wondering if this will affect oil prices. Also, I don&#8217;t think that nation states will go for ransomeware attacks since they are probably well funded but maybe that&#8217;s what they want us to think.</p>

				<p>One good thing that has come out of this incident is, that Colonial did not pay the ransomware. The debate to pay or not to pay seems to be over.  Don&#8217;t reward and encourage bad, criminal or terrorist behavior.</p>
<p>Another good thing that has come out is the reversal of DarkSide &#8220;that we never intended to harm.&#8221; They know they went too far. This is not just a ransomware attack, it is a real serious cyberattack attacking US infrastructure that has many ramifications. Fuel, financial, industrial, transportation&#8211;which will affect everything&#8211;groceries, framing, healthcare, pharmaceuticals. The repercussions should &amp; could be severe&#8211;both to DarkSide and any country giving them safe harbor&#8211;if the Biden administration has the spine to do it. In fact, it could lead to a united front to hunt down DarkSide and shut them down with prison sentences. The response to this event will set a precedent.</p>

				<p>@Wong Stuxnet was different and does not compare to the Colonial Pipeline attack. Stuxnet was a military target and not infrastructure. Stuxnet never asked for ransom nor, wanted ransom.  Stuxnet was a subtle, life preserving attack instead of bombing a belligerent nuclear weapons facility. For which the Iranians, ought to take heed and be thankful. Otherwise, one day, someone is going to blow up that reactor and there will probably be lots of collateral damage as well as scientists being killed&#8211;intentionally.</p>
<p>Taking out a military research facility or reactor is not the same as shutting down a bridge, the electric grid or; petroleum distribution to the pumps of civilians and; asking for ransom to restore the process.</p>

				<p>@Givon Zirkind,</p>
<ol>
<li>If they say they did not pay, that is pretty hard proof that they paid.</li>
<li>Intentions do not matter.  Only modalities matter.  You do not protect against intentions; you protect against modalities.  Remember the Einstein anecdote about the weapons of World Wars III and IV.  It is now clear that the weapon of WW III will be software and that the war will begin and end with a single keypress.</li>
