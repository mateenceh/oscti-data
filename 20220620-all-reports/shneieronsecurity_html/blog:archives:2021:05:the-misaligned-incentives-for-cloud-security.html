		<h2 class="entry">The Misaligned Incentives for Cloud Security</h2>
		<p>Russia&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55321643">Sunburst cyberespionage campaign</a>, discovered late last year, impacted more than 100 large companies and US federal agencies, including the Treasury, Energy, Justice, and Homeland Security departments. A crucial part of the Russians&#8217; success was their ability to move through these organizations by <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/collateral/en/wp-m-unc2452.pdf">compromising cloud and local network identity systems</a> to then access cloud accounts and pilfer emails and files.</p>
<p>Hackers said by the US government to have been working for the Kremlin <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/collateral/en/wp-m-unc2452.pdf">targeted</a> a widely used Microsoft cloud service that synchronizes user identities. The hackers <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/solarwinds-campaign-focuses-attention-on-golden-saml-attack-vector/d/d-id/1339794">stole security certificates</a> to <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/crowdstrike-launches-free-tool-to-identify-and-help-mitigate-risks-in-azure-active-directory/">create</a> their own identities, which allowed them to <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/solarwinds-post-compromise-hunting-with-azure-sentinel/ba-p/1995095">bypass</a> safeguards such as multifactor authentication and gain access to Office 365 accounts, impacting thousands of users at the affected companies and government agencies.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t the first time cloud services were the focus of a cyberattack, and it certainly won&#8217;t be the last. Cloud weaknesses were also <a href="https://www.securonix.com/web/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Securonix_Threat_Research_Capital_One_Cyberattack.pdf">critical</a> in a 2019 breach at <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/business/capital-one-data-breach/index.html">Capital One</a>. There, an Amazon Web Services cloud vulnerability, <a href="https://blog.cloudsploit.com/a-technical-analysis-of-the-capital-one-hack-a9b43d7c8aea">compounded</a> by Capital One&#8217;s own <a href="https://www.cloudpassage.com/articles/preventing-a-capital-one-cloud-data-breach/">struggle</a> to properly configure a complex cloud service, led to the disclosure of tens of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/business/capital-one-data-breach/index.html">millions</a> of customer records, including credit card applications, Social Security numbers, and bank account information.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/broken-trust-lessons-from-sunburst/">trend of attacks</a> on cloud services by criminals, hackers, and nation states is <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/report-attacks-cloud-services/">growing</a> as cloud computing takes over worldwide as the default model for information technologies. Leaked data is bad enough, but disruption to the cloud, even an outage at a single provider, could quickly cost the global economy <a href="https://www.lloyds.com/~/media/files/news-and-insight/risk-insight/2018/cloud-down/aircyberlloydspublic2018final.pdf">billions of dollars a day</a>.</p>
<p>Cloud computing is an important source of risk both because it has quickly supplanted traditional IT and because it concentrates ownership of design choices at a very small number of companies. First, cloud is increasingly the default mode of computing for organizations, meaning ever more users and critical data from national intelligence and defense agencies ride on these technologies. Second, cloud computing services, especially those supplied by the world&#8217;s four largest providers &#8212; Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba, and Google &#8212; concentrate key security and technology design choices inside a small number of organizations. The consequences of bad decisions or poorly made trade-offs can quickly scale to hundreds of millions of users.</p>
<p>The cloud is everywhere. Some cloud companies provide software as a service, support your Netflix habit, or carry your Slack chats. Others provide computing infrastructure like business databases and storage space. The largest cloud companies provide both.</p>
<p>The cloud can be deployed in several different ways, each of which shift the balance of responsibility for the security of this technology. But the cloud provider plays an important role in every case. Choices the provider makes in how these technologies are designed, built, and deployed <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/forms/gated-form.html?docID=59d987b2-5df5-4fa2-a6b3-f9f7c204140f">influence the user&#8217;s security</a> &#8212; yet the user has very little influence over them. Then, if Google or Amazon has a vulnerability in their servers &#8212; which you are unlikely to know about and have no control over &#8212; you suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>The problem is one of economics. On the surface, it might seem that competition between cloud companies gives them an incentive to invest in their users&#8217; security. But several market failures <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/23/opinion/solarwinds-hack.html">get in the way</a> of that ideal. First, security is largely an externality for these cloud companies, because the losses due to data breaches are largely borne by their users. As long as a cloud provider isn&#8217;t losing customers by the droves &#8212; which generally doesn&#8217;t happen after a security incident &#8212; it is incentivized to underinvest in security. Additionally, <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/~/media/worktribe/output-1476796/impact-of-cyber-attacks-on-stock-performance-a-comparative-study.pdf">data shows</a> that investors don&#8217;t punish the cloud service companies either: Stock price dips after a public security breach are both small and temporary.</p>
<p>Second, public information about cloud security generally doesn&#8217;t share the design trade-offs involved in building these cloud services or provide much transparency about the resulting risks. While cloud companies have to publicly disclose copious amounts of security design and operational information, it can be impossible for consumers to understand which threats the cloud services are taking into account, and how. This lack of understanding makes it hard to assess a cloud service&#8217;s overall security. As a result, customers and users aren&#8217;t able to differentiate between secure and insecure services, so they don&#8217;t base their buying and use decisions on it.</p>
<p>Third, cybersecurity is complex &#8212; and even more complex when the cloud is involved. For a customer like a company or government agency, the security dependencies of various cloud and on-premises network systems and services can be subtle and hard to map out. This means that users can&#8217;t adequately assess the security of cloud services or how they will interact with their own networks. This is a classic &#8220;lemons market&#8221; in economics, and the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_fall19_12_geer.pdf">result</a> is that cloud providers provide variable levels of security, as documented by Dan Geer, the chief information security officer for In-Q-Tel, and Wade Baker, a professor at Virginia Tech&#8217;s College of Business, when they looked at the prevalence of severe security findings at the top 10 largest cloud providers. Yet most consumers are none the wiser.</p>
<p>The result is a market failure where cloud service providers don&#8217;t compete to provide the best security for their customers and users at the lowest cost. Instead, cloud companies take the chance that they won&#8217;t get hacked, and past experience tells them they can weather the storm if they do. This kind of decision-making and priority-setting takes place at the executive level, of course, and doesn&#8217;t reflect the dedication and technical skill of product engineers and security specialists. The effect of this underinvestment is pernicious, however, by piling on risk that&#8217;s largely hidden from users. Widespread adoption of cloud computing carries that risk to an organization&#8217;s network, to its customers and users, and, in turn, to the wider internet.</p>
<p>This aggregation of cybersecurity risk creates a national security challenge. Policymakers <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/broken-trust-lessons-from-sunburst/">can help</a> address the challenge by setting clear expectations for the security of cloud services &#8212; and for making decisions and design trade-offs about that security transparent. The Biden administration, including newly nominated National Cyber Director Chris Inglis, should lead an interagency effort to work with cloud providers to review their threat models and evaluate the security architecture of their various offerings. This effort to require greater transparency from cloud providers and exert more scrutiny of their security engineering efforts should be accompanied by a push to modernize cybersecurity regulations for the cloud era.</p>
<p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), which is the principal US government program for assessing the risk of cloud services and authorizing them for use by government agencies, would be a prime vehicle for these efforts. A recent executive order <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/everything-you-need-know-about-new-executive-order-cybersecurity">outlines several steps</a> to make FedRAMP faster and more responsive. But the program is still focused largely on the security of individual services rather than the cloud vendors&#8217; deeper architectural choices and threat models. Congressional action should reinforce and extend the executive order by adding new obligations for vendors to provide transparency about design trade-offs, threat models, and resulting risks. These changes could help transform FedRAMP into a more effective tool of security governance even as it becomes faster and more efficient.</p>
<p>Cloud providers have become important national infrastructure. Not since the heights of the mainframe era between the 1960s and early 1980s has the world witnessed computing systems of such complexity used by so many but designed and created by so few. The security of this infrastructure demands greater transparency and public accountability &#8212; if only to match the consequences of its failure.</p>

				<p>I have a lot of problems with this article.  We need to call out the difference between IaaS providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, etc) and SaaS providers (e.g. basically everyone else &#8211; slack, servicenow, etc).  AWS and Azure have great incentives to invest in security for their respective platforms and they do.  And breaches that took place on AWS have generally misconfigurations of a service* not a vulnerability.</p>
<p>On the other hand &#8211; SaaS providers provide little or no information on information security practices.  We have found providers that do not log security events, hard code credentials in code, etc.  We had one provider give us code that gave us admin on their git repos.  These are the real problem.</p>
<p>We must also call out that the vast majority of company&#8217;s overall risk reduces when they move into a cloud provider because &#8211; lets face it &#8211; most organizations can&#8217;t run a toaster let alone a complex data center environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Case in point:  Capital One&#8217;s multiple failures are directly attributed to the misconfiguration of basic services.  In wasn&#8217;t &#8220;complex&#8221;.  In essence they failed Security Governance 101.  It wasn&#8217;t an AWS issue.</li>
</ul>

				<p>@ Bruce, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>Cloud computing is an important source of <b>risk</b> both because it has quickly supplanted traditional IT and because it concentrates ownership of design choices at a very small number of companies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Real should have the word &#8220;avoidable&#8221; in front of &#8220;risk&#8221;.</p>
<p>The simple fact is in all to many places these days the view of many about the Cloud in it&#8217;s many aberrant forms is changing from &#8220;avoidable&#8221; to &#8220;required&#8221;.</p>
<p>Whilst this might have some truth for more esoteric uses, as we know many of those uses involve the collection and processing of data that involvrs PII or is in some other way toxic.</p>
<p>Further analysis shows that at best these uses are at best marginal and in reality based on a faux market.</p>
<p>Such faux markets are often &#8220;bubble markets&#8221; in that they inflate without substance and either deflate as quickly or just burst. The result is that what was marginal at best becomes a significant cost.</p>
<p>What we know of the Cloud suggests that when something is at best marginal and becomes a cost, it gets dumped quickly, and any data becomes effectively orphaned, thus no longer under responsible control.</p>
<p>Such loss of control means one of three things,</p>
<p>1, Divested as scrap.<br />
2, Divested as &#8220;fire sale&#8221;.<br />
3, Divested by receivers.</p>
<p>With no legal control over the method of divestment or what future acquires may do with it.</p>
<p>Thus the toxic data ceases to be constrained and just gets thrown into the general environment to rise up and critically effect those who&#8217;s PII etc is in that data.</p>
<p>There needs to be very strong legislation to stop this happening, not just because bubbles burst, but also &#8220;faux bankruptcy&#8221; is a very effective way of removing contractual obligations, and even regulations and legislative constraint.</p>

				<p>There&#8217;s also that cloud providers can have different scope of security expectations than your traditional security groups. For example, Microsoft does not consider auditing and monitoring to be directly in the security space; yet NIST and (in our case) the Canadian counterparts put this sort of thing directly in the control catalogues, etc. This is especially true in the software development training; I find this fascinating in light of &#8220;devsecops&#8221; and agile ideas.</p>
<p>Another factor can be labled as &#8220;bandwagoning&#8221; &#8211; groups can adopt cloud technologies without (for example) necessary prerequisite software development maturity because it solves other problems in such maturity (like how to provision virtual machines). This is partially effective and initial successes will happen &#8211; but without sustainable, self-applicable practices, one hits walls. These are all made worse by artificial deadlines and other &#8220;bureaucratic&#8221; self inflicted wounds.</p>
<p>Yet another is that &#8220;because everything is code&#8221; barriers to entry for software development are a low; this is good and bad. I&#8217;m all for &#8220;software development for the people&#8221; but some of these tools (Power BI, for example) do not play nice this way and it encourages the (dangerous) attitude that software development = programming, when of course that&#8217;s a part-to-whole relation at best, not an identity.</p>

				<p>You&#8217;d think that a security blog would have some sort of protection from comments that escape their comment box and block the actual thread. Alas, this isn&#8217;t the world we live in, but it did illustrate the point at least somewhat.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m really fed up with seeing the same nonsense happen again and again for all the same reasons. As usual it&#8217;s pretty much known knowns all the way. The US is a big presence in the global market and the hands off attitude to &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221; and business regulation allows for innovation but also comes with a heavy price in terms of misinformation and dodgy products. Taking a large axe to the transatlantic pipe would solve a lot of problems.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a case of too many people trying to be clever and empire building. Who needs the headache?</p>

				<p>On a slightly related topic, the Friday Squid with the id=comment-380146 has some 30k lines of crap that may foul any rendering of the blog topic.</p>

Maybe a home page anchor or link can be made available to alert those that frequent the blog of problems and issues relating to use&#8211;not a policy page but a problems or issues page.</p>

				<p>As mention earlier by @ Keith Douglas, there is a continuous stream of problem and solution mis-identification. When systemic design and development issues create a constant vector to unacceptable risk, maybe the model is broken. Much ink continues to be spilled on issues surrounding technological development, some of it here. Where the highway that we occupy continues to have a probability of failure at a nearly constant 1, the ability to address and solve these issues has the inverse continuum of a probability of zero.</p>
<p>With the lack of attention to the basics, there is no hope in the ever widening gap between the need to provide integrity versus the motivation and actions made of greed. Until a serious introspection by the players in these markets, we will be left to to look on and say WTF.</p>

				<p>@Clive,</p>
<p>&#8220;What we know of the Cloud suggests that when something is at best marginal and becomes a cost, it gets dumped quickly, and any data becomes effectively orphaned, thus no longer under responsible control.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is why I stopped backing up my personal files to the cloud, even though I encrypted the folder before the backup software supposedly encrypted before transfer and then kept the data encrypted at rest on their computers.</p>
<p>I realized at some point that no matter how much I trusted the company, the assets of that company might be transferred to some other company that was going to do with my data whatever they wanted.</p>

				<p>In Australia cyber-security (for government entities) is managed by the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) who publish a set of standards. They also provide an independent certification and training for security experts.<br />
Any cloud provider who supplies services to the Aus Gov (including both federal and state) must be certified to the appropriate level. Many non-gov clients pay a lot of attention to these certifications, meaning that there is a significant incentive for providers to comply.</p>
<p>Also, data sovereignty is a significant point and it is mandated that all secure information must be stored on machines physically located in Australia. Some exceptions apply as long as the security controls are sufficient, but storing anything in the US is right out due to the known issues &#8211; especially intercept by US intelligence agencies.</p>

				<p>Good article.  Some notes on cloud adoption:</p>
<p>&#8212;  The largest customers are still streaming media.  FinSvcs is still skeptical.  Most banks and oil companies are listed as &#8216;customers&#8217;, but most are not running backend core txp business in the cloud.  It&#8217;s limited to customer-facing systems.  They are getting closer, though.<br />
&#8212;  Moving to the cloud is not a technical decision.  IT is not driving adoption, CFO are.  Cloud svcs move long-term capital expenditure to operating expenses, written off quarterly.  (CFOs hate capX, particularly from non-revenue generating centers.)<br />
&#8212;  There isn&#8217;t enough security talent available to run enterprise systems correctly today.  (I don&#8217;t know how our lights are still on.)<br />
&#8212;  Many companies do not understand or handle the demarcation of liability/responsibility between themselves and cloud providers well at all.  Their contract defines each party&#8217;s responsibilities, so it needs to be deeply considered by management and reflected in operations.  Law looms larger in IT now.<br />
&#8212;  Small/medium companies (SME) don&#8217;t have the corp management, will, or talent to operate safely.  They will likely operate better with industry cloud svcs.</p>
<p>But, you still have the aggregated risk.  Do you trust AWS and the others to handle it?</p>
<p>My tech buddies (SABI/RTB types) say that container security on the cloud has gotten &#8220;pretty good&#8221;.  It would be very good to have a TTP certify that.</p>
<p>AWS has quietly recognized that customers can hurt themselves misconfiguring their infrastructure and that is bad for business.  They have been developing &#8220;pretty good&#8221; AI (e.g. zelkova, tiros) for customer tools to scan IAM policies and network services, etc. and they do seem pretty determined about it.</p>
<p>Which is all good stuff, but it still takes a genius to put a secure enterprise infrastructure together, coordinating and maintaining all the policies.</p>
