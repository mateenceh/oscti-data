				<p>There are two conflicting versions of this story out. Another says that they encryption keys were stolen, and the other story says that those weren&#8217;t. I were left wondering which version of the story is actually true story, or maybe nobody actually knows even this date?</p>

				<p>Centralizing master keys in one facility is setting up a SPOF, Single Point of Failure.</p>
<p><i>But in fact, Leetham says, one server on RSA’s internet-connected network was linked, through a firewall that allowed no other connections, to the seed warehouse on the manufacturing side.</i></p>
<p>Nice design! Air-gapped and back-doored at the same time&#8230; SecurID is an older design based on different assumptions, but why wouldn&#8217;t the end-customers generate their seeds locally using appropriate hardware?</p>
<p>Calling the NSA for help in fixing your problems, even during a crisis, isn&#8217;t really reassuring for customers, especially foreign ones. After all, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/02/19/great-sim-heist/" rel="nofollow ugc">NSA helped themselves</a> to a French manufacturer&#8217;s seeds for programming mobile phone SIMs&#8230;</p>
<p>The amusing/ironical/shocking bit in this story is that it happened to a company that files patents with titles such as &#8220;Storing digital secrets in a vault&#8221; (US7739733, filed 2005) or &#8220;System and method for detecting fraudulent transactions&#8221; (WO2007044763, filed 2005).</p>
<p>The SecurID rolling codes fobs are somewhat goofy, I was never issued one myself, but saw others use them. I wondered about clock drift and battery replacement, but my urge to investigate deeply hasn&#8217;t been quite strong enough.</p>
<p>In Europe, German banks initially relied on a sheet of paper with 100 random 6-digit codes for security (&#8220;TAN-Verfahren&#8221;). When completing a transaction, the web site would ask you for a given code. Initially these were exhausted sequentially beginning with 1, but circa 2008 they realized that this wasn&#8217;t secure, as sophisticated phishing suites with screen-grabbers and key-loggers, or fake banking sites, would trick users into entering extraneous codes, which would then be used by crooks to siphon their accounts. Challenges were then picked at random withing the 100 group. When a sheet was exhausted, a new one could be obtained through the post.</p>
<p>This still wasn&#8217;t secure enough, and the EU forced banks to improve in the last few years.</p>
<p>The current system used by my own bank is a small device (~4cm x 6cm x 8mm) with a camera and a display that you point at a color dot pattern shown on your computer monitor. The dots can be saturated R, G, B, or white, so overall there would be roughly around 1000 bits of info in a typical 25&#215;25 square grid. The pattern contains not only the challenge, but also a description of the proposed transaction, which you can verify on the device&#8217;s display. You type back a 7-digit response, and that&#8217;s it. The device is quite fast, it takes about seconds to power-up (you could warm it up as you log into the banking app/site), and 1 second to point the camera, grab the challenge, and complete a transaction.</p>
<p>Devices are shipped blank, but are activated with a special printed pattern which you must keep secure.</p>
<p>Already in the 1990s, challenge-response calculators (a small keyboard and a LCD 7 segment display) were provided by some banks in the Netherlands. The challenge and response had either 6 or 7 digits, I&#8217;m not sure anymore.</p>
<p>Using smart phones for 2FA makes me cringe.</p>

				<p>@ Tatütata,</p>
<blockquote><p>The current system used by my own bank is a small device (~4cm x 6cm x 8mm) with a camera and a display that you point at a color dot pattern shown on your computer monitor.

<p>It&#8217;s not secure, it breaks the cardinal rule of,</p>
<p><b>The transaction must go through the user.</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same reason Secure Messaging Apps are not secure as it alows the communications channel to &#8220;reach around&#8221; the &#8220;security end point&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>One of the designers of the first system was at the UK Cambridge Computer labs and put an article up on it quite some time ago on the &#8220;lightbluetouchpapet.org&#8221; blog. I pointed out over a lengthy discussion that it was easily subject to &#8220;covert channels&#8221; and just one of the ways I would do it.</p>
<p>Whilst I&#8217;m not yet aware of anyone doing it, a supply chain attack on the device would be the starting point. Such attacks have already happened on supermarket (UK Sainsburies) ePOS devices and on those &#8220;pay at the table&#8221; systems used in restaurants.</p>
<p>As these &#8220;banking devices&#8221; are effectively &#8220;sold by the pallet&#8221; at the lowest possible price the banks can force them doen to, it&#8217;s doubtfull that &#8220;security&#8221; of the supply chain even figures in the unit pricing. The best you could hope for realistically is a &#8220;tamper evident seal&#8221; on the device and maybe one on the individual shipping carton which would be trivial to bypass.</p>
<p>So an attack on them will almost certainly happen at some point the only question is &#8220;when&#8221;.</p>

				<p>Tatütata<br />
We use the RSA thingy here at work.  They deal with the battery issue by having an expiration date on the back of the fob which is before the expected time the battery would die.</p>
<p>Once a year or so I&#8217;ve had to call helldesk to get my fob resynchronized, so clock drift happens.</p>

				<p>@ Tatütata,</p>
<p>Forgot to mention, your bit calculation is of &#8220;RGBW&#8221; gives &#8220;2bits per dot&#8221;.</p>
<p>Secondly,</p>
<blockquote><p>Using smart phones for 2FA makes me cringe.</p></blockquote>
<p>Every one has &#8220;their crosses to bare&#8221; using a mobile phone as a &#8220;reliable&#8221; side channel, is one of mine&#8230;</p>
<p>SMS is a secondary service thus there was originally no promise of reliable delivery just &#8220;maybe&#8221; not &#8220;best effort&#8221;. I worked out a way to reduce the issue to be acceptable back in the 1990&#8217;s and I pushed the idea of &#8220;mobile phone&#8221; use to replace TANs-n-Tokens as people who have mobile phones tend to &#8220;keep them handy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Smart phones were not yet a thing back in the 1990&#8217;s, and mobile phone service providers had way better security back then as illicit long distance phone calls using &#8220;cloned phones&#8221; and the like was realy hurting their business model back then.</p>
<p>So whilst I have some excuse, I&#8217;m still the person who started it becoming &#8220;the one true way&#8221;&#8230; Thus you can imagine how big my cringes are just seeing people still doing it&#8230;</p>

&#8220;It’s not secure, it breaks the cardinal rule of,<br />
The transaction must go through the user.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have used such a device. It simply produces a number after you entered a pin. You have to fill in number with the transaction.</p>
<p>You probably are right that this is not secure, but the banks do not care. There simple are too few cases of successful abuse. The banks only care about the net costs. If the costs of abuse are smaller than the cost of an upgrade, they would be foolish to do the upgrade.</p>
<p>And, honestly, I have yet to hear of a case where the security was broken outside of someone taking the specific appliance and entering the correct pin.</p>

<blockquote><p>honestly, I have yet to hear of a case</p></blockquote>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said neither have I <b>YET</b>.</p>
<p>But all the pieces to do it are well established attacks already, so there is absolutly no &#8220;technical&#8221; reason why it could not have been done, a decade or more ago.</p>
<p>Especially as the cost of the devices is as both of us note &#8220;about as low as it can go&#8221;. So security is not going to feature very highly in any part of the production and delivery chains.</p>
<p>Hence as far as I am concerned it&#8217;s a question not of &#8220;if&#8221; but of &#8220;<b>WHEN</b>&#8220;.</p>

 </p></blockquote>
<p>Not per se.</p>
<p>Implementation example:<br />
&#8211; User request A currency to be transferred from account B to C<br />
&#8211; Website encapsulated that transaction in some compressed format<br />
&#8211; Website signs this with public key (used only for this purpose)<br />
&#8211; Website presents this to use in a some QR-code or dot-weirdness form<br />
&#8211; Users token scans it and it displays it<br />
&#8211; User enters pin on whatever on token<br />
&#8211; Token generates signature (after verifying bank signed the request)<br />
&#8211; User enters signature in website<br />
&#8211; Website verifies signature match</p>
<p>IMHO this would stop most attacks that I&#8217;ve heard of.</p>

				<p>@Clive</p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<p>blockquote&gt;So whilst I have some excuse, I’m still the person who started it becoming “the one true way”… Thus you can imagine how big my cringes are just seeing people still doing it…</p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<p>blockquote&gt;</p>
<p>You too? I&#8217;ve let my fingerprints on a few things. Less now as things have changed and I&#8217;ve been nudged from the front row to the backseat to the lobby although face down on the pavement may be closer still. Those fingerprints have left traces in the media or were reasons behind why a story here or there was in the media.</p>
<p>Politicians and staffers don&#8217;t have my skills so some things were fumbled at the time. One of these caused some embarassment for a very &#8220;senior&#8221; politician at the time but I understand from what little leaks out has now become integrated with standard practice. At the time they were getting a significant number of stories onto the media agenda. After my input ceased this dropped off. This leads me to one &#8220;good idea&#8221; I had at the time. I daren&#8217;t say what it is but it&#8217;s an item or issue which does become a media topic now and again and I fear may have been responsible for a shift in political strategy in some quarters which led to the current state of where we are today. I say may. It&#8217;s not that I said anything new but I feel that some people can take things as permission and it gains new legs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just say some people who crave power at any cost don&#8217;t get a joke or care about nuance and philosophical underpinnings and &#8220;good enough&#8221; can come back to bite you.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with telecoms networks and a &#8220;good enough&#8221; sub-component? These systems can be used as a model for organisations.</p>
<p>Yesterday I spent a little time explaining to the lawyer how people relied on a solid pillar of authority and how this could be unpacked and how there was a legal and scientific basis for this as well as issue of perception and developing narratives and changing the political tilt. The pillar of authority can be unfolded like a concertina revealing lots of different layers and timelines and otherwise hidden communications channels and nodes of power and points of exploit. If the lawyer didn&#8217;t get anything else I got the feeling they sensed I was on to something and suddenly that pillar of power didn&#8217;t look like the solid fortress it was thought to be. They are a capable lawyer but I was slightly surprised a lawyer of their capability hadn&#8217;t noticed this. I suppose it&#8217;s easy to do as, perhaps, an engineer or software developer may be lulled into a sense of complacency about a pillar of power, or fortress, or framework.</p>
<p>With regard the Chinese attack on RSA: &#8220;Be like water&#8221;.</p>

				<p>@Clive Robinson, re<br />
“The transaction must go through the user.”</p>
<p>I think it does (I use an older but similar device):<br />
To start the device I have to insert my bank’s debit/credit (chip) card and to enter the pin code (*). The card has to remain present during transaction.<br />
Then the device reads a flickering code from the transaction form of the PC screen,<br />
“The pattern contains not only the challenge, but also a description of the proposed transaction, which you can verify on the device’s display.” (@Tatütata)<br />
You must confirm the details of the transaction (amount and destination) by pressing “OK” on the device.<br />
Now the device calculates and displays a (hardly readable) 7-digit code which must be typed into the transaction screen by PC keyboard.</p>
<p>I think that’s a lot of user action + “chip card present and authenticated” to be inconvenient, so it might be secure even to a simple supply chain attack?</p>
<p>(*) The only problem I have here is the 4 digit pin code which is only secure when the device can render the card invalid in case of 3 bad authentication attempts &#8211;<br />
But unlike an ATM it can’t (or at least it doesn’t).</p>

<blockquote><p>Devices are shipped blank, but are activated with a special printed pattern which you must keep secure.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the &#8216;same paridigm, same problem&#8217; as the RSA SecurID.</p>
<p>There is an outside party that has the secret.</p>
<p>A better approach would be that the end user generates their own PrivateKey/PublicKey pair.  The user securely saves on paper their PrivateKey and then they enroll their PublicKey at the bank.  From a KYC perspective, make the user customer show up at bank with identification and HSM, and prove a challenge on site as part of the enrollment process.</p>
<p>The bank now has ID-PublicKey relationship.</p>
<p>The bank does not have any PrivateKey.</p>
<p>The bank can not be hacked to have any PrivateKey be exfiltrated.</p>

				<p>@ Moderator, -, Clive, Lurker, Anders, ALL</p>
<p>In the interest of messing with the troll-tool (that I expected to not disappear in spite of the faux apology), any chance you have some magic software that will automatically throw comments posted from GMT+3 until GMT+11 into moderation?</p>
<p>That would be CDT 02:00 thru 10:00 currently as CDT is on Daylight Saving Time, where the server lives.</p>
<p>Based on plenty of historical evidence, that is when they show up.</p>
<p>Should not interfere with any intel collection.  The traffic analysis will still be functional.</p>
<p>Yes, I know that is the window some of us may be here, but I think we can work-around that for a while.</p>
<p>Also, how about a link at top that goes to just after last comment?  That would make it easier to scroll backwards vs having to scroll forward thru thousands of &#8216;ones&#8217;.</p>

<p>So, PC to device.</p>
<p>Not PC to user to device.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s excluded the user, thus any number of covert channels could be in effrct and the user would not know.</p>
<p>So &#8220;rule broken&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote><p>ROTFLMAO</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not discussing anything which gives clues about the case or the particular lawyer I was discussing things with.</p>
<p>The point really was at a system theory level different equivalent systems and different points of view can have a high degree of similarities and overlap and how the different starting points can bring different skills and insights to the table. I know things and have methods and approaches most lawyers don&#8217;t because they are lawyers. The reverse is also true.</p>
<p>In some ways I am less constrained and more used to joining the dots between apparently unrelated points which may usually be overlooked to uncover hidden data or lies concealed behind a nod along truth. (This bit they got when I explained formal analysis of the broader pool of historical data and context can reveal a lack of integrity to a statement and betray a lie.) I didn&#8217;t discuss technology or any technology. I kept it at the generic discussion level with quick and dirty concepts and comparisons.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/27/how-kate-bingham-got-caught-in-the-crossfire-according-to-cummings" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/27/how-kate-bingham-got-caught-in-the-crossfire-according-to-cummings</a></p>
<blockquote><p>A venture capitalist, Bingham was appointed the unpaid chair of the UK’s vaccine taskforce in May last year and has been credited with leading a team that allowed the country to forge ahead with its vaccine programme.</p>
<p>But Cummings’ testimony described a toxic backstabbing environment in Whitehall, and how there were negative briefings against people such as Bingham from within the government.</p>
<p>Though the prime minister had asked Bingham to lead the taskforce, MPs heard the briefings against her were said to be coming from within No 10.</p></blockquote>
<p>While appearing to go off on a wild tangent I have been collecting examples of bad behaviour behind the scenes of the mask of boring authority the state sector holds up which have been leaking out. I&#8217;ll leave it to someone else to describe this as a network with nodes of power and backchannels and corrupted data and so forth. While not the best example it goes to show how a system on paper, CV polishing jobtitles who like to peddle pedestrian front ends, and informal of the record individual psychology and social networks are worth examining as it can help unpack policy positions or a particular organisational arrangement which itself can reveal more and more information and bring into question the public fortress on display. A nice shiny case can contain all maneger of bodge jobs and kludges each with their own history and reason for existing and suddenly that nice shiny case doesn&#8217;t look so appealing.</p>
<p>And there you find the shiny little nugget of truth, like the stolen RSA keys hidden within an apparently impregenable fortress. Well, that&#8217;s the plan. Most of everything about the case are known knowns. There are no mega surprises to anyone familiar with anything but it might be enough.</p>
<p>@Clive</p>
<blockquote><p>As I’ve said neither have I YET.</p>
<p>But all the pieces to do it are well established attacks already, so there is absolutly no “technical” reason why it could not have been done, a decade or more ago.</p>
<p>Especially as the cost of the devices is as both of us note “about as low as it can go”. So security is not going to feature very highly in any part of the production and delivery chains.</p>
<p>Hence as far as I am concerned it’s a question not of “if” but of “WHEN“.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve said for some years if I can think of something someone will do it or sometimes more alarmingly have already done it. Some may recall this thought crossed the mind of a senior American military officer when discovering issues with the Minuteman launch system and the fact the Russians may known about this and tampered with the cables. They may not and it may have come as much a surprise to the Russians as the Americans but the question did raise a sweat as you can imagine.</p>
<p>I have no idea if my case will be progressed with this lawyer but I&#8217;ve planted a few ideas in their head. As for whether they bear fruit or not with my case or years down the line I have no idea. They are not as bloodthirsty as me but a crack in the dam or a minor graze drawing blood can be the beginning of the inevitable.</p>
<p>The freeing and unfreeing of water over years can crack the strongest rock. A house built on sand falls. When the fire is lit the rice is already cooked. Me? I just want to retire from it all and buy a dog.</p>

<p>There must be an awful lot of surviving subjects of P.T.Barnum&#8217;s apocryphal jibe about the intelligence of the public. A large hospital here cannot continue oncological radiotherapy because the computer controlling the machine is offline, with everything else, following a ransomware attack.</p>

<p>Always possible. I have an internet footprint bigger than Bigfoot. Seriously, I am all over the place. I think I know what may have clued you in but I&#8217;ll just mention the lawyer is aware of a range of issues and if it is what I think it is it&#8217;s also a potential item of the case for reasons I won&#8217;t disclose, obviously, and not necessarily for the reasons you may suspect. I wish I could say more but that would disclose case details and strategies and possibly reveal the lawyers identity. Um, well. On to the weather, hey?</p>

I've been writing about security issues on my <a href="/">blog</a> since 2004, and in my monthly <a href="/crypto-gram/">newsletter</a> since 1998. I'm a fellow and lecturer at Harvard's <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/bruce-schneier">Kennedy School</a>, a board member of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and the Chief of Security Architecture at <a href="https://inrupt.com/">Inrupt, Inc.</a> This personal website expresses the opinions of none of those organizations.</p>
