				<p><b>11 JUNE 2021 &#8212; INTERLOPER TACTICS OF THE WEEK(END)</b><br />
<i>ATTENTION MODERATOR</i><br />
It appears that about mid afternoon 11 JUNE CDT, a targeted campaign against the blog has been initiated. Some has scraped some of the most common contributors and posting in their name. The common theme in their narrative ramblings gives it away. Keywords:<br />
ADHD, mental health, society, therapy</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t reviewed the whole stream of posts but none of the threads appear related to anything the original authors might have posted.</p>

				<p>Wife says underwater landslide, I suppose I&#8217;m way out on this one with gamma rays under water.  Maybe I should read the paper this time.</p>
<p>As for the aside, it looks to me to be a direct reposting you&#8217;ll note dated links from 2016 referencing various things. Pretty effective chaff short of a shared secret no?</p>

				<p>The other day the Colonial Pipeline CEO said that the hackers gained access through a dormant VPN account.</p>
<p>The CEO also stated that they hadn’t yet figured out how the credentials were compromised.</p>
<p>April 2021 LinkedIn experienced a breach of 500 Million user records.  What that leaked data contained is not known although LinkedIn claims it was not a breach and that no account data was included.  But LI privacy policy is vague about what constitutes private data and what they sell or share.</p>
<p>June 2016 leaked LinkedIn data resulted in a Citrix VPN breach.  Citrix called it a “password re-use attack”.   According to this article at least 30 organizations were compromised.  <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3086942/linkedin-data-breach-blamed-for-multiple-secondary-compromises.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.csoonline.com/article/3086942/linkedin-data-breach-blamed-for-multiple-secondary-compromises.html</a></p>
<p>June 2012 LinkedIn was breached &#8211; 6.5 million user accounts compromised .  Then in August 2012 the State of South Carolina Citrix portal was breached.  “Mandiant was unable to conclusively determine how the user’s credentials were obtained by the attacker”.</p>
<p>How is LinkedIn connected to Citrix?  Microsoft.</p>
<p>In Excel or Word – look at Options &gt;&gt; LinkedIn Features. See the blue box warnings about Governmental restrictions here:  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/linkedin-integration" rel="nofollow ugc">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/linkedin-integration</a></p>
<p>If the US Government, China, Germany and France think that this feature is too dangerous to use then why does it exist?</p>
<p>Is LinkedIn compiling consumer information and associating it to employer accounts without consumer approval?  It defaults to opt-in.  LinkedIn Privacy Policy says  personal data is shared with employers if a user opts into Enterprise sharing (this feature?).  Does this mean that corporate surveillance is also for sale?</p>
<p>In 2018 and 2019 Citrix again admitted to being breached due to compromised credentials but claims that only employee data was compromised.  The employee class action was just settled yesterday. <a href="https://www.citrixdatabreachsettlement.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.citrixdatabreachsettlement.com/</a></p>
<p>Are your biggest vendors selling your most confidential data to your attackers?  The Colonial Pipeline bitcoin was clawed back by the FBI in San Francisco.  It didn&#8217;t even leave the country.</p>
<p>Hopefully Senator Wyden&#8217;s &#8220;Mind Your Own Business&#8221; bill to ban the sale of personal data to foreign countries passes.    <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/15/personal-data-foreign-government-ban/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/15/personal-data-foreign-government-ban/</a></p>

				<p>@Moderator:</p>
<p>Clean up on isle13 again&#8230;</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Troll-Tools been banging away at it again, but now with darker undertones.</p>
<p>This time the Troll-Tools draging up previous handles and posts from more than a couple of years back and adulterating them to use in a form of replay attack. Pointless though that might appear they have posted a hundred or more.</p>
<p>The first Troll-Tools posting to the &#8216;friday-squid-blogging-squids-in-space.html&#8217; thread appears to be @June 11, 2021 2:59 with,</p>
<p>1, McArther #comment-381234</p>
<p>That is a new and deliberately targeted COVID conspiracy comment aimed at a specific handle.</p>
<p>Then the knuckle draging stuff runs through mainly as &#8216;cover comments&#8217; untill,</p>
<p>2, #comment-381386</p>
<p>Reading through shows only @Winter making a valid post about #comment-381234.</p>
<p>However&#8230; It would appear that the @Clive Robinson handle is now an &#8216;active target&#8217; along with @Winter with fake &#8216;discrediting comments&#8217; added to it.</p>
<p>Others handles such as @MarkH have had rude words added or their handles attached to other peoples previous comments from years back.</p>
<p>Looking back through the logs as far as I can tell the last legitimate comment from the @Clive Robinson handle was to the @echo handle on the &#8216;fbi-afp-run-encrypted-phone&#8217; thread.</p>
<p>#comment-381224 @ June 11, 2021 12:57 PM</p>
<p>The rest of the replies in that thread suggest that ordinary posters were still posting up untill,</p>
<p>@ June 11, 2021 5:47 PM.</p>
<p>Which was after the Troll-Tools paused/stopped.</p>
<p>A first cut analysis of the Troll-Tools postings suggest they are using a simple shell script to build a small database of handles and comments. These are getting &#8220;mixed and matched&#8221; to provide &#8216;cover comments&#8217; thus the same comment appears under different handles.</p>
<p>However for &#8216;active targets&#8217; either rude comments under their handles, or other replay comments are being &#8216;edited&#8217; in various ways to try to discredit them in the likes of Google etc searches. Thus the &#8216;reputational attacks&#8217; are spreading.</p>

				<p>It looks like that at least some of the ransom money paid by Colonial was seized by authorities- what does this say about the robustness of digital currencies  against state-level actors?</p>

<p>Interesting that the timeframe for Troll-tool attack changed by about 12 hours.</p>
<p>Maybe they have other plans for the weekend.</p>

				<p>Which digital currencies?<br />
What else has recently been in the news that could&#8217;ve facilitated interdiction?<br />
Which wallet was man handled, who&#8217;s purse was opened? This is after all, a referrer program and cuts and costs must be idiv.</p>
<p>Also note that all things considered, dis/misinformation serves a purpose.</p>
<p>FUD for comms<br />
FUD for finsec</p>
<p>It spreads like grease deep fried and airborne, saturating outlets that already were leak eager in a penny starved internet advertising age.</p>
<p>Someone is setting fire to fire ants.</p>
<p>Run!</p>
<p>How many have agendas, how many want to be the next intercept?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not even sure ANOM short of cooperation from 5i.au would be legally pheasible stateside so maybe it was a house plant, homegrown sure but they spent how many man hours to develop this thing and then just burn it?</p>
<p>I have it on a lark.</p>

				<p>@ Ismar,</p>
<blockquote><p>what does this say about the robustness of digital currencies against state-level actors?</p></blockquote>
<p>There is way to little fact and way to much supposition in that Dan Goodin piece for any conclusions to be drawn.</p>
<p>For instance it&#8217;s known that the US Government has already got a stock of bitcoin from previous FBI activities (one FBI agent actually tried stealing some, a few years back and got caught).</p>
<p>Thus that 75 BitCoin may not have been purchased by ColPipe but only used by the FBI.</p>
<p>As for grabbing DarkSides electronic wallet they FBI might have done if the DarkSide operators were stupid enough to keep it in a system that could be reached by communications. Various attackers have done this from time to time already.</p>
<p>As for the passwords required, if you can &#8220;grab the wallet&#8221; then you can &#8220;key-log&#8221; the keyboard&#8230;</p>
<p>But it might be simpler&#8230;</p>
<p>As I noted a couple of days back DarkSide operated a &#8220;full service ransomware service&#8221; and charged around a 20% fee.</p>
<p>Thus it is possible that the originator of the attack was a disgruntled ColPipe employee. If you search on line you will discover their CEO was not liked at all by employees. Hardly supprising when you find out which companies ColPipe actually &#8220;fronts for&#8221;, for various tax avoidence and effectively money laundering reasons including bungs to politico&#8217;s etc.</p>
<p>So it is entirely possible a simple &#8220;CommSec&#8221; failure was responsible for the 63 bit coin recovery. That is the BitCoins went to DarkSide who took their cut then sent the rest on to the disgruntled employee in a bitcoin wallet with the balance in it along with the wallet password. If it got &#8220;intercepted on route&#8221; or &#8220;pulled&#8221; from the disgruntled employees computer then recovery would not be difficult.</p>
<p>Mind you &#8220;recovered&#8221; is an ambiguous word when it comes to encrypted information. That is you can &#8220;recover&#8221; encrypted information, but without the encryption key they remain worthless even though you in theory possess them&#8230;</p>
<p>So the FBI might have a BitCoin wallet with BitCoins in it but no password because the previous owner of the wallet has not handed it over for various reasons or even spoken to the FBI (actually a wise thing to do). Thus the FBI could be trying to &#8220;brut force&#8221; the wallet pass phrase as we speak[1]&#8230;</p>
<p>But we don&#8217;t know, as there is little or no reliable information only the minimum required for court proceedings. So it&#8217;s all speculation untill we get further reliable facts (which is actually not that likely for a while).</p>
<p>[1] Which may prove futile, in that the previous owner of the wallet could have picked a sentance or paragraph from a well known poem or book and added a few bits extra then run it through a hash algorithm a number of times. That number decided by say a telephone number or other publicly available information that can be turned into a number. Whilst both the search space and combinations are &#8220;finite&#8221; that in now way means that it can be found in the length of time the Universe is believed to have left.</p>

				<p>Yesterday China announces they arrested 1,100 Bitcoin cross-border money launderers.  So apparently China can now trace Bitcoin too.</p>

<p>News media reporting major COVID outbreak of Bitcoin conference attendees.  Oh no.  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/miami-bitcoin-gathering-was-a-covid-hot-spot-attendees-say" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/miami-bitcoin-gathering-was-a-covid-hot-spot-attendees-say</a></p>
<p>If I was the CIA I would have invented crypto.  I’m old enough to know that this makes the most sense,</p>
<p>@Clive</p>
<p>I never heard anyone blame a ransomware attack on a CEO because he’s not a nice guy.  You have to be mighty stupid to want your employer or even ex employer to be attacked by ransomware.  Because this means no payroll, no insurance.  900 employees work for the biggest pipeline in the USA that you say is a fake front but Bitcoin is somehow valid.  You can easily see Colonial pipeline infrastructure when you fly into NYC or Newark.  I’ve never seen Bitcoin though.  Have you?</p>

<p>None of the tactics are actually brand spanking new.  It&#8217;s just that you did see them at the time because you were not looking at the wrong time in aisle 13.  And after @Moderator zapped them, you would not know they had existed.  They did.</p>
<p>The pulling up of old comments and modifying them is relatively new, maybe started about  two months ago.  I do not recall exactly.  I believe one of my old comments that was doctored and posted but was not zapped is still findable.</p>

<p>Interesting attack via Floating Point MicroCode.</p>
<p>Make sure your FireFox is current.  Can not speak for other browsers.</p>
<p>The demo shows FireFox pre version 87.0 can leak via this attack.</p>
<p>Note:  This is not a browser problem per se.  This is a microcode problem.  So any attacker controlled data possibly can effect any program that uses Floating Point.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll say it again:  Fast does not mean safe.</p>
<p>Rage Against the Machine Clear</p>
<p>A Systematic Analysis of Machine Clears and Their Implications for Transient Execution Attacks</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vusec.net/projects/fpvi-scsb/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.vusec.net/projects/fpvi-scsb/</a></p>
<p>INTEL – CVE-2021-0086 / AMD – CVE-2021-26314</p>
<p>FPVI allows an attacker to inject arbitrary floating-point values in a transient execution window created by a Floating-Point machine clear. With this attack primitive we can mount an end-to-end exploit on the latest Mozilla SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine with all the mitigations enabled, resulting in an arbitrary memory read in Firefox through attacker-controlled and transiently-injected floating-point results (FIREFOX – CVE-2021-29955).</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Affected CPUs</p>
<p>Both Intel and AMD processors are affected by FPVI and SCSB. In Figure 8 we list the CPUs we tested in our experiments. Intel published the complete list of all its affected processors (Columns FPVI &amp; SCSB). AMD confirmed that all its CPUs are affected. ARM confirmed our results of not being affected by SCSB and reported that some FPU implementations are affected by FPVI.</p>

A loop 100k times might not be that effective as it looks, it would slow down the bruteforce but getting information from a 64 char poem might still show, as you can do the loop and use that as a table attack instead of just once?</p>

<p>This is a Master&#8217;s Thesis from 2013, detailing 6 patients in 2012 whose symptoms present identical to covid-19 after contracting a mystery disease after working in caves in the region. 5 of 6 died, and the samples for these cases ended up at the Wuhan Institute of virology. Since we were unable to link the wet market theory as an initial origin, logic dictates after discovering this master&#8217;s thesis the next focus should have been the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where gain of function research was taking place, however the CCP denied the world access until early this year hindering a timely investigation. Knowing these details the likely scenario is the lab leak theory, especially knowing this isn&#8217;t the first time researchers from this lab were accidentally infected with samples they were working on.</p>
<p>Any calls for investigation of the origin as being from a lab were shut down by parties with severe conflicts of interest. Even worse when people said lab leak, the media and any other detractors would conflate that with b weapon and use that to pound the “conspiracy theory” home. When there is quite a significant amount of data of previous lab leaks. Here is a story highlighting several near misses at UNC-CH where Ralph Baric works. These labs have worked with the WIV on multiple coronavirus studies.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Near Misses at UNC Chapel Hill’s High-Security Lab Illustrate Risk of Accidents With Coronaviruses<br />
  Reports indicate UNC researchers were potentially exposed to lab-created coronaviruses in several incidents since 2015. These incidents highlight the risks even in the most secure and respected research facilities.

<p>It may well end up that they were doing studies on these viruses and an accidental leak occurred but the scientists panicked because to admit how risky what they were doing is/was would out their future in jeopardy, so you control the narrative.</p>

				<p>@ No one,</p>
<p>Another &#8220;new handle&#8221;?</p>
<p>It is curious that you make the, Reuters link on Bitcoin non clickable, yet the Bloomberg link on COVID clickable&#8230; I wonder why?</p>
<p>But things get even stranger with you,</p>
<blockquote><p>I never heard anyone blame a ransomware attack on a CEO because he’s not a nice guy.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is quite a peculiar statment to make&#8230;</p>
<p>You will find, if you can be bothered to check, most organisational culture is shaped or set by the CEO, or those appointed by the CEO into managment positions.</p>
<p>Likewise the reality of ransom attacks against IT systems over more than the past five decades have almost always been by people usually insiders or ex-insiders upset by an organisation and it&#8217;s culture as it effects them (and often why they became ex-insiders).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the reason the US CFAA 1986, that recently got spiked by SCOTUS, was supposadly written the way it was. As US CCAA 1984 (18 U.S.C § 1030) that preceded it was not sufficiently &#8220;encompassing&#8221;. Likewise the original UK legislation CMA 1990 because the UK Fraud Act was found to be wanting in IT access cases. The main use of the UK CMA though caused a number of contractors to be prosecuted because in self defence they added code that caused the code they had written under contract to stop working if they were not payed. Which at the time was rife in the industry because of Senior Managment thinking they could pull a &#8220;No Pay, Won&#8217;t Pay, Cause you can&#8217;t sue or take it away&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only in the past half decade that outsider ransom of ICT systems has become more normal as &#8220;Nerds learned to Crime&#8221;, Or more importantly how to &#8220;get away with the proceeds&#8221; of ransoming which was the usuall point that people committing ransom failed and were thus apprehend, arrested, tried and usually convicted.</p>
<p>So, the question arises,</p>
<p>Are you deliberately disingenuous, disengaged from reality, or just unknowledgable of what has happened in the ICT sector for over half a century?</p>
