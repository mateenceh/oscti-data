				<p>How market research reveals what you really think<br />
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57399780" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57399780</a></p>
<p>Many interesting points involving AI.</p>
<p>My attention was caught by this segment:</p>
<p>&#8220;The scale of data that can be manipulated in the cloud has grabbed the attention of the whole market research industry. Jon Puleston analyses online material for consumer research giant Kantar and revels in this new element: &#8220;We are producing oil tankers of data and the cloud is allowing us to refine it.&#8221;</p>
<p>By plunging into the cloud with its own software Kantar confirmed that we are incapable of being truthful to market researchers trying to establish what really floats our boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talking to a camera is a very effective tool, but<br />
==&gt; what people say is often miles apart from what they feel, there are so many unconscious factors at play.&#8221;</p>
<p>!!!!Specialist software pointed at filmed responses taps into these unconscious factors via clues such as tone of voice and facial expression. This tells Mr Puleston we are very hard on ourselves over our guilty pleasures, such as watching a rom-com.</p>
<p>==&gt;When we are asked to rate a film our natural instinct is to mark down a lightweight movie although we&#8217;ve really enjoyed it and lie about how we liked one with intellectual content. We might be giving the serious show a four star rating, but in truth we only got emotionally involved with the rom-com story.</p>
<p>Kantar applies AI to a bank of human emotions recorded on film and assembled in the cloud and demystifies our real sentiments. This unlocks the ingredients of a Hollywood crowd-pleaser.</p>
<p>Market researchers may have given up knocking on our front doors with their clipboards, but technology is allowing them to get inside our heads.&#8221;</p>

				<p><b>18 JUN 2021 &#8212; Conspiracy Theories in Counter-Terrorism</b></p>
<p>SATIRICAL EXAMPLE &#8212; Background<br />
In conspiratorial tropes that are part of political action or authoritarian propaganda is a model that does one of two things; in the political realm the need to sway perception in the face of truth, in maintaining a authoritarian governance organization is required to maintain the hold on power.</p>
<p>I offer a counter-conspiracy conspiracy that targets a current series of efforts that are affecting the polity in the U.S., here it is (both as an example response and dual-use satire:</p>
<p>PREFACE TO CONSPIRACY<br />
Where or what is the origins of the Marjorie Taylor Greene&#8217;s of the U.S. (Matt Gaetz for example) is explained by the following facts (wink/dog whistle).</p>
<p>UNDERLYING ORIGINS<br />
Over thirty years ago; From a press release in Taiwan, from an article published in a Hong Kong newspaper that is a subsidiary of the Economic Times: From the desk of the editor:</p>
<p>ROOTS OF CONSPIRACY<br />
After years of biological research in producing organic synthesis of human organs, a secret research groups has published a paper discussion the success of synthetic human organ production from generative DNA manipulation. The secret Wuhan Laboratory details a process that is described as:</p>
<p>OPERATIONAL COMPONENTS OF CONSPIRACY<br />
Using high powered space-based multi-spectral lasers with phased pulsing emitters of significant power outputs (above 10KW). The power is PV array as a charged bank (Soros corporate logos are visible on the outside of the observed satellite) which is reflected coherently on a mirrors mounted at pizza parlors across the United States.</p>
<p>The source emission is then columnated by an array of Italian satellites in the final phase of the input energy to the fabrication process. After the columnated beam is focused, the beam(s) pass through a slotted series of containment vessels onto an organic plasma which is excited and emits gases that are ionized and passed to connected vapor deposition vessel that holds human DNA stems cells.</p>
<p>CONSPIRATORIAL OBJECTIVE/RESULT<br />
The DNA affected by the deposition process mutated by the prescribed masking prior to the deposition. The resulting DNA produces pre-viable fetuses with a genetic disposition described as paederast and a proclivity to enjoin republican causes, with a noticeable genetic mark&#8211;no facial features. This is known, not believed, as this reporter is familiar with the text of the only book that needs reading (and the only book this reporter reads).</p>
<p>PRESS RELEASES AND PUBLICATIONS<br />
TBD</p>

				<p>How fraudsters exploited our fears during the &#8216;scamdemic&#8217;<br />
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210611-how-fraudsters-exploited-our-fears-during-the-pandemic" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210611-how-fraudsters-exploited-our-fears-during-the-pandemic</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The field of psychology is now catching up with this problem, with various studies analyzing the contents of these attacks to reveal some simple rules of deception.</p>
<p>The first is superficial: they&#8217;ll try to use some familiar elements – like the name or logo of a famous brand – to gain your immediate trust. Most scams will then try to elicit a strong ==&gt;emotional response that stops us thinking logically. That might be the promise of an immediate reward, or a potential threat. (As I found, scam artists can get meta – warning you of an impending fraud that needs immediate action, accessible only with your bank details.</p>
<p>In some of the most dastardly schemes, fraudsters pretend to be a lawyer or doctor, representing a family member or colleague in need of urgent financial help. &#8220;Often negative emotions are most effective,&#8221; says Cleotilde Gonzalez, a professor of decision science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Thirdly, most scams present a &#8220;time limited&#8221; situation that demands an immediate response.  This is essential, since it ==&gt;increases the chance that you will act before you engage your critical thinking skills. You are in such a rush not to miss the opportunity, that you forget the possibility of deceit.</p>
<p>Many scams involve a potent mix of all three factors. Consider the calls purporting to be from a local tax authority or national crime agency, warning that you will face a fine or court action unless action is taken urgently (which usually involves handing over bank account details).<br />
==&gt;Faced with that immediate threat, it&#8217;s very hard to think clearly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your guard automatically drops in those situations, and your emotions will override rational decision making,&#8221; says Gareth Norris, a psychologist at Aberystwyth University in the UK, who recently reviewed the scientific research on phishing for the Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology.</p>
<p>Worryingly, our smartphones may have made us even more vulnerable to these attacks. For one thing, the screens are smaller, making it harder for us to scrutinise the details. Secondly, we spend so much time communicating on our phones that we may be more likely ==&gt;to read and respond to a message, compared to emails arriving on a desktop PC, which are more likely to be ignored, at least initially.</p>
<p>[NB!!!]One researcher even went as far as to describe a &#8220;Pavlovian behavioral loop&#8221;, in which the sound of a new notification triggers a small mood boost followed by the itching desire to respond. And we are less likely to give something deep thought if it provokes a habitual behavior. Social media like Facebook seem to raise particular risks, with phishers enjoying a much higher hit rate – perhaps because they can glean more information to personalize their messages, and because we are so keen to build our friendship group. Quite simply, the more you use a particular social network, the more likely you are to fall for a scam on that app.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, we often use our smart phones when we&#8217;re ==&gt;feeling distracted – either because we&#8217;re on the go, responding to someone else, or consuming media. It&#8217;s not uncommon to scroll through our phones while we are on the bus, watching a film or even talking to a friend, after all, and we often switch between apps and tasks, without really focusing on what we&#8217;re<br />
doing.</p>
<p>Thanks to the lockdowns and lack of contact with our friends and family, many people have been feeling a mix of uncomfortable emotions that make rational thought more difficult. Fear, for example, has been shown to muddy our ability to make decisions.</p>
<p>Our low mood and loneliness might have also rendered us vulnerable to many other schemes that appear to be only tangentially related to the pandemic.</p>
<p>While there are no fool-proof ways of protecting ourselves, Norris and Gonzalez both suggest that we should start by weaning ourselves off the habit of responding immediately to every message we receive. &#8220;Just give yourself time and think, is this real?&#8221; says Norris. And if there is a link within the message, we should type it out manually, rather than automatically clicking. That will help us to spot any anomalies in the URL.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we need to have constant vigilance – and to remember that the scammers will always be one step ahead of us with a new ingenious scheme.&#8221;</p>

<p>Turn off all notifications. You’ll feel better. If it’s urgent, they’ll call.</p>

				<blockquote><p>Snowden’s new blog: <a href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with most of section two of Snowden&#8217;s first essay. I disagree with the bit where he goes off like an American libertarian wingnut on &#8220;free speech&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Act and Equality Act work in tandem. They stop one person using their rights as a bully stick to infringe on another persons rights. They stop hate speech and other discrimination. These laws bring into force obligations under the European Convention which itself is a legal container for UN human rights obligations. I suggest Snowden read up on this before running his mouth off again.</p>
<p>Substack is well known for platforming hate speech. No thanks.</p>

				<p>@ vas pup,</p>
<blockquote><p>How fraudsters exploited our fears during the ‘scamdemic’</p></blockquote>
<p>First rule,</p>
<p>Do not put apps on your phone, so many do an ET and &#8220;Phone Home to the Mothership&#8221; you can not trust any of them especially in Google or Apples &#8220;Walled Gardens&#8221;. Which people realy should realise by now are nothing what so ever about your safety or security, but everything about tying you into their revenue streams&#8230; The scammers know this which is why they always try to get their crud into the walled gardens the unwise foolishly trust&#8230;</p>
<p>Second rule,</p>
<p>Do not have personal email it&#8217;s a major time sink for little or no return. Also any email that comes in on your work email that is &#8220;personal&#8221; just deleat immediately. If it&#8217;s from your boss or other work person and they face to face you over why you did not respond say,</p>
<p>Staff training says personal use of work resources is not alowed and that it&#8217;s probably a &#8220;phishing attempt&#8221; so I deleted it immediately. If they get arm wavery say you know my desk phone extention phone ne and tell me it is from you. Or better yet &#8220;OK I&#8217;ll phone your number to get confirmation and wait untill I get it before actioning the email&#8221;. It robs them of &#8220;fire and forget&#8221; mode of operating which tends to stop those awful &#8220;group Emails&#8221;.</p>
<p>If they get insistant about having your personal email details, tell them you don&#8217;t have one. If they get upperty say tou do not have personal Internet at home for security rrasons (true in my case). If pushed use one of those free services with random difficult to remember user names where emails get deleted automatically in 24hours. Tell them that they need to tell you personall if they have sent an Email as you very rarely if ever look and they get auto deleted in 24hours.</p>
<p>I genuinely do not have personal Email nor home internet and have not done so for many years. The last email account I had was a GMail account I&#8217;d set up back in last century when Google were experimenting with voice calls I accesed it from either the &#8220;social alowed computer&#8221; at work in the common area or via low cost dial up (anyone else remember that?). People moaned I&#8217;d say &#8220;waste of my time you pay for it if it&#8217;s that important to you&#8221; they never pay so I don&#8217;t play. Life is quieter that way, as they do actually tell me face to face if it&#8217;s important or send me a letter&#8230;</p>
<p>If I wanted to use it I do have Email by &#8220;WinLink&#8221; over HF radio based system using a PACTOR modem that I can access, it&#8217;s the same as &#8220;day boat sailors&#8221; use but without the eye watering fees[1].</p>
<p>There are also APRS gateways and now similar for JS8Call.</p>
<p>They are all very low bandwidth so no graphics, attachments or anything other than 7bit ASCII (or less). So of zero use to a scammer.</p>
<p>But you can use them just about any where on earth and off if you can see the ISS or certain satellites (no I&#8217;m to old to put the effort in to be an astronaut, I&#8217;ll stick to designing &#8220;payloads&#8221;).</p>
<p>If you know some simple basics you can pirate some early generation US Navy transponder satelites quite securely likewise a number of geostationary satellite transponders. There are various South American drug-lords doing this currently and you can &#8220;tune in and listen&#8221; ifvyou want to[2].</p>
<p>Third Rule,</p>
<p>Never ever give your personal mobile phone number (if you have one) to anyone at work EVER or any other Personal number or contact detail to any organisation such as tour Dr, Dentist etc. Go buy a scrapper if they get insistant with one of those SMS only SIMS if you can. If not turn on VM and then leave the phone at home like we used to once do with &#8220;answer phones&#8221; or turn the phone off before you leave the house and during work hours. Only ever access the VM by phoning in from another &#8220;land line&#8221; number with caller ID blocking (if you can make it a premium rate dialback so much the better) don&#8217;t speak at all whilst accessing the VM use the touch tone pad only.</p>
<p>There are now &#8220;fun systems&#8221; that alow you to make the number you call from look like a number from abroad or similar. If they call back from their number you called then it forwards it to the number you called from. Otherwise it gives them a bogus &#8220;call menu&#8221; system so they pay the premium rate forva few minutes (it&#8217;s a business idea that I wish I&#8217;d thought off 😉</p>
<p>Or setup a VoIP system that uses the most expensive of premium rate numbers for dial in, where you get a cut of the inbound call fees. If they want to call you, they might as well pay you, you can forward it to VM anyway.</p>
<p>There are several other tricks you can do. Back when &#8220;Asterix&#8221; was new a friend worked out how to make a new codec that added a long lag time, similar to that you get on international or satellite phones it made having your &#8220;call transfered&#8221; to a different time zone sound quite authentic thus sounding &#8220;tired and grumpy&#8221; acceptable when you say &#8220;Do you know what time it is in XXX?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes it&#8217;s social engineering but then that is what they are trying to do to you&#8230;</p>
<p>[1] <a href="http://www.hackingfamily.com/Jon/radio_email.htm" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.hackingfamily.com/Jon/radio_email.htm</a></p>
<p>[2] Whilst you can hear these Pirates,</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RyxheXG9APo" rel="nofollow ugc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RyxheXG9APo</a></p>
<p>The us of certain &#8220;Spread Spectrum&#8221; techniques with wider bandwidth transponders gives not just privacy it is no where nearcas noticable to the genuine owner/operators of such transpnders as you effectively just &#8220;raise the grass&#8221; slightly and don&#8217;t noticably interfere with them.</p>
<p>Similar techniques used in early &#8220;White Space&#8221; systems alowed you to hide under terestrial analogue TV transmitters and if you used low data rates, below FM Broadcasters including the traditional illegal &#8220;Pirate Radio Stations&#8221;&#8230; Which presents a some what ironic situation.</p>

				<p>Attempting to overthrow the government, stopping one branch from carrying out its obligation to proclaim the duly elected person to the office of President (wait, that sounds like means, motive, and opportunity) by the current office holder? Oh, it&#8217;s probably just a conflict of interest or some misunderstanding, right?</p>
<p>A group, lightly armed, a paramilitary force, attempts (which was planned by the former National Security Advisor and U.S. general that had given a speech the night before to pump up the crowd) to forcibly overthrow the government, you have grade A TREASON on your hands. Well, the condition that existed then persists today. Does anyone see a problem here? This rolls up two different political criminal concepts, terrorism and sedition. January sixth was the terrorist acts, and the treasonous behavior. The plotting and preparing for another act of treason using the tools of terrorism and sedition is ongoing&#8230;</p>
<p>The ironic thing is what someone had continued to say on the campaign, signaling from the White House lawn on the last day of the RNC event in 2020&#8211;with Kool-Aid served to everyone.</p>

				<p>I tend to disagree with the American view on what constitutes terrorism and also disagree with the American view of what makes good law especially with regard to absolutism of constitutional rights where those clash with human rights. This makes the Office of the Director of National Intelligence position paper a bit of a contentious read. The House of Representatives committee hearing isn&#8217;t hugely problematic in itself but I think it loses some of the importance and urgency of the situation in its ponderous verbosity.</p>

<p>(PART II): ADEQUACY OF THE FEDERAL RESPONSE</p>
<p>=======================================================================</p>
<p>HEARING BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES OF THE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND REFORM</p>
<p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</p>
<p>ONE HUNDRED SIXTEENTH CONGRESS</p>
<p>FIRST SESSION</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>JUNE 4, 2019</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>Serial No. 116-32</p>
<p>International terrorists include members of designated foreign terrorist organizations&#8211;we call them FTOs&#8211;state sponsors of terrorism, and homegrown violent extremists, or HVEs. Domestic terrorists are individuals who commit violent criminal acts in furtherance of ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as bias, racial bias, and antigovernment sentiment.</p>
<p>Despite the many similarities, the FBI distinguishes domestic terrorism extremists from homegrown violent extremists in that the latter are global jihad inspired, while domestic terrorist inspiration emanates from domestic influence&#8211;influences like racial bias or antiauthority.</p>
<p>The FBI seeks to disrupt domestic terrorist actors by leveraging the full arsenal of investigative techniques. However, as this committee knows, no investigation can be opened based solely on the First Amendment protected activity. For example, the FBI does not investigate rallies or protests, unless there is a credible belief that violent criminal activity may be occurring.</p>
<p><b>The FBI assesses domestic terrorists collectively pose a persistent and evolving involving threat of violence and economic harm to the United States. In fact, there have been more arrests and deaths in the U.S. caused by domestic terrorists than international terrorists in recent years.</b></p>
<p>Individuals affiliated with racially motivated violent extremism are responsible for the most lethal and violent activity and are responsible for the majority of lethal attacks and fatalities perpetrated by domestic terrorists since 2000.</p>
<p>Racially motivated violent extremism includes threats deriving from bias related to race held by the actor against others or a given population group. The current RMV threat, as we call it, is decentralized and characterized by lone actors radicalized online who target minorities and soft targets using easily accessible weapons.</p>
<p>This assessment is in contrast to the FBI&#8217;s past assessments of similar movements in the 1980&#8217;s and the early 2000&#8217;s when the RMV threat was composed of hierarchy and structured groups, nationally organized groups led by charismatic ideologues.</p>
<p>In recent years, lone offenders have committed the most lethal domestic extremist violence. These offenders primarily use firearms and often act without specific guidance from a group. Radicalization of domestic terrorists primarily occurs through self-radicalization online, which can sometimes present mitigation difficulties. It is a challenge for law enforcement.</p>
<p>The internet and social media enables individuals to engage other domestic terrorists without face-to-face meetings.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen multiple devastating attacks committed by domestic terrorists in recent months, most recently in the U.S., these include the shootings at Chabad of Poway synagogue in Poway, California, and the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In 2018, domestic violent extremists conducted six lethal attacks, killing 17 victims. In 2017, domestic violent extremists conducted five lethal attacks, killing eight victims.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Hate crimes tear at the fabric of our communities and our country, so we must ensure the civil rights of all persons, which are guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, are protected. Hate crime laws in the United States are intended to protect our citizens against biased crimes, motivated by animus against a protected class of persons.</p>
<p>Current U.S. statutes permit Federal prosecution of hate crimes committed on the basis of a person&#8217;s race, religion, disability, ethnic or national origin, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity.</p>
<p>Over time, the FBI&#8217;s ability to investigate these crimes has expanded as new laws were passed. For example, the Civil Rights Act of 1968 permitted Federal prosecution of crimes committed with a bias against race, color, religion, or national origin.</p>
<p>In 2009, when the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act was passed, Federal hate crime law expanded to apply to crimes motivated by a victim&#8217;s gender, perceived gender, sexual orientation, or disability.</p>
<p><b>In order for the FBI to initiate a hate crimes investigation, there are three key elements we must look for or must suspect.</p>
<p>No. 1, there must be an act of violence, threatened violence, or conspiracy to do so.</p>
<p>No. 2, the perpetrator must have acted willfully or intentionally.</p>
<p>And, No. 3, the perpetrator&#8217;s actions must have been motivated by an actual or perceived statutorily recognized bias.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that hate crimes investigations are often, by their very nature, reactive. That being said, we in the FBI understand that we must also be proactive in trying to prevent hate crimes.</b></p>
<p>Because hate crimes and domestic terrorism can intersect, the FBI&#8217;s Counterterrorism Division also addresses hate crimes through domestic terrorism investigation. In some instances, we work parallel investigations. By analyzing and sharing intelligence, we both hope to prevent hate crime incidents. But if hate crime does occur, we work diligently to hold those responsible accountable for their actions and seek justice for victims.</p>
<p>Hate crimes are not only an attack on victims, but they often have a wide-ranging harmful impact on communities. Thus, investigating hate crimes is one of the FBI&#8217;s highest priorities.</p>
<p>Although the FBI is the primary U.S. law enforcement agency that conducts civil rights investigations, we understand the importance of partnerships with Federal, state, and local law enforcement, as well as affected communities. Community engagement, outreach, training, and education are critical to our success in addressing hate crimes.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><b>And now domestic terrorist movements are borrowing from the ISIS handbook, using social media to recruit, radicalize, inspire, and mobilize Americans to violence.</b></p>
<p>This latest evolution in terrorist threats occurs in relative isolation and involves a smaller window between radicalization and violent acts, and together these factors make it extremely difficult for law enforcement, including my partners at the FBI, to detect and thwart potential attacks.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><b>What is needed is true&#8211;a true whole-of-society approach. And, thankfully, a growing number of state and local jurisdictions are adopting a multidisciplinary threat management prevention strategy.</b></p>
<p>For the past several years, DHS has worked with law enforcement, academia, mental health professionals, educators, and faith leaders to develop prevention strategies. Through the CVE grant program, the National Governor&#8217;s Association is developing prevention strategies in Virginia, Colorado, Illinois, and Michigan.</p>
<p>Another grant is allowing the Major City Chiefs Association to develop a law enforcement implementation guide for prevention.</p>
<p>And last week I saw firsthand how DHS investments in prevention are yielding dividends.</p></blockquote>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm, D-503,</p>
<blockquote><p>I was referring to traditional aliens, not terrestrial based.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well I was being half serious.</p>
<p>Ask yourself the all important first question which is,</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you know an alien if you saw one anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>The odds are you would not for a couple of basic reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly it they are here the odds are that they have not turned up recently, but hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago. Our &#8220;memory records&#8221; only go back a few thousand years at most.</p>
<p>Thus if aliens are here we would not know they were aliens they would just be another of the very many life forms there are around.</p>
<p>Now the important &#8220;energy question&#8221; Einstein&#8217;s equation of the energy to mass and vice verser conversion tells of E=MC^2 tells us something. Basically moving matter over any distance needs a lot of energy even if the work (power) is spread out over time (Power is Energy against Time). The only advantage of moving very fast is that localised forces have a smaller effect on a body in motion.</p>
<p>So from most respects the Aliens would do best if very very small. And we do get Alien invaders every day by the billions we call them &#8220;photons&#8221; they effectively have zero mass and can move at about as close to the speed of light as you can. We are sending of &#8220;inteligence aliens&#8221; all the time by the use of coherant radiated photons mainly in the low frequency end of the EM spectrum. Just think how much energy gets radiated at 50 or 60Hz all the time.</p>
<p>I could go on to describe the four fundemental forces,</p>
<p>1, Gravity,<br />
2, Electromagnetic,<br />
3, Strong Nuclear,<br />
4, Weak Nuclear,</p>
<p>And how they effect all objects but to be honest only the first two are of interest in even human scale distances. Gravity works on mass so large mass objects like anything you can pick up right up to black holes get affected by it Newtons laws apply to objects in human scsle masses and speeds. However a photon which has effectively zero mass only gets minimally effected by gravity because of the relative speed it moves at (the maths gets a bit funky so so lets not do it).</p>
<p>French physicist Charles Coulomb described the force of electrically charged objects and in 1785 published his findings, and it has the same formular as gravity but with different constants. So it to has infinite reach and effect inversly proportional to the square of the distance between any two charges. Thirty four yers later Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted published that in his view electricity and magnetism were very much related and thus charge moving as an electric current created a magnetic field. Twenty years later Englishman Michael Faraday demonstrated that a moving magnetic field created a current and it had to wait untill the 1860s for Scotish mathmeticion and natural philosopher James Clark Maxwell to produce his funky equations of the fields interactions with each other. But not on how they effected charged particles, that little problem was cracked by Hendrik Lorentz in 1892 when the Dutchnsn calculated the resultant force on a charged particle in an electromagnetic field. But are photons charged particles?</p>
<p>Well&#8230; According to Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) it&#8217;s complicated&#8230; That is photons transmit electromagnetic force both macroscopically and microscopically and we also get into the are they a particle, force or both&#8230;</p>
<p>But it was not untill the 1950&#8242; we kind of worked that forces have associated particles now called &#8220;guage particles&#8221; that in effect transmit the force effects between other particals. The photon is the electromagnetic guage partical, as for gravity we hypothesized the graviton for gravity and British theoretical physist Peter Higgs along with four others propposed back in 1964 a partical for mass. We now call it the Higgs Boson and it&#8217;s an elementary particle in the current SI model. which we may or may not have found back in 2012, people are still crunching the dat 😉</p>
<p>The practical upshot on the macro scale is that photons can be thought of as particles with minimal or non existant charge and no mass. Thus the photons are minimally effected by either Gravity or Electromagnetic forces means we can see back relatively clearly for several billion years with them. Whilst they diverge they in effect remain cohearent, which is what you want for transmitting information. Especially as you &#8220;fire and forget&#8221; that is all the energy goes in at the launch site and off they go, they either keep going in more or less a straight line or they &#8220;hit something&#8221; either reflecting or being absorbed and giving up the energy they carry and any information that is impressed on it. The down side is they &#8220;radiate&#8221; which means that the resulting electromagnetic fields get spread out over the surface of an ever expanding sphere, so the energy drops as 1/(r^2) which is actually rather fast all things considered. Eventially they can not be detected above background noise that they become part of.</p>
<p>But what of something more solid more life like than a photon?</p>
<p>Well science fiction talks of &#8220;seed ships&#8221; and &#8220;self replicating robots&#8221;. Science does not realy differentiate between biological or mechanical self replicating objects it just comes up with figures.</p>
<p>Well arguably again you want the smalest size possible and for the self replicant to be able to remain dormant for indeterminate but very long periods of time.</p>
<p>There are several chemicals that will be produced by the actions of electromagnetic forces and surprise suprise they can be used for the building blocks of organic life&#8230;</p>
<p>If you sprayed self replicating chemicals into space you could get them to spread wildly and with little energy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why some think we may be the result of some such chemical hitting the earth a few billion years back. And as they say &#8220;it all followed on&#8221; so we very well could be part of a continuing alien invasion by designed self replicating chemicals, or maybe they just came about due to a lucky lightning strike&#8230;</p>
<p>But if we were such alien invaders we would have bo real way of knowing it, unless a large amount of information followed up to tell us.</p>
<p>Hence you get back to phorons or gravitons again, and we know we are gettjng bombarded by photons all the time..</p>
<p>It would be the &#8220;minimal cost, maximum spread&#8221; option if the speed of light can not be exceeded and so far we have good reason to believe not. Because things get way more than funky if you can&#8230;</p>

				<p><strong></p>
<p>If autism is just a difference, then what are the problems that neurotypicals face as individuals that autistic people do not struggle with, and not how they act towards autistic people?<br />
Originally Answered: What are a list of problems neurotypicals face that autistic people don’t?</p>
<p>In my opinion, Neurotypicals suffer from what I’ll call Masking Dependency Syndrome. MDS sufferers are on a spectrum, just like ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder). Symptoms of MDS include:</p>
<p><code>Susceptibility to Peer Pressure (SPP). This first manifests in early childhood but becomes a serious problem as MDS sufferers enter puberty. Giving into Peer Pressure of ANY kind is a sign of MDS, but in its most extreme form, NTs abandon their moral code for social acceptance. Smoking, drinking, drugs, driving while intoxicated and bullying are all symptoms of an NT struggling with SPP.</p>
<p>But, SPP doesn’t begin in nor end with puberty. You can see it in extremely young children who abandon their play-style to mimic the play-style of others in an attempt to belong to the group. And you can see it in adults who pursue careers they have no interest in or passion for simply because it is “what society tells them is valuable.” From the Autistic point of view, these people lack autonomy. They’re the second-and-third-tier popular kids in high school and college, conforming to the wills and whims of the sociopaths who run the “popular clique.” They’re the middle managers who do things they know are morally wrong but don’t want to anger their boss. They’re the people who get “squeezed in the middle,” often uncomfortable with what they’ve been asked to do but unable to resist doing it.<br />
Subconsciously Generated Masking. Unless it is made explicitly clear to these people, they are unaware that they consistently wear a mask. They spend more time trying to look good than be good. In its most toxic form, this is how someone convinces themselves that they’re a good and decent human being while doing absolutely terrible things; a priest who molests children, a police officer who harasses citizens, a politician who takes bribes. One can argue that these are all sociopathic traits. That’s true! But, they are not exclusively sociopathic. And because NTs lack the self awareness to see themselves accurately, they don’t understand how they all appear somewhat sociopathic to ASD members. (Ya’ll a little dangerously cray-cray from my point of view!)<br />
Emotional Thinking. NTs value emotions above logic. And, without education, NTs do not naturally identify fallacies of logic. They are highly susceptible to Group Think and Propaganda. This is why advertising techniques work on them but not on ASD members.</p>
<p>There are exceptions; NTs who go into the sciences or study math tend to be more logical (but never as logical as an ASD member.) NTs can be trained to be more logical. If an NT joins a Speech and Debate team, studies law, goes into a career in physics then they tend to think more rationally and logically. But, from my personal experience, they need rigorous training and must always be vigilant about their tendencies to “feel” rather than “think.” As a whole, they resist statistical thinking, they resist fact-based assessments, they tend to rely on the opinions of experts (which is a logical fallacy) and they struggle with paradigm-shifts (which is why they resist adopting new technology and need marketing manipulation in order to adopt something that is in their best interest.)</p>
<p>As always, this is a spectrum and there are exceptions. An NT who naturally thinks logically is, for their part of the MDS spectrum, a genius who should be celebrated for overcoming the disabilities so prevalent in their part of the species.</p>
<p>4: Because there are so many on the MDS spectrum (approximately 98% of the human race) they do not perceive their mental disability as a disability. They tend to dismiss it as “the human condition.” When MDS derails their lives, they often say “Well, that’s just the human condition.” It isn’t the human condition. It’s their condition. The Fallacy of Large Numbers blinds them into thinking their way is the only way and our way is the defective way.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this is only my observation. And I don’t speak for all Autistic people. I’m an Aspie or “High Functioning” Autistic Person (a stunningly offensive term. We really do need to give ourselves a better label.) My experience is dramatically different than someone who is a Non-Verbal Autistic Person (and that’s assuming we actually belong on the same spectrum; it is NTs who lumped us all together. Currently, there is no genetic basis for lumping us together. It is only the NTs crude form of categorization that lumps us on the same spectrum. It’s a bit like saying hippos and elephants are big, grey and live in Africa so they must be part of the same species.)</p>
<p>But, let’s assume that my personal observations are grounded in provable facts. What does all this mean?</p>
<p>It means that the ASD brain “evolved” to favor accurate heuristics at the expense of social skills and it means the MDS brain “evolved” to favor social skills at the expense of accurate heuristics. So, which is better than the other? Neither. It depends, mostly on what the individual is trying to solve.</p>
<p>If you need to survive and procreate in an ancient world of dangerous predators, then MDS is preferred. If you want to put a human on the moon or solve climate change or build computers, ASD is superior.</p>
<p>MDS is prone to racism, sexism, “hatred of the other,” group think and a struggle with perceiving complicated, science-based systems because the heuristics of MDS are faulty.</p>
<p>ASD is prone to social isolation, at least in an MDS-dominant culture. But, as society became technologically advanced, ASD members were better suited to cope, adapt and thrive.</p>
<p>We all walk around with super computers that fit into our pockets. We could all use them to teach ourselves to code. We all have access to vast amounts of knowledge on Wikipedia, YouTube and the Web. Most of the world has inexpensive Maker Spaces which enable people to quickly teach themselves a wide variety of advanced technical skills.</p>
<p>And yet, most people use their super computer to surf Instagram, they don’t watch educational videos on YouTube, they don’t default to “let me google that” when asked a question they don’t know, they don’t self-teach, they aren’t skilling up for 50 bucks a month at a Makerspace, they are living their 19th century life with 21st century tech in their pocket.</p>
<p>That’s an NT. That’s not an ASD member. From our point of view, NTs are cavemen. And now that the modern world has given us a way to out-earn NT members, we can more easily meet mates and procreate. Like it or not, we’re the future of the human race. Right now, we’re 2%. Give us another 50 years and we’ll be 3–4%. Give us a century and we’ll be 8%. And then, even though we’ll still be a minority, we will be able to fight for our civil rights and make it very, very clear to NTs that we are just as valid a branch of the human race.</p>
<p>The ultimate irony of this? NTs do not like the world they’ve created. They hate the sociopathic nature of corporations, they complain about corrupt governments, they rail against racism and they rally for gender equality. They hate every aspect of the world we live in…but they fail to recognize they created this world, not those of us on the Autistic Spectrum. This world represents the very best of what an NT mind is capable of. And it sucks. And they know it. But, they can’t think of better because they can’t do better.</p>
<p>In the meantime, NTs will continue to blithely delude themselves into thinking we’re the broken ones, we lack executive function, we’re damaged and when they screw up it is merely “the human condition.” Sigh.<br />

				<p>The argument is that &#8220;white&#8221; people are overrepresented in positions of power.</p>
<p>Yet it&#8217;s taboo to mention the overrepresentation of Jewish people in the higher echelons of society and corporations which is where the oppression is coming from. It&#8217;s rarely mentioned that Sephardic Jews from Amsterdam had a significant role in the transatlantic slave trade, if not the leading role, which black carribean professor Tony Martin has researched and discussed:</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH9GESHJpI" rel="nofollow ugc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH9GESHJpI</a></p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g5SsGfZubKA" rel="nofollow ugc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g5SsGfZubKA</a></p>
<p>Oddly enough, modern capitalism started in the exact same context: in Amsterdam, with the VOC (first multinational corporation), and these colonizers created the multicultural societies of today by displacing people all over the world, which is why in Dutch colonies like Suriname you have Indian people from the subcontinent, people of African descent etc. The VOC would literally sail around the globe and at every point pick people up and drop them off at the next colony.</p>
<p>So this was the pandoras box that created modern racism and racial tension and inequality in the first place &#8212; there was never such a comprehensive forced mass displacement of people before this, and it&#8217;s the reason for the racial makeup of countries like Brazil and much of the Carribean.</p>
<p>So you would think that if people truly wanted to get to the root of racial inequality and racism they would look honestly at these crucial historical facts. The complete avoidance of true historical fact by the narrative promoters should tell you all you need to know about the agenda.</p>
<p>Now the next step is to look at any current racist colonizing happening in the world today, where it&#8217;s happening and who is doing the racist apartheid and oppression of indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>That colonizing and displacement of people and racist oppression is clearly happening in Palestine today, and the perpetrators aren&#8217;t &#8220;white&#8221; Christians, yet this very real ethnonationalist racist apartheid is happening right now and it is ignored by the same race theory pushers. It&#8217;s obviously the logical conclusion for people opposed to racism and race based oppression to find solidarity with the Palestinian people, and yet any time BLM groups or others have tried to make that connection they have been shut down, and the BDS movement is being censored and attacked.</p>
<p>So this same race theory tries to paint these racist colonizers as victims while pinning the blame solely on under melanated people who have a pale skin tone, based on the colour of skin</p>
<p>There are some truths in this theory, mixed with lies and distortions and bigotry to muddy the waters. But it&#8217;s the historical record that they purposefully ignore which is what you need to look into.</p>

				<p>@ White Power:</p>
<p>Critical Race Theory was conjured up by the elite in order to focus our eyes on race (create a race war) so that we don’t focus our eyes on them (and create a class war).</p>
<p>The elite are aware of the massive inequality they have created, but that is the last thing they want you focusing on, so they have engineered a race war: put the blame on whitey for causing inequality. They are giving to blacks while holding their noses, and the blacks are running with it.</p>
<p>The elite have control of the media (social, print, TV) and they have framed the narrative this way. They are censoring everything through their filters, twisting and rewriting history, destroying the country in order to save themselves.</p>

&#8220;Thus if aliens are here we would not know they were aliens they would just be another of the very many life forms there are around.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have heard two stories of where aliens live on earth.<br />
Based on a few assumptions:<br />
1) Aliens are disguised as humans, trying to look as humans, but not quite succeeding<br />
2) They use an incomprehensible language<br />
3) They are rich<br />
4) They are not attacked in war</p>
<p>Best choices for putatively aliens:<br />
1) The Swiss<br />
2) The Japanese (the war thing is a weakness here)</p>

<p>Not at all, you&#8217;re just arrogant and narcissistic and think you understand every aspect of the universe despite still not even discovering most of our own ocean.</p>
<p>You have literally zero possible methods in disproving or proving my stances as they are mutually discussed between scientific and religiously scientific communities as plausible theory and maintain relevancy as such.</p>
<p>In fact ID, is in my experience, a perfect meeting place between the scientific method and religion when discussed objectively.</p>
<p>What you seem to be coming from are the types of indoctrination where people misuse the phrase “Believe in the science” as an equation to “obey their authority”</p>
<p>Ironically, science is a process, not an authority, and its entirely part of the scientific method to create “Theory” and also be completely wrong as well.</p>
<p>Science is and never will be, an authority.</p>
<p>Indoctrinated types like yourselves aren&#8217;t taught that it’s a process, instead you are led to think that science is a counsel of bishops (peer review) and authority (government led) when in fact science is open source to any and all experts or PhD involved within a given field of study.</p>
<p>Many times credible theories and scientists are often dismissed because they are not funded or sponsored by the government to create the science the government wants as a means implement laws that are nonsense. See: 36 genders, men have periods, hcq was ineffective, etc etc.</p>

				<p>Is there another country on this planet where fossils such as Pelosi, Schumer, McConnel et al are allowed to marinate in office for so long? Besides the former Soviet Union and places like North Korea. Why do we put up with this gerontocracy of decomposing corpses, their trembling hands unsteadily but desperately clinging to the reins of power? See also Maxine Waters, Dianne Feinstein, Bill Pascrell, Grace Napolitano, Alcee Hastings, Pat Roberts, Eddie Bernice Johnson, Jim Inhofe, Chuck Grassley, Don Young , Richard Shelby (all in their 80’s) both presidential candidates of the Officially Allowed Parties from 2020, etc etc. It’s called retirement; it’s neither a new nor a difficult concept.</p>
<p>But if I was drying out the American utters for the last century (some of them look like the crypt keeper), I wouldn’t leave until they carried my remnants out of Washington DC. What other profession can you turn a 6 figure salary into a 9 figure net worth? Good work it you can get it as they say.</p>

				<p>I’m sick and tired of all the bullshit. I’m tired of a select few running this country / world and deciding the narrative. I’m fed up with money being what drives everything in this world. I’m done with letting the elite and government run my life and tell me how to live and try to punish me if I don’t live that way. I’m just done with all of it.</p>
<p>The problem with &#8220;money&#8221; is that all of it is borrowed from central banks at interest. So, while GDP should be in indicator of relative productivity, what it ACTUALLY is, is a measure of how much debt each country owes.</p>
<p>The national debt can NEVER be paid off, regardless of how productive the country is. It&#8217;s mathematically impossible, due to the fact that all of the interest payments must also be borrowed from the central bank at interest.</p>

				<p>I have a serious question that I&#8217;ve been trying to find the answer to on my own but can&#8217;t quite get it. Why is it that we even used mRNA to be used in these vaccines? Why didn&#8217;t we just make the vaccine like all other vaccines are made? With inactive virus material to expose and stimulate the immune system? Why even mess with this mRNA stuff instead of going with what we already know? These questions really worry me. If someone could please explain it , I&#8217;d really appreciate it. I don&#8217;t understand enough on my own I guess and trying to research it I just can&#8217;t get a definitive answer on the why we chose to mess with mRNA in first place and to use the lipid nanoparticles which I have heard are seeming to concern some in CDC and other doctors professionals. I was actually about to link the source for that and I see now that it has been deleted. So&#8230; Please. Can someone just explain that part to me. Why we didn&#8217;t just make a vaccine the way we&#8217;ve made previous vaccines?</p>

				<p>&#8220;They&#8221; will tell you that one can develop mRNA vaccines quickly and it wasn&#8217;t until &#8220;recently&#8221; that they figured out you to get it into your cells.</p>
<p>But I think you&#8217;re right with what you&#8217;re implying/getting at: Why use a vaccine technology that has never been used at this sort of scale before? Especially for one that has a relatively high survival rate? I mean if we were dealing with something on the level of smallpox, polio, etc. maybe I could see the justification. Personally, I would have only offered mRNA to older folks as they were the ones at risk and wait for a standard vax for everyone else.</p>
<p>Not to mention Australia who has so much capital and resources, large Health care governance and institutions is dragging their feet so hard on the vax&#8217;s its now become obvious it wasn&#8217;t out of incompetence but a decent decision for its population, until last week only people aged 60+ were allowed it and now only 50+ are allowed to get the jab.</p>
<p>They could have bought 20mil doses months ago, I see now why they didn&#8217;t.</p>

I've been writing about security issues on my <a href="/">blog</a> since 2004, and in my monthly <a href="/crypto-gram/">newsletter</a> since 1998. I'm a fellow and lecturer at Harvard's <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/bruce-schneier">Kennedy School</a>, a board member of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and the Chief of Security Architecture at <a href="https://inrupt.com/">Inrupt, Inc.</a> This personal website expresses the opinions of none of those organizations.</p>
