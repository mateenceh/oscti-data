		<h2 class="entry">Information Flows and Democracy</h2>
		<p>Henry Farrell and I published a paper on fixing American democracy: &#8220;<a href="https://snfagora.jhu.edu/publication/rechanneling-beliefs/">Rechanneling Beliefs: How Information Flows Hinder or Help Democracy</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s much easier for democratic stability to break down than most people realize, but this doesn&#8217;t mean we must despair over the future. It&#8217;s possible, though very difficult, to back away from our current situation towards one of greater democratic stability. This wouldn&#8217;t entail a restoration of a previous status quo. Instead, it would recognize that the status quo was less stable than it seemed, and a major source of the tensions that have started to unravel it. What we need is a dynamic stability, one that incorporates new forces into American democracy rather than trying to deny or quash them.</p>
<p>This paper is our attempt to explain what this might mean in practice. We start by analyzing the problem and explaining more precisely why a breakdown in public consensus harms democracy. We then look at how these beliefs are being undermined by three feedback loops, in which anti-democratic actions and anti-democratic beliefs feed on each other. Finally, we explain how these feedback loops might be redirected so as to sustain democracy rather than undermining it.</p>
<p>To be clear: redirecting these and other energies in more constructive ways presents enormous challenges, and any plausible success will at best be untidy and provisional. But, almost by definition, that&#8217;s true of any successful democratic reforms where people of different beliefs and values need to figure out how to coexist. Even when it&#8217;s working well, democracy is messy. Solutions to democratic breakdowns are going to be messy as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is part of our series of papers looking at democracy as an information system. The first paper was &#8220;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3273111">Common-Knowledge Attacks on Democracy</a>.&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;It’s much easier for democratic stability to break down than most people realize, but this doesn’t mean we must despair over the future. &#8221;</p>
<p>I do not see this as being about information flows.</p>
<p>One cause of the current situation is generally acknowledged to be the rampant rising inequality in the USA and elsewhere, and the feeling the next generation will be worse of. Just today there were reports of the USA billionaires dodging income taxes.</p>
<p>On the other side, Americans are fast to let &#8220;losers&#8221; fall beside the wayside. See the rust belts and the coal country. And this happens everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>If people feels others are not doing their part in keeping the country running, or that they are being left behind to fend for themselves many will decide to opt out of the current system.</p>

				<p>This is related to some observations by C Wright Mills about the managerialization of society.</p>
<p>In his view, the US was a &#8220;society of publics&#8221; in the late 1800&#8217;s, when most economic activity was characterized by an &#8220;anarchy of production.&#8221;  In this &#8220;society of publics&#8221; newspapers proliferated and individuals shared information back and forth.</p>
<p>Beginning in the late 1800&#8217;s and early 1900&#8217;s, the US transformed into a &#8220;society of masses&#8221; where information flows only one way: at people.  Simultaneously, the rise of industrial management techniques fundamentally changed the way business was conducted.</p>
<p>Today, this tend is intensified.  In the 1990&#8217;s, Clinton&#8217;s FCC changed media consolidation rules, newspapers slimmed down and closed foreign bureaus, and after 2000, newspaper revenue plummeted further due to lost classified ad revenue.</p>
<p>So we now have a handful of foreign journalists writing for a handful of wire services, and these reports get refashioned for local papers, and then reiterated by bloggers who think they have their own opinion about what&#8217;s going on in the world.</p>

				<p>My apprehension is that any effort to &#8220;rechannel information flow&#8221;, especially a concerted effort by a domestic government, can or inevitably will lead to illiberal outcomes.</p>
<p>America is a country in which the same organizations run for office manage the election process (unlike essentially any other modern democracy). The outcome of this process is non-partisan use of gerrymandering, voter suppression laws, homestating, influence of primary processes, etc.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to understand how domestic information flows can be rechanneled without affecting America&#8217;s arguably already substantially decayed domestic liberal society.</p>

				<p>Partisan tripe. We know accounting works, but people don&#8217;t trust accounting because it works, they trust it because of audits by independent third parties. Elections could be trusted under similar regimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Specifically, the ambitions of Republican politicians need to be redirected to reinforce democratic institutions rather than undermining them.&#8221; &#8211; are you even aware of democrats doing EXACTLY what republicans did in 2004 (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/01/06/electoral.vote.1718/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/01/06/electoral.vote.1718/</a>)?</p>
<p>I have to say I continue to be disappointed by this blog, since you have gone to harvard, the quality declined and the partisanship has increased. It would do you some good to get out of the group think.</p>

&#8220;they trust it because of audits by independent third parties. Elections could be trusted under similar regimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, there were international independent observers during the 2020 elections. They found the elections were fair and they criticized Trump for his baseless accusations.</p>

<p>However, since 2016 we cannot expect him to present an unbiased political commentary.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t look to Bruce anymore for opinions. They&#8217;re a bit too Atlantic Council for me deleting my comment addressing Pentagon policy and the military capability, legal, and discrimination issues was one deletion I will never tolerate or forgive.</p>
<p>The papers themselves are okay but nothing I haven&#8217;t read before in one form or another or haven&#8217;t figured out for myself. I disagree with their language as it feeds into a masculine technochratic approach I disagree with.</p>
<p>There is a currently an intense far right attack on human rights ongoing in the UK funded by the US far right. It&#8217;s attacking key NGO&#8217;s, governance, and infrastructure, and media. The first paper touches on this kind of thing. The second paper kind of misses the information flow issue because it involves controlling and deleting the message flow. This is why these attacks have been crafted as they have. A number of judicial reviews have been mounted on both sides. So far they are losing in court but the intensity of court action is going up a few notches. You would think government would step in. In the EU this is indeed happening but in the UK? The government is positively enabling it.</p>
<p>While the UK lacks a modern written historically there have been the three pillars of the judiciary, government, and public. These exist in a tug of war. Historically parliament has been pluralistic but over time and increasingly so in modern times become more and more narrow. With regard to this and Council of Ministers resolutions (including binding and none binding) and European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence the issue of human rights and  managing disruption caused by the integration of human rights issues is fairly clearly mapped out. There&#8217;s no major problem here as it can be regarded as settled law. And this is why an out of control UK government is so problematic in the UK.</p>
<p>The rot is so bad even The Atlantic has been captured with an extremely worrying puff piece on Johnson and an attack piece on Sturgeon. They could have been written by Tufton Street and the Heritage Foundation they were that bad. I&#8217;m not going to spend hours writing up a &#8220;Fisking&#8221; of either article but can categorically say to the point that I would swear under oath both pieces are based on a pack of lies and misdirection. It is the shabbiest of shabby journalism.</p>
<p>If Biden wants to experiment with feedback loops he could get the Equality Act passed and then lecture Johnson not only on his breaching of the NI agreement but also UK government attempts to evade the ICC and undermine the Brexit agreement with the EU with respect to dismantling human rights for ideological and trade profitability reasons.</p>

				<p>There are lots of problems undermining democracy.  We have government lying, such as Vietnam, Iraq 2 and recently, the (not) wearing of masks, and a corporate media in lock stop with the government. Currently the media disinformation concerns the source of the pandemic, which is a jump ball, but which the media still identifies the lab leak hypothesis as &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; theory.  The media is misleading about the deficits through omission.  Yes, the government is &#8220;borrowing&#8221; but who are they borrowing from?  They&#8217;re borrowing from the federal reserve, who prints the money and &#8220;lends&#8221; it to the government. It is nothing but a charade. I&#8217;m seeing reports on the resulting housing bubble that identifies all sources except the source causing the bubble, which is a lender at 0% interest because that lender can print the money.</p>
<p>So, with a useless media that omits and obfuscates, we&#8217;re wondering why Qanon gets legs?</p>
<p>And then lets look at the Republican party.  Since 1965, after the passing of the Civil Rights act, the GOP embarked on something called the &#8220;southern strategy&#8221;.  They started drawing these people in on cultural issues and saw them as useful idiots.  Well, they <em>are</em> the GOP now, and people like Romney and Liz Cheney are outliers. What did they chant at Trump rallies &#8211; lock her up?   And what did Putin do with Navalny &#8211; exactly that.  These people want a Putin.</p>
<p>And lets talk about a great admirer of the Confederacy, Adolf Hitler.  Hitler didn&#8217;t become dictator until the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act which said that anything Hitler wanted would be automatically approved by the Reichstag.<br />
What did the GOP 2020 platform say &#8211; well, they threw out all the principles they used to stand for, and it said &#8220;the Republican party has and will continue to enthusiastically support the President&#8217;s America-First agenda&#8221;, a sort of Enabling Act lite.</p>
<p>I think the notion that the GOP wants democracy needs to be thrown out the window. With a majority of the party now being the kinds of people recruited with the southern strategy, they do not.  We&#8217;re not seeing all these confederate flags by accident.</p>
<p>And one more point &#8211; Trump was trying to undermine the legitimacy of the 2016 elections with this birth certificate nonsense. I think the problem is a lot bigger than stated.</p>

				<p>Oh nice, a ready made thread&#8230;this ought be interesting.</p>
<p><b>9 June 2021 — How to Win Power and Influence People, Covertly</b><br />
Conspiracies surrounding the U.S. government, Hollywood celebrities, democrats, liberals, secularists, atheists, Muslims, Buddhists, and non-anglo peoples is based on the ahistorical tome &#8216;Turning Points in American Evangelicalism&#8217;. It is nearly compatible, to the letter, with the QaNoN movement in the United States and globally.</p>
<p>Interestingly the identified founder of a movement based on a charismatic preacher that shares more than a coincidental relationship with the religious right&#8217;s most active and dangerous groups begin in the middle of the 19th century. Of the contemporary revivalist type entities, The Family Research Council and a number of its ancillary groups such as National Legal Foundation, Congressional Pray Caucus Foundation, and over six other religious political action groups (super PACs) have more than a toehold on the conservative movement and the political apparatus the GOP. Identifying the sympathetic power elites that are bought and paid for by these groups is not difficult. Accounting for monetary support directly has some pitfalls…</p>
<p>The Family Research Council uses a scorecard to rank those in power as to their compliance with the agenda of the organization. Additionally, the funding that goes through these organizations is quite opaque. Religious 501(C3) organizations are not required to file tax reports to the IRS. Checks written to organizations such as the Catholic Church for example, never disclose sources of revenue and thus if the Catholic Church engages in political movements or programs then the Church essentially acts as a money laundering operation for those that want to exercise covert politics that is unaccountable. The only record tying activity related to political action is if an individual or corporation deducts the fund as a charitable contribution. And even then it is difficult to establish that the money did indeed provide some sort of political support.</p>
<p>One must recognize the clear alignment between the religious institutions that benefit from such tax policies and their benefactors. This is how the GOP has weaponized religion, indoctrinated the followers, and has set into motion a movement that is purely anti-democratic. This is not a conspiracy, this is essentially how the power dynamic operates at the local, state, and federal level and is poised to slash the throats of the non-believers. By non-believer, I am say those that are either in opposition or unwilling to participate in this theocratic autocracy that is the ultimate goal.</p>

				<p>In another Squid blog post, @Clive posted this:<br />
&#8220;In the US a tipping point had been crossed, life expectancy was going down, education levels were going down, living standards were going down and everything was being done on the cheap&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/06/friday-squid-blogging-squids-in-space.html/#comment-381117" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/06/friday-squid-blogging-squids-in-space.html/#comment-381117</a></p>
<p>The first three are each enough to explain the current attacks on democracy in the USA. Decreasing life expectancy, education and living standards ALWAYS lead to &#8220;disturbances&#8221;.</p>
