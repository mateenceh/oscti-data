		<h2 class="entry">Risks of Evidentiary Software</h2>
		<p>Over at Lawfare, Susan Landau has an <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/dangers-posed-evidentiary-softwareand-what-do-about-it">excellent essay</a> on the risks posed by  software used to collect evidence (a Breathalyzer is probably the most obvious example).</p>
<p>Bugs and vulnerabilities can lead to inaccurate evidence, but the proprietary nature of software makes it hard for defendants to examine it.</p>
<blockquote><p>The software engineers proposed a three-part test. First, the court should have access to the &#8220;Known Error Log,&#8221; which should be part of any professionally developed software project. Next the court should consider whether the evidence being presented could be materially affected by a software error. Ladkin and his co-authors noted that a chain of emails back and forth are unlikely to have such an error, but the <a href="https://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=3717">time</a> that a software tool logs when an application was used could easily be incorrect. Finally, the reliability experts recommended seeing whether the code adheres to an industry standard used in an non-computerized version of the task (e.g., bookkeepers always record every transaction, and thus so should  bookkeeping software).</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Inanimate objects have long served as evidence in courts of law: the door handle with a fingerprint, the glove found at a murder scene, the Breathalyzer result that shows a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit. But the last of those examples is substantively different from the other two. Data from a Breathalyzer is not the physical entity itself, but rather a software calculation of the level of alcohol in the breath of a potentially drunk driver. As long as the breath sample has been preserved, one can always go back and retest it on a different device.</p>
<p>What happens if the software makes an error and there is no sample to check or if the software itself produces the evidence? At the time of our writing the article on the use of software as evidence, there was no overriding requirement that law enforcement provide a defendant with the code so that they might examine it themselves.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Given the high rate of bugs in complex software systems, my colleagues and I concluded that when computer programs produce the evidence, courts cannot assume that the evidentiary software is reliable. Instead the prosecution must make the code available for an &#8220;adversarial audit&#8221; by the defendant&#8217;s experts. And to avoid problems in which the government doesn&#8217;t have the code, government procurement contracts must include delivery of source code­ &#8212; code that is more-or-less readable by people &#8212; ­for every version of the code or device. </p></blockquote>

				<p>When doing drug development or manufacturer, all instruments require independent calibration and proof that it was done.  Same for the scale at the deli counter or the meter at the filling station.</p>
<p>The problem with the breathalyzer or speed radar is not one of software.  It is one of will.  Apparently nobody cares enough to get it right.  Perhaps there is a preference to ask no questions.</p>
<p>But let’s not make the problem a technical one.  That obscures the real issue.</p>

				<p>@DV Henkel-Wallace</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure comparing the breathalizer to a deli scale is fair: State Departments of Commerce have Divisions of Weights and Measures to inspect things like sales and gas pumps.  States may mandate regular breathalizer calibration, but who inspects them?  Do we trust the police to fine the police for not checking to see whether the breathalizers are properly and regularly calibrated and also functioning correctly?</p>
<p>If no breath sample is retained &#8212; only the record of the software&#8217;s observation &#8212; how is the output of a breathalizer legally different from hearsay?  Because the breathalizer is technological?  Assuming it is more accurate that a human witness because it is technological creates big problems.</p>
<p>But I think the broader point is this: given the near-complete lack of software liability, the inscrutability of commercial code, and the dubious quality of most commercial software, a court of law &#8212; which seeks certainty &#8212; should not assume evidence that consists exclusively in the result of a software program is accurate prima facie.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a technical issue, but a legal issue caused by poor policy: software needs regulation, liability, and copyright reform.</p>

				<p>On top of all that, Bruce, the court should REQUIRE two things: first, records of at least the last three times the device has been calibrated, and secondly, a chain of custody.</p>
<p>Without those&#8230;.</p>

				<p>More information regarding my situation. sorry for bad grammar in a hurry.</p>
<p>Some of these actions deployed against me over the past year or more (which is the workings of more than one or more entities both in official and unofficial capacities, some using absolutely criminal methods while other entities are using more ethical means)</p>
<p>Constant entering of my apartment for &#8220;evidence&#8221; gathering and psychological profiling. And possible planting of surveillance equipment.</p>
<p>Physical mail theft from locked mailbox, preventing any correspondence with a legal advisor.</p>
<p>Phone hacked blocking communication with any legal advisor as well as keeping me from employment in attempt to financial ruin</p>
<p>automobile GPS and physically damaged to the extent its almost not derivable keeping me from traveling to legal advisement.</p>
<p>All email accounts compromised keeping me from legal advisement.</p>
<p>June 9th 2020 I was drugged while celebrating my graduation and woke up in the hospital inside a MRI with zero memory of any event. I had been viciously beaten and apparently had been found unconscious by unknown entities. My keys and phone were missing, but not wallet or money. I could tell I was drugged and the nurses stated they could tell as well. However, nothing showed up on blood and urine test except the I was 4 times over the legal limit. Doctors stated I was a victim of an assault and possibly robbery as I had no defensive cuts or marks.</p>
<p>June 14th 2021 I was drugged while having a few beers with a friend at the local bar. I was found outside by the capital building by a police officer. I could feel the effects of the drug and asked to go to hospital. My phone and keys to car, apartment, and mailbox were stolen, but not wallet. The doctors took blood and urine for testing. it came back negative, and instead suggested my BAC was 4 times over the legal limit and have sign of alcoholism. All nonsense. I have drank literally 2 times in  the past year, I only drink bud light beer. Both times I ended up in the hospital. the only two times ive ever been in the hospital in my life(as a patient). I had a very small tab, certainly nothing that one could pass out drunk with no memory of anything on the street.</p>
<p>I was able to pull my medical records after second visit as I was very suspicious at this point obviously. Both looked similar in terms of trying to paint me as an alcoholic, and drug addict. Substance abuse narcotics indicated testing positive for &#8220;marijuana&#8221; a perfectly legal state activity, in which I rarely partake anyways. The first medical record from 2020 also stated I had lacerations on my hands. This is 100% false, as I had no cuts, bruises anywhere on my hands forearms knuckles etc.</p>
<p>The policewomen that woke me up on the street told me I had a bunch of warrants out for assault. She didnt take me to jail. As soon as I got home from the hospital I attempted to look up said accusations via many tools such as local court house, police station, and data mining services. Zero records of said assaults. I have never been in a physical altercation in my life (aside from being beaten with no memory)</p>
<p>I have noticed many appear to be &#8220;participating&#8221; in this covert campaign against me. It appears I have been maliciously identified as a high level risk to society via local community watch and volunteer enforcement channels. such as ATIX</p>
<p>Upon first detecting something was very much &#8220;off&#8221; after my first drugging and beating, I was quickly able to detect to some degree that I had been targeted. I held off saying anything because I figured I had nothing to hide and would let those investigating come to their conclusions and move on. After this didnt happen, and I was able to detect malicious activities being taken to manufacture me as a criminal such as (illegal files found on computer, accusations of violent crimes, fraud, etc.),  after no credible evidence could be collected. I decided to take evasive actions of my own.  At this point I was deeply interested to see why this incredible effort was being employed against me as I had checked to make sure I had no outstanding charges or warrants as well as had others fact gather for me on my behalf. There was nothing. So after I realized the harassment and campaign against me wasnt stopping, I decided to take defensive actions of my own via a primary defensive security tool. Deception. Honey Pots. Disinformation. And just like a fly to honey I immediately had hands in the cookie jar. IP&#8217;s from contractors, local and federal entities, as well as international entities. All caught compromising my system via hacking techniques, some more sophisticated than others. Some hiding their tracks much better than others.</p>
<p>No warrants for this type of activity initially, nor would their be because I was doing nothing wrong. However, after said entities realized I was catching them they would back off and change hands to another group. Eventually I started baiting them in anticipation of eventual &#8220;charges&#8221; being brought against me that upon closer inspection would fall apart. Thus revealing everything being employed against me as well as repaying my black eye to those maliciously attacking me.</p>
<p>Again, I have not had any success reaching out to an attorney as all my communications are/were being intercepted and screened. All movements tracked in real time with incredible resources and efforts used to proactively stop any legal protections or representation. Some of the lengths that these entities have gone are out of this world. Using many new zerodays to hack apple icloud accounts and devices, infect linux machines, and hack various other accounts such as linkedin, outlook.com grammarly.com etc. I took a page from the playbook of the good guys and team I wanted to join when I went into cybersec, the US Govt. Defend forward and Raising the costs to the adversary. I Baited, and used high end anti detection tools such as Kaspersky, 360, which detected the various malware used and sent those detection to the relevant hosts, HIDS, IDS, high end Firewalls as well as high end honeypots as well as &#8220;suspicious&#8221; looking web activities.</p>
<p>While attribution is indeed hard, most didnt take the time to hide their tracks as they had me pegged as some sort of imbecile. That may or may not be accurate however I was able to collect indisputable evidence regardless. The latest  red team detected and likely those that drugged me and entered my apartment with the keys stolen from my last hospital incident. belonging to 76.<em>.</em>.21 (Temporarily withheld allowing chance to correct behavior.)</p>
<p>One might ask, why would anyone go through such extreme lengths to ruin someone, especially someone that is not a threat? Am I a terrorist? Pedophile? Human Trafficker? Gangbanger? Organized Crime? Anti-establishment? No to all. Not by a long shot regardless of what &#8220;secret evidence&#8221; might suggest otherwise. This all started back several months before I was forcefully &#8220;resigned&#8221; from employment. I had come across a significant issue in which I was told to forget about it. Shortly after I was pushed out as I was being demoted and told to come to the office everyday in the middle of the pandemic. Against the governors direct orders to work from home if possible. I was a remote worker before the pandemic was even known. They told me to come in from now on and work helpdesk (as I was a infosec employee) After I mentioned the poor health of my step father and brother in law, and that I didnt think it appropriate to come in for no reason, and asked for a reasonable compromise, I was immediately &#8220;resigned&#8221; that day. Resigned in an effort to deny me any underemployment benefits. It was only several days after being forced out all of this negative actions against me began. This is about a cover-up and retaliation by a billion dollar corporation and people abusing their power and authority in order to discredit and punish me. I have been kept from employment and financially ruined. I have not been able to get one job, due to the tactics being used against me which after investigating deeply I found to be a combinations of hacked email account in which correspondence was intercepted, hacked phone to block incoming and outgoing calls to perspective employers, hacked LinkedIn account, and simply spreading false information directly to a perspective employer.</p>
<p>The list of criminal actions that have been used against me in very long and even if I were honestly &#8220;suspected&#8221; of a crime, the immense efforts of criminal tactics used against me far exceeds anything I could be reasonably accused of. The idea of law enforcement and volunteers using criminal and violent tactics against an individual, in order to manufacture charges is morally bankrupt. Worse yet, instead of stopping when no credible charges could be found, instead of backing off those in question kept doubling down. At this point the trail of illegal and criminal actions is so long, their only option at this point is to charge me with something. However, any reasonably minded judge, or jury, or anyone with a shred of moral integrity will dismiss whatever may be headed my way as well as investigations into the extremely illegal methods used to try and manufacture evidence and paint an individual as a threat.</p>
<p>Im not a threat to society or to anyone. I am pro USA and pro US Military. I would say I lean toward conservative views however I voted for Biden because Trump appeared to not have leadership or problem solving skills when the country was in crises. So far Biden appears to be a man of Integrity and genuine resolve. I support him 100%. That doesnt mean im anti republican. OR Anti-establishment.</p>
<p>Those involved organized and calculated a scheme to &#8220;get&#8221; me by having me investigated and simultaneously likely unbeknownst to those investigating that there were others in play proactively and indirectly setting my up for &#8220;crimes&#8221; to be observed. I deserve an independent investigation in the name of a fair justice system. I am not aware at this point of all of the &#8220;evidence&#8221; and what false indicators or possibly manufactured to paint me a &#8220;threat&#8221;. Rest Assured anything that has &#8220;occurred&#8221; since I was fired  5/28/2020 is false and or manufactured. Any other charges prior to that date have been dismissed, for assisting LE and DHS. Which is easily provable as I have had loans, college, and background checks run for jobs and never once had any problems. As well as records. These charges appear to have &#8220;re-surfaced.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am not able to seek legal advice or aid as all of my modes of communication are heavily compromised and screened.<br />
Those that have compromised me don&#8217;t simply appear to be &#8220;monitoring&#8221; which is a legal and perfectly reasonable tool for legal court ordered activity. I have info of several separate contractors or organizations that have taken the initiative to &#8220;proactively&#8221; attempt to &#8220;ruin&#8221; me in lue of law enforcement not having the official authority based on real evidence to use the methods currently being deployed against me. The idea of allowing non-official actors to skirt legal requirements in order to catch a supposed criminal while allowing non-official covert malicious and criminal actors to viciously harass in attempt to manufacture actions that can better act as a sound legal basis for official actions is pure corruption and not indicative of a fair democratic society. In fact, it isnt unreasonable for any person of sound judgement to conclude these actions in there own right are indicative of cruel inhumane behavior. For any one that might wish help regardless of what picture you have painted of me, simply for the sake of civil and human rights, please get this to a good attorney as I am certain there will be many millions in damages after all facts come to light. I am not able to communicate or travel to any, my phone is tapped, physical mail intercepted and email accounts compromised. Ive been isolated while these people are monitoring for criminal activity to use against me while another team is harassing me to attempt to catch me do something or use something to manufacture. I believe in the rule of law, I believe in accountability, and if there is a justified case against me Im willing to tackle that head on. However, what is happening to me is a disgrace to justice, rule of law, democracy, those perpetration these actions are criminal to the core displaying malicious intent. Simply &#8220;doing ones job&#8221; and following along without proper court authority makes those &#8220;helping&#8221; accessory and equally culpable.</p>

				<p>@ Bruce, ALL,</p>
<p>This sounds like a good idea,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;First, the court should have access to the “Known Error Log,” which should be part of any professionally developed software project.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>But &#8220;having a log&#8221; and chosing &#8220;what goes in the log&#8221; are &#8220;way more than a country mile&#8221; appart.</p>
<p>The accounting profession has been arguing over &#8220;simple book keeping&#8221; for centuries and still does&#8230; What makes anyone think that we can safely legislate for what &#8220;MUST&#8221; go in such logs&#8230;</p>
<p>In any even minorly complex piece of software for business to log all the transition states to find out where a problem is, would be an almost impossible undertaking and we know that it will not be given to the &#8220;star programmers&#8221; so is likely to be closer to the 20% of lines defective than the 0.2% of lines defective end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s before the corporate &#8220;liability limitation lawyers&#8221; get in on the act.</p>
<p>Many here can remember some years back now that scandle after scandle rocked the &#8220;de-regulated finance market&#8221;. The legislators of the time effectively went cap in hand to the auditors and others tasked with policing the corporate and finance sectors and said &#8220;write your own wish list&#8221; well they did it got put into law&#8230;</p>
<p>The result we have as many financial scandles as ever, however they are now harder to prosecute or even explain to a jury.</p>
<p>So all that happened was the legislation made the dishonest evolve to a higher level of dishonesty.</p>
<p>This happens in part because there are virtually no downsides to the dishonest trying it on. They either get away with it or just buy their way out with tax deductable fines&#8230;</p>
<p>What is needed is not &#8220;pruning around the edges&#8221; but &#8220;root and branch changes&#8221; to the way corporates legaly exist and the way offending officers are dealt with.</p>
<p>One of the things mentioned was the Post Office Limited company run at the time by Paula Vennells[1] who took home atleast 5,000,000GBP in bonuses on top of her already inflated remuneration. She knew onky to well exactly what was going on, and that evidence of the wrongdoing was being kept from the innocent defendants, some of whom got driven to their deaths.</p>
<p>She is now the Reverend Paula Vennells and feels no shame what so ever for what she very knowingly did to line her own pockets whilst effectively killing and destroying innocent people&#8230;</p>
<p>But what the heck I guess in her psychopathic view point she was only doing &#8220;God&#8217;s Work, for their betterment&#8221;.</p>
<p>But what of those who followed her?</p>
<p>They have no intention what so ever of alowing justice to happen[2]</p>
<p>As Upton Sinclair so tactfully put it back in the 1930&#8217;s,</p>
<p><b>&#8220;It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Sometimes you need to take away rather more than the salary&#8230; The old Testiment had punishments including selling an offenders family into salavery and prostitution. Others have instituted removal of limbs, toungs, eyes, ears and even the ability to have children&#8230; Yet here we are centuries later and still we have not found a way to make the dishonest behave within the limits that the norms of society thing appropriate&#8230;</p>

				<p>Embedded System Guru Jack Ganssle wrote &#8220;2028 &#8211; A Dystopian Story&#8221; as a humors, and sad, view of such things as software logs and notebooks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ganssle.com/articles/2028adystopianstory.htm" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.ganssle.com/articles/2028adystopianstory.htm</a></p>
<p>From the above:</p>
<p>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 26 was amended in 1993 to require the disclosure of related case materials without awaiting a discovery request. In the 2000 case Kleiner v. Burns the court interpreted Rule 26 to include backup media, and even deleted files.  More than a few companies today prohibit engineering notebooks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rule 26. Duty to Disclose; General Provisions Governing Discovery&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_26" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_26</a></p>
<p>&#8216;The software engineers proposed a three-part test. First, the court should have access to the “Known Error Log,”&#8217;</p>
<p>Which I expect the prosecution pounces on as &#8220;You knowingly shipped a defective product as documented in your Error Log&#8221;.</p>
<p>If my accuser is a Breathalyzer or a Speed Trap Camera, do I not have the right to face them (ie. their source code)?</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn’t a technical issue, but a legal issue caused by poor policy: software needs regulation, liability, and copyright reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is about TicTok, however they make no distinction about &#8216;connected software&#8217; from Embedded Devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/09/executive-order-on-protecting-americans-sensitive-data-from-foreign-adversaries/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/09/executive-order-on-protecting-americans-sensitive-data-from-foreign-adversaries/</a></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; In evaluating the risks of a connected software application,<br />
     several factors should be considered.  Consistent with the<br />
     criteria established in Executive Order 13873, and in addition to<br />
     the criteria set forth in implementing regulations, potential<br />
     indicators of risk relating to connected software applications<br />
     include: ownership, control, or management by persons that<br />
     support a foreign adversary’s military, intelligence, or<br />
     proliferation activities; use of the connected software<br />
     application to conduct surveillance that enables espionage,<br />
     including through a foreign adversary’s access to sensitive or<br />
     confidential government or business information, or sensitive<br />
     personal data; ownership, control, or management of connected<br />
     software applications by persons subject to coercion or cooption<br />
     by a foreign adversary; ownership, control, or management of<br />
     connected software applications by persons involved in malicious<br />
     cyber activities; a lack of thorough and reliable third-party<br />
     auditing of connected software applications; the scope and<br />
     sensitivity of the data collected; the number and sensitivity of<br />
     the users of the connected software application; and the extent<br />
     to which identified risks have been or can be addressed by<br />
     independently verifiable measures. &#8230;</p>
<p>(d) The Secretary of<br />
     Commerce shall evaluate on a continuing basis transactions<br />
     involving connected software applications that may pose an undue<br />
     risk of sabotage or subversion of the design, integrity,<br />
     manufacturing, production, distribution, installation, operation,<br />
     or maintenance of information and communications technology or<br />
     services in the United States; pose an undue risk of catastrophic<br />
     effects on the security or resiliency of the critical<br />
     infrastructure or digital economy of the United States; or<br />
     otherwise pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of<br />
     the United States or the security and safety of United States<br />
     persons.  &#8230;</p>
<p>Sec. 3.  Definitions.  For purposes of this order:<br />
     (a) the term “connected software application” means software, a<br />
     software program, or a group of software programs, that is<br />
     designed to be used on an end-point computing device and includes<br />
     as an integral functionality, the ability to collect, process, or<br />
     transmit data via the Internet; &#8230;&#8221;</p>

				<p>This is a fantasy, as any programmer who&#8217;s ever debugged a production mishap will know; the programmer has no idea what the log should contain in advance, since (almost by definition) anything that goes is a situation that was not anticipated, so you don&#8217;t know what the log should contain in order to investigate it. You&#8217;re very frequently left looking at the whole system in despair, overwhelmed by lack of information about what happened in the real world and in the software.</p>
