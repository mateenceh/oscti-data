		<h2 class="entry">Vulnerabilities in Weapons Systems</h2>
		<p>&#8220;If you think any of these systems are going to work as expected in wartime, you&#8217;re fooling yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was Bruce&#8217;s response at a conference hosted by US Transportation Command in 2017, after learning that their computerized logistical systems were mostly unclassified and on the Internet. That may be necessary to keep in touch with civilian companies like FedEx in peacetime or when fighting terrorists or insurgents. But in a new era facing off with China or Russia, it is dangerously complacent.</p>
<p>Any twenty-first century war will include cyber operations. Weapons and support systems will be successfully attacked. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-can-disable-sniper-rifleor-change-target/">Rifles</a> and <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/07/27/technology/hack-smart-gun/index.html">pistols</a> won&#8217;t work properly. Drones will be <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/department-13-mesmer-drones-2017-1">hijacked</a> <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2019/10/01/has-iran-been-hacking-u-s-drones/">midair</a>. Boats <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/">won&#8217;t sail</a>, or will be <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2143499-ships-fooled-in-gps-spoofing-attack-suggest-russian-cyberweapon/">misdirected</a>. Hospitals <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/acf4ac78-c738-48c6-8de1-077697e062d6">won&#8217;t function</a>. Equipment and supplies will <a href="https://www.overdriveonline.com/electronic-logging-devices/article/14893028/hacking-trucks-cybersecurity-and-the-eld-mandate">arrive late</a> or not at all.</p>
<p>Our military systems are <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dire-possibility-cyberattacks-weapons-systems/">vulnerable</a>. We need to face that reality by halting the purchase of insecure weapons and support systems and by incorporating the realities of offensive cyberattacks into our military planning.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, militaries have established <a href="https://www.cybercom.mil/">cyber commands</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/16/next-world-war-wont-be-anything-like-last-heres-how-us-must-prepare/">developed</a> <a href="https://www.government.nl/binaries/government/documents/parliamentary-documents/2019/09/26/letter-to-the-parliament-on-the-international-legal-order-in-cyberspace/International+Law+in+the+Cyberdomain+-+Netherlands.pdf">cyberwar</a> <a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/french-application-of-international-rules-to-cyberwarfare/">doctrine</a>. However, much of the current discussion is about offense. Increasing our offensive capabilities without being able to secure them is like having all the best guns in the world, and then storing them in an unlocked, unguarded armory. They just won&#8217;t be stolen; they&#8217;ll be subverted.</p>
<p>During that same period, we&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/us/politics/russian-hacking-government.html">increasingly</a> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/10/1020596/how-chinas-attack-on-microsoft-escalated-into-a-reckless-hacking-spree/">brazen</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/11/israel-appears-confirm-cyberattack-iran-nuclear-facility">cyberattacks</a> by <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/global-consequences-escalating-us-russia-cyber-conflict">everyone</a> from <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-darkside-criminal-gang/">criminals</a> to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/26/the-incredible-rise-of-north-koreas-hacking-army">governments</a>. Everything is now a computer, and those computers <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/01/the-internet-of-things-dangerous-future-bruce-schneier.html">are vulnerable</a>. Cars, medical devices, power plants, and fuel pipelines have all been targets. Military computers, whether they&#8217;re embedded inside weapons systems or on desktops managing the logistics of those weapons systems, are similarly vulnerable. We could see effects as stodgy as making a tank impossible to start up, or sophisticated as retargeting a missile midair.</p>
<p>Military software is unlikely to be any more secure than commercial software. Although sensitive military systems rely on domestically manufactured chips as part of the <a href="https://www.dmea.osd.mil/TrustedIC.aspx">Trusted Foundry</a> program, many military systems contain the same foreign chips and code that commercial systems do: just like everyone around the world uses the same mobile phones, networking equipment, and computer operating systems. For example, there has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/us/politics/barr-5g.html">serious concern</a> over Chinese-made 5G networking equipment that might be used by China to install &#8220;backdoors&#8221; that would allow the equipment to be controlled. This is just one of many risks to our normal civilian computer <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/broken-trust-lessons-from-sunburst/">supply chains</a>. And since military software is vulnerable to the same cyberattacks as commercial software, military supply chains have many of the same risks.</p>
<p>This is not speculative. A <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-19-128.pdf">2018 GAO report</a> expressed concern regarding the lack of secure and patchable US weapons systems. The report observed that &#8220;in operational testing, the [Department of Defense] routinely found mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities in systems that were under development, yet program officials GAO met with believed their systems were secure and discounted some test results as unrealistic.&#8221; It&#8217;s a similar attitude to corporate executives who believe that they can&#8217;t be hacked &#8212; and equally naive.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-179.pdf">updated GAO report</a> from earlier this year found some improvements, but the basic problem remained: &#8220;DOD is still learning how to contract for cybersecurity in weapon systems, and selected programs we reviewed have struggled to incorporate systems&#8217; cybersecurity requirements into contracts.&#8221; While DOD now appears aware of the issue of lack of cybersecurity requirements, they&#8217;re still not sure yet how to fix it, and in three of the five cases GAO reviewed, DOD simply chose to not include the requirements at all.</p>
<p>Militaries around the world are now exploiting these vulnerabilities in weapons systems to carry out operations. When Israel in 2007 bombed a Syrian nuclear reactor, the raid was preceded by what is believed to have been <a href="https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/101001_ieee_insert.pdf">a cyber attack</a> on Syrian air defenses that resulted in radar screens showing no threat as bombers zoomed overhead. In 2018, a 29-country NATO exercise, <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/157833.htm">Trident Juncture</a>, that included cyberweapons was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/politics/russia-nato-jamming/index.html">disrupted</a> by Russian GPS jamming. NATO does try to test cyberweapons outside such exercises, but has limited scope in doing so. In May, Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary-general, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/enemy-hackers-target-nato-with-constant-cyberattacks-dj263x2lh">said</a> that &#8220;NATO computer systems are facing almost daily cyberattacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The war of the future will not only be about explosions, but will also be about disabling the systems that make armies run. It&#8217;s not (solely) that bases will get blown up; it&#8217;s that some bases will lose power, data, and communications. It&#8217;s not that self-driving trucks will suddenly go mad and begin rolling over friendly soldiers; it&#8217;s that they&#8217;ll casually roll off roads or into water where they sit, rusting, and in need of repair. It&#8217;s not that targeting systems on guns will be retargeted to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue; it&#8217;s that many of them could simply turn off and not turn back on again.</p>
<p>So, how do we prepare for this next war? First, militaries need to introduce a little anarchy into their planning. Let&#8217;s have wargames where essential systems malfunction or are subverted­not all of the time, but randomly. To help combat siloed military thinking, include some civilians as well. Allow their ideas into the room when predicting potential enemy action. And militaries need to have well-developed backup plans, for when systems are subverted. In Joe Haldeman&#8217;s 1975 science-fiction novel <i>The Forever War,</i> he postulated a &#8220;stasis field&#8221; that forced his space marines to rely on nothing more than Roman military technologies, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Military_institutions_of_Vegetius_in_fiv/sQlXAAAAcAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Flavius+VEGETIUS+RENATUS%22&amp;printsec=frontcover">like javelins</a>. We should be thinking in the same direction.</p>
<p>NATO isn&#8217;t yet <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/22/nato-we-want-to-go-to-war-with-you/">allowing</a> civilians not employed by NATO or associated military contractors access to their training cyber ranges where vulnerabilities could be discovered and remediated before battlefield deployment. Last year, one of us (Tarah) was listening to a NATO briefing after the end of the <a href="https://shape.nato.int/news-releases/exercise-cyber-coalition-2020">2020 Cyber Coalition</a> exercises, and asked how she and other information security researchers could volunteer to test cyber ranges used to train its cyber incident response force. She was told that including civilians would be a &#8220;welcome thought experiment in the tabletop exercises,&#8221; but including them in reality wasn&#8217;t considered. There is a rich opportunity for improvement here, providing transparency into where improvements could be made.</p>
<p>Second, it&#8217;s time to take cybersecurity seriously in military procurement, from weapons systems to logistics and communications contracts. In the three year span from the original 2018 GAO report to this year&#8217;s report, cybersecurity audit compliance went from 0% to 40% (those 2 of 5 programs mentioned earlier). We need to get much better. DOD <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3535797/the-cybersecurity-maturity-model-certification-explained-what-defense-contractors-need-to-know.html">requires</a> that its contractors and suppliers follow the <a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/cmmc/">Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification</a> process; it should abide by the same standards. Making those standards both more rigorous and mandatory would be an obvious second step.</p>
<p>Gone are the days when we can pretend that our technologies will work in the face of a military cyberattack. Securing our systems will make everything we buy more expensive &#8212; maybe a lot more expensive. But the alternative is no longer viable.</p>
<p>The future of war is cyberwar. If your weapons and systems aren&#8217;t secure, don&#8217;t even bother bringing them onto the battlefield.</p>

				<p>The Next Generation Squad Weapons program, currently underway, calls for a fire control system which is basically a computerized scope that performs all ballistic calculations for making accurate shots. These systems undoubtedly will have wireless connections to communications systems, and will therefore be hackable. This could cause a shot which the soldier aims at the enemy to hit somewhere else. Is there any emphasis in this system on cybersecurity? No.</p>
<p>BTW, this is always lacking in SciFi weapons: advanced targeting. Shots taken with these supposedly advanced weapons are far less accurate than a lever-action rifle from the old West.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Our military systems are vulnerable. We need to face that reality by halting the purchase of insecure weapons and support systems and by incorporating the realities of offensive cyberattacks into our military planning.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>That is kind of missing the point of these weapons,</p>
<p>A pile of scrap iron + a small pile of sand is what they realy are maybe ten bucks worth.</p>
<p>Now supply a little heat and other work and you have a few hundred dollars of equipment.</p>
<p>Now add an intangible called software and it&#8217;s worth tens or hundredsds of thousands of dollars or a lot lot more.</p>
<p>Weapons especially &#8220;smart weapons&#8221; are mostly worthless scrap sold off cheap after twenty years. Thus they make a realy great &#8220;financial vehicle&#8221; to turn &#8220;tax dollars&#8221; into &#8220;Private Equity&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a more important effect they are also a way to get the &#8220;petro-dollars&#8221; out of foreign economies back into the home economy, or into politicians political funds / pockets at the least.</p>
<p>Stopping such a process because the product might not work is very very very unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>The US policy for over a life time has been only to fight wars where they have an overwhelming advantage hence the &#8220;Bomb them back to the stone ages&#8221;. Super power conflict gets fought out by proxie wars in second and third world countries.</p>
<p>What upset the apple cart was &#8220;asymeyric warefare&#8221; on the homeland. I know it&#8217;s going to get a screaming response from some, but 9/11 was realy a non-event as far as warfare is concerned a few buildings destroyed and 3k casualties is not exactly big numbers in war.</p>
<p>However it made a point that I keep repeating,</p>
<p><b>The US was attacked by it&#8217;s own technology, technology on which it has become overly dependent</b></p>
<p>The response, was an excuse for an even bigger &#8220;Equity Transfer&#8221;, more weapons and worthless high tech.</p>
<p>The US has now through the stupidity of neo-con mantras become so fragile that it can be brought down by squirrels and in 9/11 by 10 dollars of box cutters and a few plane tickets, and now by microbes.</p>
<p>Any one remember Obama&#8217;s &#8220;Big Red Button&#8221; to turn the Internet off, well the US is so critically dependent on the Internet that turning it off would be the equivalent of &#8220;swallowing a bullet&#8221;.</p>
<p>But then all of this has been said endlessly over and over.</p>
<p>The US needs a critical rethink about not technology or even politics, but about it&#8217;s fundemental beliefes that drive it&#8217;s way of life that makes US society so dependent on just about every form of infrastructure that has been made so fragile that the fear of a breeze gets power turned of in California. Loss of a little power in Texas cascades as a chain reaction stops energy being generated due to lack of fuel and rampant profiteering stirs the noxious brew to even greater hights of failure.</p>
<p>It all comes down to the neo-con matras and behaviour, resilience is non existant thus fragility is rampant and yet people refuse to see the problem. Instead they just make it worse by thibking there is a technology fix&#8230;</p>
<p>A word to the wise,</p>
<p><b>Whilst technology can make things more robust, it can also make things fragile beyond recovery a whole lot less expensively and a whole lot faster.</b></p>
<p>But who cares if you can skim profits off shore and hop on an aircraft south when things go wrong, and be &#8220;to big to fail&#8221; so everyone else picks up the bill&#8230;</p>
<p>Colonial Pipeline is just the latest example of this deranged thinking, start expecting them to happen every few weeks untill people wise up.</p>

				<p>There is also the issue that many of these civilian systems may be serving both sides in such a war. For example it is important that global financial systems are operational and work for both sides and are independent of the military action.</p>
<p>If the generals start telling their respective banks not to interoperate that could escalate things much more quickly.</p>

				<p>@Clive @All</p>
<p>Aside from the inherent faults in these systems and their vulnerabilities both overt and covert, the Human Factor is a big black blob.</p>
<p>A good portion of these systems are created by Government Contracts to Approved and Vetted Corporations.  Using the Neo-Con methods of management, like many other Silicon Valley Corporations, they hire sub-sub-sub contractors to do the work.</p>
<p>A small green stream pours down hill.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the hill is a puddle of Approved Persons, mostly those who have a Security Clearance of one kind or another.  These folks are interchangeable cogs in the government pipeline but they are also the ones that create the programs and write the software.  They get a 6 month contract and then POOF!</p>
<p>There are large Corporations that specialize in providing these types of contractors and if you Get On The List, you can make a very nice pile of jack, working 6 months at a time in BFE USA (1).  Due to the No-Extensions Clause on the contracts, added to prevent contractors from becoming employees, the contractor simply rotates to another project.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s left is No System Integrity, No Continuity, No Testing (no one really knows what to test) and a pile of millions of lines of spaghetti code.  As probably a good number of folks have been handed civilian code systems for maintenance, upgrade or revamp and had to deal with Lazy Programming and no Documentation or Design Docs.  Even where those exist they are so out of date as to hard be worth screen reading time.  The risk is fairly minimal: Something borks in Accounting.</p>
<p>When something borks in Weapon Systems the outcome is far more dangerous.</p>
<p>It might not be any better if these folks were employees but it certainly doesn&#8217;t help much that they are not. The top dog companies what work the system really have no interest at all in the product they are supposed to provide.</p>
<p>Which is why I find it rather amusing that M.Bezos is planning on catching a ride into The Far Far Away. What could possibly go wrong&#8230; Better have an extra O-Ring in your pocket M. Bezos.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>ht tps://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/jeff-bezos-says-he-will-fly-into-space-next-month/</p>
<blockquote><p>
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has revealed on Instagram that he plans to fly on Blue Origin&#8217;s first human spaceflight next month.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go on this flight because it&#8217;s a thing I&#8217;ve wanted to do all my life,&#8221; Bezos, the richest person in the world, said in a post published Monday morning. &#8220;It&#8217;s an adventure. It&#8217;s a big deal for me.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>ht tps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster#Richard_Feynman</p>
<p><b>Richard Feynman</b></p>
<blockquote><p>One of the commission&#8217;s members was theoretical physicist Richard Feynman. Feynman, who was then seriously ill with cancer, was reluctant to undertake the job. He did so at the encouragement of his wife, Gweneth Howarth. She convinced him to go, saying he might discover something others overlooked. He also wanted to find the root cause of the disaster and to speak plainly to the public about his findings.[70] At the start of investigation, fellow members Dr. Sally Ride and General Donald J. Kutyna told Feynman that the O-rings had not been tested at temperatures below 50 °F (10 °C).[71] During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated how the O-rings became less resilient and subject to seal failures at ice-cold temperatures by immersing a sample of the material in a glass of ice water. While other members of the Commission met with NASA and supplier top management, <b>Feynman sought out the engineers and technicians for the answers.[72] (McDonald and his fellow Thiokol engineers had been so concerned about the danger presented by the low-temperature that McDonald refused to sign off on the launch; his supervisor signed off in his place.[73])</b> Feynman was critical of flaws in NASA&#8217;s &#8220;safety culture&#8221;, so much so that he threatened to remove his name from the report unless it included his personal observations on the reliability of the shuttle, which appeared as Appendix F.[72][74] In the appendix, he argued that the estimates of reliability offered by NASA management were wildly unrealistic, differing as much as a thousandfold from the estimates of working engineers. &#8220;For a successful technology,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.&#8221;[75]

<p>re: <i> breaking URLs </i></p>
<p>There are a lot of things that happen under the covers of HTML and web pages.  Some of them include pre-fetch or source parsing and MITM scanning (Ad Scanners if you are lucky, LEOs if you are not).</p>
<p>There are all sorts of scanners and harvesters on the transport layer between what you see, where it goes and what boomerang backs to you.  Some of these will be hunting for URLs too.</p>
<p>There are also loads of issues with URLs themselves.  They are easy to spoof and without very careful inspection can cause big problems.  We are trained to <b>Click</b> but we are not trained to <b>Look Before You Click</b>.</p>
<p>To minimize the above I insert a space in the URL.</p>
<p>You can clearly see where the link will go and you can decide for yourself if you want to follow the link.  Some folks use HXXP for the same purpose but afaik this is consider a link by many on the backend (google) just as if it were HTTP.  Putting a space in doesn&#8217;t provide any guarantee that google doesn&#8217;t run a regex to close it up automagically on their backend either. (1)</p>
<p>What it does it gives you the ability to decide: Do I want to go there?</p>
<p>Sometimes going there can be dangerous to your future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soldiers, tanks, people, shopping bags, painted lanes and sidewalks.</li>
</ul>
<p>===</p>
<p>1, RSSFeeders aren&#8217;t safe either. Even if the bot is collecting the new posts for you. The site owner can install an RSSFeedReaderCollector to pull up the same information as if you clicked on the link yourself. You won&#8217;t even know you have been harvested.</p>

				<p>Going out on a limb here to suggest that we all agree that it&#8217;s time to move past this idea that it&#8217;s necessary to kill other human beings to further whatever agenda.</p>

				<p>I dislike this war hungry essay for a lot of reasons. Publishing it reeks of &#8220;Atlantic Council&#8221; nod along. I find the focus and basic premise of the essay problematic for a lot of reasons. I&#8217;m not wholly convinced an authortarian mindset plus an Ayan Randian mindset is a step forward. There&#8217;s nothing special about NATO as a system. The author of the article is missing organisational &#8220;system crashes&#8221;, the human rights and social dimension, and low level resistance. All systems are attacked all the time. There is nothing new there.</p>
<p>The $50-250 Billion spending boost in the US to &#8220;counter China&#8221; is nothing of the sort. It&#8217;s just the US trying to dominate everybody again. Military spending which is restricted to US companies only is a nice way to get around laws against playing favourites with subsidies.</p>
<p>The US played dirty (i.e. lied) over TSR-2 and much more besides. TTIP is still fresh in my mind.</p>
<p>The Chinese have a problem applying Drucker and Oglvy and Parkinson too. (Classics worth reading today.) The order has gone out from the top that there are to be no restrictions on which hotels foreigners can stay in. However, lack of IT and onerous paperwork and police requirements put off smaller more provincial hotels. It&#8217;s not a huge problem to design a better and cheaper system. No dirty tricks required. No dodgy intelligence operatives required. Simply turn up and be nice and don&#8217;t be an idiot. If a few evangelicals or hard nosed shysters try it on and are slapped in jail that&#8217;s no problem. They do more damage than good in the UK too. In fact the American &#8220;Chicago School&#8221; has done more damage to the UK than China ever did. If the Chinese locked a few up they would be doing the rest of a us a favour. The point being there is only so much you can get from movies and television and newspapers. That is a manufactured or vicarious reality and too often has an agenda. You cannot beat real people meeting real people. The less fear and greed in the way the better too. Who knows after a few years they may decide they no longer need those onerous systems. It&#8217;s one step. There will be others.</p>
<p>Who is the &#8220;enemy&#8221;? Why do they have to be the &#8220;enemy&#8221;? I have strong issues with Russia&#8217;s human rights abuses and criminality and China&#8217;s authoritarianism and rip off mentality but America is not clean either. the first thought too often when an American opens their mouth now is &#8220;What are they trying to pull?&#8221; Think about that.</p>
