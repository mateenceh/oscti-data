		<p>A teenager on an airplane <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2021/07/25/apple-airdrop-threat-united-airlines-flight/?sh=6b38ad6ffe39">sent a photo</a> of a replica gun via AirDrop to everyone who had their settings configured to receive unsolicited photos from strangers. This caused a three-hour delay as the plane &#8212; still at the gate &#8212; was evacuated and searched.</p>
<p>The teen was not allowed to reboard. I can&#8217;t find any information about whether he was charged with any of those vague &#8220;terrorist threat&#8221; crimes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since we&#8217;ve had one of <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/11/how_we_won_the_war_o.html">these sorts of overreactions</a>.</p>

<p>No it isn&#8217;t. It is happening every day. And will continue as long fear is use to control people or until people learn.</p>

				<p>@ ALL,</p>
<p>Have you noticed how the travel writer &#8220;Suzanne Rowan Kelleher&#8221; trys to stir it up from a nothingburger story to an &#8220;OMG they are going to XXX us all&#8221; story with,</p>
<p>1, &#8220;someone was airdropping <b>inappropriate pictures</b>&#8221;<br />
2, &#8220;Airsoft guns <b>are so realistic that they can be easily mistaken for real guns&#8221;<br />
3, &#8220;how the teen shared the </b><b>alarming photo</b>&#8221;<br />
4, &#8220;passenger who <b>caused the disruption</b>&#8221;</p>
<p>Lets be honest here it was at worst a prank that due to the stupidity of Apple and it&#8217;s fanbois has been used for probably almoat as long as the teen has been alive for just exactly that &#8220;pranking&#8221;. The airline and others should know this at the very least ans think before leaping up and grabbing the &#8220;major incident response&#8221; folder from the shelf.</p>
<p>It realy begs the question if instead it had been a humorous hamster in an ovviously fake suicide vest would the aircraft have been stripped down to the last nut and bolt&#8230;</p>
<p>This sort of over reaction nonsense will carry on untill the idiots in charge suffer penalties for behaving the way they do&#8230;</p>
<p>If the airline had to say give each delayed passenger $1000/hour for the delay, you can bet ypur bottom dollar the situation would change rather rapidly back to the normality of a couple of decades ago.</p>
<p>That in turn would cause the likes of Apple to not be so idiotic either, with the result mobile phone security would probably improve&#8230; And so on down the supply chain.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest though in recent news certain &#8220;malware&#8221; on Apple phones due to crapy data format handling has been of intetest. Thus what is the betting the de-serialisation code that was being used for one, works just as well with air-drop?</p>
<p>I guess the real question people should be asking is,</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are we shooting ourselves in the foot with this crud almost every day one way or another?&#8221;.</p>
<p>And no I don&#8217;t blaim the teenager. Why, well for god alone knows how long teens have suffered from poor impulse control it goes with the transition from six year old school playground psychopath to fairly normal twenty something adult it&#8217;s just the way nature makes us&#8230;</p>

				<p>Truth be told, those with Open Airdrop should have been taken-in and interrogated, to find out why they need that capability, and are obviously threats to public order (antifa, blm, etc).</p>

				<p>@me   That takes me back to the late 60&#8217;s.  A fellow &#8220;wearer of the green&#8221; (hat tip to Clive) got great pleasure from replying to every &#8220;Hi, Jack&#8221; with &#8220;To Cuba??&#8221;  Got very old, very fast.  I resorted to always using his given name, John, to nip the tired joke.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  due to the stupidity of Apple and it&#8217;s fanbois
</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Now</em> who&#8217;s trying to &#8220;stir it up&#8221;?  You undermine your own position when you engage in ad hominem attacks like that.  The fact is, this was just another social engineering attack, not unlike swatting.  I seem to recall a past incident where someone used a name for their WiFi hotspot that was considered threatening.  There are countless other ways for jerks to be jerks on planes that have nothing to do with AirDrop or Apple in any way that makes it, according to the article author, &#8220;the most alarming aspect of this incident&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This sort of over reaction nonsense will carry on untill the idiots in charge suffer penalties for behaving the way they do?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Why single out those people?  Yes, they overreacted, but can we only come to that conclusion <em>in hindsight</em> or would it have been easy to determine in the moment?  The same question is at the heart of the swatting problem.  The article doesn&#8217;t go into detail on how the incident escalated, but how about <em>you</em> propose a procedure for them to follow that allows them to safely handle both this scenario as well as the &#8220;real&#8221; scenario where one or more armed passenger are planning to hijack the plane.  I mean, it&#8217;s not like the crew can just calmly get on the intercom and announce to the whole plane, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;ve got some pictures of guns getting sent around the plane; who can tell us what that&#8217;s all about?&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>
  And no I don&#8217;t blaim the teenager.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless there&#8217;s something significant that the story doesn&#8217;t cover, the main fault here <em>does</em> lie with the teen.  Charged with a crime or not, he should not be expecting to fly for a good long time.  Nor should anybody who screws around like that on a plane.  Yes, young and stupid go together, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re free from the consequences of your actions.</p>

				<p>Once again, technology baffles law enforcement and they try to apply aging legal standards to what amounts to nothing more then a prank. The action, not the consent is the issue; especially considering it is an image that does not contain nudity or violence, and inanimate object is just that. There were no words or threats written on the image. Thus the issue is that a file was shared and people didn&#8217;t know what to do when they received a file they did not ask for. Which at the lowest level is the same thing as getting spam in your inbox, snail mail spam in your mailbox or a leaflet on your car window. Do people freak out when they get a leaflet on their car for the upcoming gun show?</p>

<p>This is where cops are losing their lives, and nobody has any sympathy for them. Without a conviction in a court of law, the cops had better not be imposing any &#8220;consequences&#8221; imposed for alleged behavior. TSA be damned, U.S. Marshals be damned.</p>
<p>Kid better be able able to fly as a passenger or get his own pilot&#8217;s license if he pleases.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to bid a final <em>adieu</em> to those crooked cops. And we&#8217;d better stick to our guns and hold fast to our right to bear arms. Times are tough, and they&#8217;ll only get tougher until America&#8217;s corrupt court system is done away with and replaced with a system in accordance with the Constitution and with international principles of human rights, including the right to be armed for self-defense and defense of one&#8217;s country at large.</p>

				<p>@ Impossibly Stupid</p>
<blockquote><p>The fact is, this was just another social engineering attack</p></blockquote>
<p>No evidence of that statment at all, the teen just broadcast, the fact others left their &#8220;Apple door&#8221; wide open to &#8220;all comers&#8221; was entirely their own fault not the teens.</p>
<p>So your,</p>
<blockquote><p>You undermine your own position when you engage in ad hominem attacks like that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Looks misplaced at best, but it actually gets worse&#8230;</p>
<p>Hence why I said,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;due to the stupidity of Apple and it’s fanbois&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Do you actually know how much crap Apple enables effectively by default, just because some idiot developer or marketer thinks it&#8217;s a good idea to be &#8220;all things to all people&#8221;?</p>
<p>How about this little bit of fun?</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qepqzVtJRYI" rel="nofollow ugc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qepqzVtJRYI</a></p>
<p>They demo posting an air-tag and watch it&#8217;s progress through a geographical area as Apple device after Apple device relays the tags bluetooth signal back across the cellular network&#8230;</p>
<p>But how many Apple users know you can actually use those &#8220;air-tags&#8221; to track an Apple phone user without their knowledge, not many I&#8217;m sure  Which is why I won&#8217;t go into the details of how to do it, but it&#8217;s not at all difficult.</p>
<p>But also ask yourself an important question &#8220;How do the NSO’s Pegasus spyware Zero-Click attacks work?&#8221;</p>
<p>You will realise that the most likely cause is Apple puting in way too much in the wrong way. Thus making a bypass around the more traditional security mechanisms simply because of increased but unnecessary utility to users provided &#8220;transparantly&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Have you noticed how the travel writer “Suzanne Rowan Kelleher” trys to stir it up from a nothingburger story to an “OMG they are going to XXX us all” story with,</p>
<p>1, “someone was airdropping inappropriate pictures”<br />
2, “Airsoft guns are so realistic that they can be easily mistaken for real guns”<br />
3, “how the teen shared the alarming photo”<br />
4, “passenger who caused the disruption”</p>
<p>Lets be honest here it was at worst a prank that due to the stupidity of Apple and it’s fanbois has been used for probably almoat as long as the teen has been alive for just exactly that “pranking”. The airline and others should know this at the very least ans think before leaping up and grabbing the “major incident response” folder from the shelf.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally this is about two forms of extreme gendered behaviour. You&#8217;re also missing the philsophical difference between a shared joke and a malicious joke. The media by and large don&#8217;t really get these topics &#8220;in the round&#8221;.</p>
<p>Was enforcement an over-reaction? Yes and no, and you have to take a step back and seperate the risk analysis from hindsight.</p>
<p>Very few people are qualified to discuss any of these topics and few are qualified to discuss all of these topics all at the same time. I cannot off the top of my head think of anyone and I follow all three topics closely including reading reference books ad academic papers and policy documents.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a citation to hand but it is a truism in martial arts that amateurs over-react. This is why the law treats an expert and a none expert differently. Experts have fewer excuses&#8230; It is also true in bureaucratic systems and true in situations involving discrimination. Lack of expertise and training leads to bad decisions and polarisation and swings from one extreme to another.</p>
<p>At an operational level policy to a large degree is a codification of views and by and large excellent only in theory and more a backstop for stupidity. The reason is organisations only have so many resources and cannot train everyone to a high level of expertise in all subjects even if they had the aptitude. This is also why our brains take shortcuts otherwise we would freeze and be unable to function because the processing load is simply too high.</p>
<p>You were beating up &#8220;coders&#8221; again the other day. I&#8217;d rather you didn&#8217;t. It is extremely irritating and conceals more than it reveals. I also notice in your first paragraph you picked on &#8220;the travel writer “Suzanne Rowan Kelleher&#8221;&#8221;. Yes she has a role in this affair and yes she has responsibility but my radar is twitching with the suspicion you have a &#8220;woman problem&#8221; while glossing over the jerk teenager with &#8220;boys will be boys&#8221;.</p>
<p>There is much more to this simple case study than what appears on the surface which is why it is essential to step back and look at things &#8220;in the round&#8221;.</p>
<p>@Impossibly Stupid</p>
<p>Reading through your response later I agree with all your points.</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8230;those with Open Airdrop should have been taken-in and interrogated, to find out why they need that capability&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>@All:<br />
Who has recently had the pain of sanitising a brand new iPhone, or android device? I&#8217;m with @Clive here, Apple, and Google&#8217;s elves, leave these things open, just because…</p>
<p>These devices are intended for playful teenagers, not for olds like us. There is no longer a printed manual in the box explaining what each function button does. You can&#8217;t even download a pdf for that. And with each major point revision of the OS the settings get moved around to more obscure and unrelated places.</p>
<p>Is there any chance the Board of Apple could get a flying ban for this?</p>

				<p>It might be getting used for smuggling data as we speak, think about a courier that lives only in your memory.</p>
<p>On a lower level the same mechanism that implements airdrop could determine environmental saturation of apple devices or more loosely population density through 802.11 listening and by.</p>
<p>It would explain the explosion of these legal malware groups and all sides keeping it hush hush.</p>

				<p>Remember the important lessons from this story, kids:</p>
<ul>
<li>next time use a burner phone</li>
<li>only handle it with gloves</li>
<li>use it from the plane&#8217;s lavatory</li>
<li>once you&#8217;ve sent the pictures, leave the phone there</li>
</ul>
<p>You might still get caught and punished, but it&#8217;ll take a lot more work for them to pull it off, and if they do, it&#8217;ll provide valuable lessons like this for the next kid who tries it.</p>

				<p>@ echo,</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes she has a role in this affair and yes she has responsibility but my radar is twitching with the suspicion you have a “woman problem”</p></blockquote>
<p>I would suggest you leave the psychobable to others&#8230;</p>
<p>Every so often someone here thinks they can psychobable me, they all have two things in common,</p>
<p>1, They all fail miserably to shoot in even close to a right direction, let alone find any kind of target. In fact their appear to aim at their podia[1].</p>
<p>2, They all actually say more about their own mental health state than they do about anything else.</p>
<p>But in this case my comment,</p>
<blockquote><p>“the travel writer “Suzanne Rowan Kelleher””</p></blockquote>
<p>Is just a factually correct statment taken from the top of the article where it indicates she is a &#8220;writer&#8221; not a &#8220;journalist&#8221; or one sepecialising in the area of airline or similar security. That is her opinion technically is nothing more than hearsay not qualified as opinion.</p>
<p>But you know the funny thing about this?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s you carping on about how you view me as sexisist or mysoginistic because I use the English language in the correct manner and style with regards pronouns that you appear to not want used&#8230;</p>
<p>So as William Shakespeare once noted of others, you&#8217;ve banged your petard in the door and got hoist by it&#8230;</p>
<p>Even you will have to admit there is a certain ironical humour in that&#8230;  I guess there will be one or two wry smiles.</p>
<p>[1] Yes it also implies they are likely to be clew less if they succeed but hey, if they want to be square and two sheets to the wind that&#8217;s their choice, nobodies said they could not have a different tack if they so wished and atleast got closer reach.</p>

				<p>Thanks for this topic.<br />
To all you African ESL people out there:  &#8220;Counterterrorism&#8221; = &#8220;Against Terrorism&#8221;!</p>
<p>(I once met a guy who thought counterterrorism was a form of terrorism)</p>
<p>It reminds me of when I was in my 9th grade art class:<br />
I was tempted to make a replica of a (tv show style) bomb.</p>
<p>At the time, (in the past), I didn&#8217;t know how to rewire my clock radio to emulate an LED digit countdown, so I gave up the art project.  Nevertheless, I had already discovered that red tissue paper spray glued onto oaktag looked like the dynamite sticks on tv shows, when rolled into cylinders.</p>
<p>More importantly, I realised several years later, that if I had followed through with my art idea, I probably would have been expelled from high school and sent to a juvenile detention home or something.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kinda funny the kinds of innocent fun games us Cold War generation kids came up with for mild amusement despite the spookiness of it all.</p>
<p>These days, I avoid visual communication styles most of the time.<br />
But I can kind of relate to the modern security concerns too.</p>
<p>P.S. = That&#8217;s also why I decided against creating a sculpturette replica of a handgun out of Kum &amp; Go red drinking straws.  (They are a potentially lethal gang sign, depending upon where they are left, what they are with, and if they are sheathed).</p>
<p>I got more important things on my mind than causing problems for others.<br />
Thank goodness for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>

				<p>@Clive, your rants opposing echo and Impossibly Stupid just show the large extent of your ego and pride. Your comments contribute little at this point other than to throw a tantrum to rival Donald Trump&#8217;s.</p>
<p>You previously stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>And no I don’t blaim the teenager. Why, well for god alone knows how long teens have suffered from poor impulse control it goes with the transition from six year old school playground psychopath to fairly normal twenty something adult it’s just the way nature makes us…</p></blockquote>
<p>You have accused others of having responses that reflect them more than you&#8230;well, this quote shows that you were one of those suffering from &#8220;poor impulse control.&#8221; Well, not all of suffered from &#8220;poor impulse control&#8221; as teens, so that not the &#8220;way nature makes us,&#8221; as you claim. It&#8217;s time children were taught that every choice has a consequence (positive or negative). Instead, so many dismiss it as &#8220;boys will be boys&#8221; or &#8220;teens will be teens&#8221; or insulting them with &#8220;their brains aren&#8217;t fully developed yet so they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing.&#8221; Teens aren&#8217;t stupid and it is totally this teens fault and I hope he gets on the no-fly list for a long time to contemplate his &#8220;sense of humor.&#8221;</p>

<p>re: <i> using a burner phone  </i></p>
<p>Your list</p>
<ol>
<li>    next time use a burner phone
</li>
<li>    only handle it with gloves
</li>
<li>    use it from the plane’s lavatory
</li>
<li>    once you’ve sent the pictures, leave the phone there
</li>
</ol>
<p>Is a bit short of the mark.</p>
<p>You need to completely and totally destroy the phone and all the components to prevent or hope to prevent the phone from being of use.  The metadata is already gone with whatever you sent so that&#8217;s not fixable.  But you need to fix or destroy the physical device.</p>
<p>There are plenty of science papers about retrieving information from parts or portions of devices.  Even something as simple as screen-burn can be used.  The magnetic fields that are generated leave magic marks and there have been some science papers detailing how they use the strength of the magnetic field to determine what was there and what changed.</p>
<p>Making something unusable is pretty hard.</p>
<p>When the CIA left Iran during the end of the USA regime there, they also left a bazillion bags of shredded documents.  The shredded documents were very tiny, and the shredded item was separated into multiple bags.</p>
<p>The CIA thought it was safe and they didn&#8217;t have time to burn it all.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t safe.</p>
<p>They forgot about the determination of a horde of people doing puzzle work, a la Bletchley Park but a lot more people.  Eventually they pieced together every diplomatic cable thought to have been beyond reconstruction.</p>
<p>To more thoroughly destroy a device, check the videos of when the GCHQ required The Guardian newspaper to destroy their file servers that had held the encrypted files provided by Snowden.</p>
<p>At the time I thought the GCHQ were just being berks, but they weren&#8217;t they were terrified.</p>

<p>Again, this has almost nothing to do with Apple, because other technologies can and have been used to panic people on planes, as I pointed out.  You also fail to address the parallels to swatting.  Please stick to the basic points I have made rather than going off on yet another anti-Apple rant.  You&#8217;re welcome to start your own blog if you can&#8217;t do Bruce the courtesy of staying on topic here.</p>

<p>Yet another non sequitur rant.  I never said anything about cops.  But see how fast airlines stop wanting to do business with you when you pull this kind of nonsense on flights.  Is having a civil society really such a big ask these days?</p>

				<p>@ veracity,</p>
<p>Funny another new handle pops up and makes an asinine comment of,</p>
<blockquote><p>your rants opposing echo&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Like you @echo made a ditrct personal attack without cause or reason, one assumes because you are incapable of doing otherwise.</p>
<p>That is you &#8220;attack the man&#8221; not the messahe, then get upset because you get treated the same way but come out the looser.</p>
<p>Do you wonder why you come out the looser? That is what it is in your personality that makes you so?</p>
<p>Others might be kind and tell you others may just laugh at you.</p>
<p>As for giving you a clue perhaps you should reflect on your own words,</p>
<blockquote><p>Your comments contribute little at this point other than to throw a tantrum to rival Donald Trump’s</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect &#8220;Dear Donald&#8221; had rather mote style than you do, does that some how gaul you? Because it does say much about you.</p>
<p>But you go on with your failings with,</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s time children were taught that every choice has a consequence (positive or negative).</p></blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;ve made such a choice so time for the consequences of your rather out of date paternalistic view on human development. You realise it&#8217;s the same one that favours &#8220;beat the child till they obay&#8221; and similar conservative dogma that gets passed from parent to child down the generations along with that faux bonhomie of &#8220;Never did me any harm&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>And so we get down to the real nub of your issue,</p>
<blockquote><p>Teens aren’t stupid and it is totally this teens fault and I hope he gets on the no-fly list for a long time</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh dear so &#8220;milk of human kindness&#8221; not, I suggest you concentrate more on the message in the &#8220;New Testiment&#8221; rather than trying to be all &#8220;Old Testiment&#8221; because it realy does make you look not just silly but old school parochial vigilante building up your pointless ire to try and look more sanctimonious and bible thumping than others.</p>
<p>Tell me do you get urges to scream &#8220;burn the witch&#8221; or call on Gods damnation against all those you see as having slighted you who must therefore be sinners who will not repent or similar? Do you get those Walter Mitty dreams of being the omnipotent hero who people fail to see thus fail to revrence as is your due? Are your opinions ignored or blanked by others?</p>
<p>Guess what you &#8220;show the signs&#8221; or the &#8220;stigma&#8221; of having been treated with the rod not the understanding direction, and so another generation is cursed to fail.</p>

<blockquote><p>I would suggest you leave the psychobable to others…</p></blockquote>
<p>That and the rest of your comment is misdirection, Clive. Clearly, a weak spot and you&#8217;re hiding something.</p>
<p>Please do go and check every single line of my orginal post with an expert in each relevent subject then get back to me. Like I said before I&#8217;ve had QC&#8217;s gang up and mock me in the past only for a professor and PhD in the relevant subject to poke their nose in and say I&#8217;m right. I really don&#8217;t want to have to go back over every single post you&#8217;ve made over the past six months and throw your own words back in your face so stop picking on &#8220;coders&#8221;. You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. And yes I am taking it personally.</p>
<p>Rote learned engineering doesn&#8217;t change or doesn&#8217;t change very often. Other fields are constantly in flux within a history and context. There&#8217;s also a lot of known knowns and fairly basic stuff everyone should know but doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>@JonKnwsNothing</p>
<blockquote><p>At the time I thought the GCHQ were just being berks, but they weren’t they were terrified.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a fair comment. In my opinion on reflection GCHQ were being berks but like you say the Pandora&#8217;s box was a thing.</p>
<p>I have my suspicions GCHQ, and MI5 and SIS are berks going by their public comments on national security and foreign threats. There&#8217;s a whole lot of fast works and finger pointing which distracts from governance issues at home. The words &#8220;careerist&#8221; and &#8220;political&#8221; spring to mind.</p>
<p>Compare and contrast UK security services alarmist public statements over the past few years and ore recent public statements over the past few months. These &#8220;dozens&#8221; of disrupted terrorist plots where we&#8217;re all supposed to go into &#8220;duck and roll&#8221; mode turned out to be mostly duds, they let slip. There&#8217;s also the curious lack of taking a position on the far right threat while we have the most extremist and human rights abusing government in living memory. I just find things don&#8217;t add up.</p>
<p>Reading things six months or 2-3 years or more apart is different from reading something at the same time and comparing them. You begin to catch them saying &#8220;something&#8221; then and &#8220;something not the same&#8221; now. You begin to catch the exaggerating, the misdirection, claims of &#8220;something must be done&#8221; and curious inaction. It&#8217;s all &#8220;terribly British&#8221;, don&#8217;tcha know. Back in the day you couldn&#8217;t do this as newspapers found their way to the bin and video tapes were reused and memories faded but it&#8217;s all out there now. All online. All searchable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/30/mps-rebuke-police-for-systemic-failure-to-improve-record-on-race" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/30/mps-rebuke-police-for-systemic-failure-to-improve-record-on-race</a></p>
<blockquote><p>MPs rebuke police for ‘systemic failure’ to improve record on race.</p>
<p>Failings have led to ‘unjustified inequalities’, says landmark report that finds little progress in 22 years since Macpherson</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The report notes: “Those we heard from in London expressed strong sentiments of anger and frustration towards the police, particularly about the way in which they felt police officers did not treat them fairly or with respect, and also expressed the lack of confidence they had that the police would keep them safe.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Like the police I wonder if the security services have governance issues and blind spots.</p>

				<p>@ echo,</p>
<blockquote><p>Please do go and check every single line of my orginal post with an expert in each relevent subject then get back to me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh the classic time waste misdirection used by those who realy can not get to a point succinctly or relevantly, as generally they can not.</p>
<p>Then you trot out your &#8220;But I&#8217;m wonderfull&#8221; nonsense with a Percy Bysshe Shelley &#8220;Ozymandis&#8221; style epitaph,</p>
<blockquote><p>Like I said before I’ve had QC’s gang up and mock me in the past only for a professor and PhD in the relevant subject to poke their nose in and say I’m right.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting &#8220;the worlds against me&#8221; style phraseology&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a line you keep trotting out yet evidenced by what? How you remember it as being the victor in your own mind? Of how you think history should have been written in your favour but was not for &#8220;sexist reasons&#8221; of &#8220;the old boys club&#8221; etc?</p>
<p>But then we get to what threats?</p>
<blockquote><p>I really don’t want to have to go back over every single post you’ve made over the past six months and throw your own words back in your face</p></blockquote>
<p>Then we get back to the nub of your petulant little hissy fits,</p>
<blockquote><p>so stop picking on “coders”. You don’t know what you’re talking about.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunatly whilst I&#8217;ve provided reasoned argument, both historical and contempory you have &#8220;hand waved and well what exactly? prevaricate, equivocate, or worse?</p>
<p>Of factual and testable argument? Hmm let me think, what was there that you gave? Do you know nothing comes immediately to mind was there actually ever anything of substance?</p>
<p>But I guess most people can work that out as your condem yourself with your own words,</p>
<blockquote><p>And yes I am taking it personally.</p></blockquote>
<p>You remind me of that old saw,</p>
<p><b>The man who is his own lawyer has a fool for his client.</b></p>

				<p>@ impossibly stupid,</p>
<blockquote><p>Again, this has almost nothing to do with Apple, because other technologies can and have been used to panic people on planes, as I pointed out. </p></blockquote>
<p>Oh dear god, are you actually listening to yourself?</p>
<p>Are you actually standing back and thinking, or are you just totaly fixated and genuflecting at the corporate altar of the sacred white sacrement?</p>
<p>Or is it the Upton Sinclair observation that has put a plank in your eye?</p>

				<p>@ Errm,</p>
<blockquote><p>Upton Sinclair?</p></blockquote>
<p>He was once fairly well known, and others here do mention him from time to time.</p>
<p>Back in the 1930&#8217;s he stood for political office in the mistaken belief that humans could follow some form of &#8220;enlightend self interest&#8221; thus &#8220;vote rationally&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Like others before and since, he was quite shocked about what he found.</p>
<p>He made several onservations about life and peoples motivations, one of the more famous is,</p>
<p><b>&#8220;It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>The issue at the heart of this particular story is Apple have a function they designed in because they could, that leaves a users device open to &#8220;open broadcasts&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a function that has been around for a while and is frequently used for making &#8220;pranks&#8221; by teenagers and younger. You would expect that after so long and so many &#8220;kids&#8221; knowing about it the relevant parts of the security industry would be aware of it as well thus would take it into their thinking.</p>
<p>But&#8230; Do they behave &#8220;rationally&#8221;? Err no. Do they work in a &#8220;minimal harm fasion&#8221;? Err no&#8230;</p>
<p>What do they actually do?</p>
<p>Well they dive off at the deep end spend unknown amounts of money put scare stories out and well act in a way that also suggests the Upton Sinclair observation might be part of their reasoning&#8230;</p>
<p>It must be two decades now since our host @Bruce coined the expression &#8220;Security Theatre&#8221; to cover such behaviours&#8230; Yet here we are half a working life time later and the situation is getting worse not better. Worse some people actually take such strange behaviours as being the &#8220;only true rational behaviour&#8221; as gospel&#8230; It&#8217;s actually known as &#8220;Authoritarian Follower&#8221; thinking and is highly prevelent in certain personality types.</p>
<p>Look at it this way, if you see an elephant heading your way, as a small creature what&#8217;s your best option,</p>
<p>1, Get well out of the way?</p>
<p>2, Hide under a rock the elephant can eaaly stand on and crush down into the soil?</p>
<p>We appear to be heading for the rocks, not just when an elephant actually comes distantly into view, but when some one hints that elephants exist&#8230;</p>
<p>But saying &#8220;Hey we realy should be reviewing this behaviour&#8221; causes some to have a fit of the vapours, you thus have to ask why that might be?</p>
<p>Is it some kind of cognative inability on their behalf or something else like their salary, status, power base, or religious equivalent&#8230;</p>
