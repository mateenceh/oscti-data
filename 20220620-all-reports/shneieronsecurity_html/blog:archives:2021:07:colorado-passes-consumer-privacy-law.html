				<p>UK and EU data protection law has been better for years than the listed table of comparisons. The main areas of divergence are thresholds, consent and opti-in and opt-out, and remedy. UK and EU data protection is secure for the citizen by default across the board. While this is a step forward by the US I hate to image what the legal gotches are and how the loopholes in the policies will be exploited.</p>
<p>In the UK data protection violations are prosecuted with remedies and in some instances large fines. All the citizen has to do is complain to the regulator and sit back and watch the fireworks.</p>
<p>On balance I feel the GDPR was an inprovement over existing UK data protection in law in theory and practice, and with the added heft of the EU behind it did more on a European and global stage.</p>
<p>Two interesting documents here on the influence of the GDPR, and a table comparing the UK&#8217;s Data Protection Act and GDPR.</p>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation: A Comparative View of Key IssuesThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) was approved by the European Parliament in April 2016.   As a regulation, it  is  directly applicable without the need for domestic legislation and it is due to be applicable in all member states from 25thMay 2018.  It shall effectively repeal the current data protection regime under the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”) and introduce a new framework regulating the processing of personal data</p>

Thanks for the links. These are interesting.</p>
<p>I think these US statutes are also preemptive me-too legislation. The industry&#8217;s  biggest risk is that the GDPR will be forced upon them by default. By passing ineffective laws that look like they protect consumers, they can prevent, or at least delay, the introduction of effective laws.</p>
<p>With the EU the biggest trade block on the planet, the GDPR is making itself felt everywhere.</p>

				<p>Obviously &#8220;Consumer Privacy Law&#8221; only apply to people who did not give their consent, so if you have accepted something like the Facebook user agreement (by the fact that you are using Facebook), then it does not really apply to you.</p>
<p>This stuff is so complex it will finish like the list of software licenses you have to accept to run Windows (licenses for Windows software, for the graphic card, the camera, for the sound chipset, the Ethernet driver, the mouse and keyboard, &#8230; and any of their security upgrade): a screen is presented where you are allowed to check the box &#8220;accept all licenses&#8221; (without any of the license text) if you would like to continue&#8230; else you are allowed to power-off your PC. Skipping one way or another the license approval is soo illegal you&#8217;d better not pretend to have done it.</p>
<p>Concerning &#8220;echo&#8221; comment, I really hate that one company has to track me personally so that they can &#8220;fulfil their duty of not contacting me&#8221; due to my  GDPR request to be erased from their database. No way to be erased from the database of the people having contacted them under GDPR laws.</p>

<p>I felt aspects of the US law gave in to business and marketing and perhaps a few of the more foaming at the mouth &#8220;libertarian constitutionalists&#8221;.</p>
<p>I imagine if you point fingers at a few of the more mercenary lobbyists there will be boggled eyes look of shocked indignation and jowl wobbling sputtering protests. Politicians with all the front of a sound stage wild west saloon and glass jaws to match are hardly going to rat them out as they count the election funding and wrap themselves in flags of borrowed valour.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a European and anti-Brexit so obviously biased but the EU does treat the European Covention seriously. It is also a trading bloc and I&#8217;m pretty sure Commssion staff are aware that not just fraud but privacy are not just blocks to human rights but blocks to trade too. Unfortunately smug superiority can only get you so far as Europe has just bungled right to repair.</p>
<p>The EU Parliament briefing is worth a read just to see where discussion is heading. One thing which rarely gets a mention in these kinds of discussions (including on data protection) is predictability, stability, and mental health. There are also other benefits too such as privacy enhanced communication and innovation and repairability especially beyond the expected life expectancy of the product can encourage invention and other social benefits. It&#8217;s all that trivial and touchy feely huggy stuf which has some people throwing their canes at the television but used to be a large component of much of Western culture up until customer gave way to consumer.</p>

<blockquote><p>We urgently need a universal Right To Repair</p>
<p>The Ecodesign measures coming into force today are a great step forward. Energy labels are improved and combined with the repairability measures, they’re expected to jointly deliver 167 TWh of energy savings every year by 2030, as much as the final annual energy consumption of Denmark[1] .</p>
<p>But the many restrictions for consumers and independent repairers are a good illustration of how far we still are from having a true universal Right to Repair in Europe. </p>
<p>This is why the Right to Repair movement has been campaigning in Europe for the past year, pushing for more ambitious rules that extend products’ lifetime, support consumers’ desire for more repairable products and benefit a sustainable economy.</p></blockquote>

				<p>@ATN<br />
&#8220;so if you have accepted something like the Facebook user agreement (by the fact that you are using Facebook), then it does not really apply to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The concept of &#8220;informed consent&#8221; is central to Privacy Law, and the GDPR. Consent must be meaningful, intentional, and free. Which means, that is legally invalid if it is based on incomplete or incomprehensible information, is not intentional, or is part of a tied sell.</p>
<p>The GDPR is pretty clear, consent can never be implicit, e.g., you use it, so you consent, it must be based on easy to comprehend information, not on 100 pages of legalese privacy policy, and should not be a prerequisite for just reading the page or using the service.</p>
<p>In the EU, few if any FB users have given their Informed Consent in the sense of the GDPR. So FB is going through a lot of legal proceedings in the EU to ward off what looks like the inevitable.</p>

				<p>Only CA has a right of private action, and that only for security breaches. As Facebook will prefer not to tell you, co-opting a data protection registrar (DPA in Ireland) is all you need to do to avoid following the law.</p>
<p>The &#8220;cure&#8221; feature in the laws is nonsense, and effectively nullifies the laws because there&#8217;s now no incentive to follow it &#8211; just fix each specific problem when complained about. If that was true for shoplifting, you&#8217;d only have to return the goods that you were caught pinching.</p>

<p>We the people are grieved by the &#8220;Federal&#8221; or in other words Communist Party form of government which had come to exist in the United States and the E.U. which we feel are headed for the same fate as the former U.S.S.R.</p>
<p>Policies passed by a Parliament of unelected &#8220;Christian&#8221; Democrat delegates have very limited interpretation as &#8220;laws&#8221; to be enforced as such by fines and prison terms.</p>
<p>The same of course can be said of federal laws, USC, CFR, etc., in the U.S. whether for instance an election was actually held on the 20th of January or if the whole thing was a fraud after the January 6 &#8211;<br />
<em>coup d&#8217;état,</em> and they keep telling us there was no evidence, Democrat until proven Republican, as if the Democrats<br />
are so innocent, because in practice the feds just call it child pornography, skip the court process altogether, and put anybody in prison for anything they want, there&#8217;s a Reich and they&#8217;re shipping &#8220;Jews&#8221; off to concentration camps.</p>

<p>Sure. Much of the problem is in fact with the small-town Republican &#8220;parochialism&#8221; of states, provinces, counties, boroughs, cities, towns, villages, municipalities, cantons, parishes, etc., passing ineffective local laws and ordinances which are unenforceable outside the boundaries of each red-light district — with the usual barratry of frivolous intellectual property claims and patent troll lawsuits in court, arbitrary and capricious local court decisions, and law enforcement decisions to &#8220;railroad&#8221; policies as law without any court process at all.</p>

<p>I find your comments almost, if not totally, incomprehensible. I have no clue why you think the rule of Stalin and Bresznev had anything in common with the European Commission. I cannot see any parallels and you also do not tell us where you see them. Also, where do you see the concentration camps in Europe? Please tell us.</p>
<p>As for the quote, FYI, the European Parliament is chosen in free and fair elections. If you have evidence to the contrary, please let us know.</p>

<p>Additionally anyone can write to an EU commissioner and request they investigate an issue or write directly to the EU Commission and request they propose a law. Citizens of EU member states can write to their Euro MP&#8217;s. This is all in addition to the existing rights of representation held by citizens in member states.</p>
<p>Subsidiarity is a principle of the EU in that power is to be conferred to the lowest competent level. Also human rights may not be derogated.</p>
<p>As for two names in particular on this blog they seem to be posting a pick and mix selection of largely far right talking points with a strong US bias all woven together. It&#8217;s quite the Rorschach test. &#8220;Incomprehensible&#8221; is the best I can say of them.</p>

<blockquote><p>Only 20% of consumers are saying yes to Apple’s App Tracking Transparency prompt, which means they will enable apps to personalize ads by tracking their personal data. For the traffic Bowman’s company evaluated, performance has faded. Across paid social platforms, downstream event optimization and “lookalike audience performance” is also eroding.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is interesting real world data. My personal view is that platform design and marketing funnels and encourages users towards certain types of behaviour. Some people will obviosly complain if this does&#8217;t work anymore but there are questions. For instance I read someone saying the other day that their reading of books had dropped off because of Twitter. Other people at an extree may play more games tha is physically healthy for them and in some cases the sheer amount of time taken up puts relationships and marriages under strain. People only have so much time and energy and money and I feel this whole argument isn&#8217;t about who is spending or not spending but who gets the money.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there is an academic kicking about or academic papers on this but is it really a net opportunity loss for an economy if privacy and human rights law ends up putting the brakes on some people&#8217;s endevours? That time and effort and money will be going somewhere else perhaps better, healthier, and some may say wiser than where it would otherwise have gone. In fact it may be possible the gains are significant enough there is a compelling case for stronger legislation.</p>

<p>Same old Democrat trope as in the U.S. &#8220;There&#8217;s no evidence.&#8221; Just like the Mobsters running elections out of Tammany Hall in the days of Al Capone.</p>
<p>Guys got drunk Saturday night, and somehow got off the property before the cops showed up at the pub, the girls were hustled off to the abortion clinic in the middle of the night, their buddies got around early in the morning picked the locks and stole the rape kits from the evidence room at the police station, and now there&#8217;s a whole political party of righteous women in church on Sunday, other guys are sitting back listening to the sermon taking notes.</p>

<p>Of course. This all happened in the 1860s when the <strong>Confederate</strong> States of America seceded from <strong><em>the Union</em></strong> as the United States of America were then termed.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t even 50 years later that the supposed victory of the Civil War was overturned, and the Confederacy returned to power with the Federal Reserve System, which continues to print the same old southern Confederate scrip to this day, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation which was founded in the early 1900s to enforce the Christian church Mafia&#8217;s Prohibition, along with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms which was give arbitrary and absolute powers of civil asset forfeiture and property confiscation as well as establishing a comprehensive arms control list of identified &#8220;prohibited persons&#8221; who are disarmed, disenfranchised, and prohibited on the basis of mandatory fingerprinting and universal background checks for MENTAL HEALTH etc. from embarking on any sort of profitable employment or business or going to court as a plaintiff to seek redress for any such matters.</p>

				<p>@ lurker,</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t know what to think…I’d dead tired to click and adjust on EACH AND EVERY SITE those cookie settings&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I default to having both cookies and javascript off.</p>
<p>If the site still blocks, their loss, I can usually work around it without to much difficulty.</p>
<p>Take the Rupert Murdoch Empite News Corp and their desperat desperate attempts to squeeze money out of people.</p>
<p>Most of the News Corp &#8220;news&#8221; is actually stolen from other content providers by Rupert Murdochs &#8220;click-bait, cut-n-paste&#8221; excuses for journalists.</p>
<p>Thus actually finding the original source via a search engine is generally not difficult. You get the search engine to pull up a few lines of the stolen news on the News Corp site via the URL. Then if it looks interesting run that text through the search engine and low and behold another several sources pop up. Avoid the US ones and the chances are you will get the text but maybe not the photographs or pictures.</p>
<p>Yes it&#8217;s a little slower than just clicking on a News Corp link to stolen news, but&#8230; Often you find the story is not realy of interest on the retrieved text in the search engine.</p>
<p>The nonsense a few months back in Australia with News Corp is because Rupert does not want you finding out through search engines the obvious truth that he is at best a total plagiarist but more accurately a thieving old psychopathic narcissist desperate to prove he&#8217;s still relevant in a world that has long since passed him by.</p>
<p>Thus you have to &#8220;be agile&#8221; to his enfeebled luddite stompings and ravings for a time he did not require Sildenafil just to sit up in the morning&#8230;</p>

<p>Yes I kind of spotted this was going to happen the other day with the HTTPS is &#8220;climate change&#8221; nonsense, and thus called for &#8216;clean up in isle 13&#8217;.</p>
<p>But a whimsy for you to think about&#8230;</p>
<p>In your minds eye see that Trumpian 400 pounder, bashing away at it in the parental home, as an incel of their own making&#8230; Then ask the question,</p>
<p>&#8220;Would a Troll-Tools seat, smell just as unsweet by any other name?&#8221;</p>
<p>(with appologies to Shakespeare)</p>

<p>You can see the Troll-Tools so busy tootling with their horn they messed up&#8230;</p>
<p>It is ironic that the faker can not even get a simple fake right.</p>
<p>And whilst they might drink or drug themselves to death eventually as such foolish self entitaled morons do all to regularly. Their sense of the dramatic is at best prosaic, thus they never will &#8216;kill themselves for the sake of art&#8217;. Because their basic narcissism and cognative failings will prevent that as they inist on projecting their dull whit on an audiance that wished they would be &#8220;dramtic&#8221; and swan dive into a swamp somewhere.</p>
