		<h2 class="entry">Disrupting Ransomware by Disrupting Bitcoin</h2>
		<p>Ransomware isn&#8217;t new; the idea dates back to 1986 with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_(computer_virus)">&#8220;Brain&#8221; computer virus</a>. Now, it&#8217;s become <em>the</em> criminal business model of the internet for two reasons. The first is the realization that no one values data more than its original owner, and it makes more sense to ransom it back to them &#8212; sometimes with the added extortion of threatening to make it public &#8212; than it does to sell it to anyone else. The second is a safe way of collecting ransoms: bitcoin.</p>
<p>This is where the suggestion to ban cryptocurrencies as a way to &#8220;solve&#8221; ransomware comes from. Lee Reiners, executive director of the Global Financial Markets Center at Duke Law, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ban-cryptocurrency-to-fight-ransomware-11621962831">proposed this</a> in a recent <i>Wall Street Journal</i> op-ed. Journalist Jacob Silverman made the <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/162589/ban-bitcoin-cryptocurrencies-stop-hacker-ransomware">same proposal</a> in a <i>New Republic</i> essay. Without this payment channel, they write, the major ransomware epidemic is likely to vanish, since the only payment alternatives are suitcases full of cash or the banking system, both of which have severe limitations for criminal enterprises.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same problem kidnappers have had for centuries. The riskiest part of the operation is collecting the ransom. That&#8217;s when the criminal exposes themselves, by telling the payer where to leave the money. Or gives out their banking details. This is how law enforcement <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/three-men-arrested-charges-alleging-they-collected-ransom-payments-part-cross-border">tracks kidnappers down and arrests them</a>. The rise of an anonymous, global, distributed money-transfer system outside of any national control is <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/ransomware-problem-bitcoin-problem">what makes computer ransomware possible</a>.</p>
<p>This problem is made worse by the nature of the criminals. They operate out of countries that don&#8217;t have the resources to prosecute cybercriminals, like Nigeria; or protect cybercriminals that only attack outside their borders, like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russia-ransomware-cyber-crime/2021/06/11/e159e486-c88f-11eb-8708-64991f2acf28_story.html">Russia</a>; or use the proceeds as a revenue stream, like <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/north-korea-hackers-ransomware-vhd-lazarus-kaspersky">North Korea</a>. So even when a particular group is identified, it is often impossible to prosecute. Which leaves the only tools left a combination of successfully blocking attacks (another hard problem) and eliminating the payment channels that the criminals need to turn their attacks into profit.</p>
<p>In this light, banning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is an obvious solution. But while the solution is conceptually simple, it&#8217;s also impossible because &#8212; despite its <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/theres-no-good-reason-to-trust-blockchain-technology/">overwhelming</a> <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2019/presentation/weaver">problems</a> &#8212; there are so many legitimate interests using cryptocurrencies, albeit largely for speculation and not for <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/11/once-you-use-bitcoin-you-cant-go-back-and-that-irreversibility-is-its-fatal-flaw/">legal payments</a>.</p>
<p>We suggest an easier alternative: merely disrupt the cryptocurrency markets. Making them harder to use will have the effect of making them less useful as a ransomware payment vehicle, and not just because victims will have more difficulty figuring out how to pay. The reason requires understanding how criminals collect their profits.</p>
<p>Paying a ransom starts with a victim turning a large sum of money into bitcoin and then transferring it to a criminal controlled &#8220;account.&#8221; Bitcoin is, in itself, useless to the criminal. You can&#8217;t actually <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-stop-accepting-bitcoin-for-car-purchases.html">buy much</a> with bitcoin. It&#8217;s more like casino chips, only usable in a single establishment for a single purpose. (Yes, there are companies that &#8220;accept&#8221; bitcoin, but that is mostly a PR stunt.) A criminal needs to convert the bitcoin into some national currency that he can actually save, spend, invest, or whatever.</p>
<p>This is where it gets interesting. Conceptually, bitcoin combines numbered Swiss bank accounts with public transactions and balances. Anyone can create as many anonymous accounts as they want, but every transaction is posted publicly for the entire world to see. This creates some important challenges for these criminals.</p>
<p>First, the criminal needs to take efforts to conceal the bitcoin. In the old days, criminals used &#8220;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/individual-arrested-and-charged-operating-notorious-darknet-cryptocurrency-mixer&#8221;>mixing services</a>&#8220;: third parties that would accept bitcoin into one account and then return it (minus a fee) from an unconnected set of accounts. <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/">Modern bitcoin tracing</a> tools make this money laundering trick ineffective. Instead, the modern criminal does something called &#8220;chain swaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a chain swap, the criminal transfers the bitcoin to a shady <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/money-laundering-cryptocurrency-2019">offshore cryptocurrency exchange</a>. These exchanges are notoriously weak about enforcing money laundering laws and &#8212; for the most part &#8212; don&#8217;t have access to the banking system. Once on this alternate exchange, the criminal sells his bitcoin and buys some other cryptocurrency like Ethereum, Dogecoin, Tether, Monero, or one of dozens of others. They then transfer it to another shady offshore exchange and transfer it back into bitcoin. <em>Voila</em>­ &#8212; they now have &#8220;clean&#8221; bitcoin.</p>
<p>Second, the criminal needs to convert that bitcoin into spendable money. They take their newly cleaned bitcoin and transfer it to yet another exchange, one connected to the banking system. Or perhaps they <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/buried-treasure-criminals-to-go-to-extreme-lengths-to-cash-out-crypto">hire someone else</a> to do this step. These exchanges conduct greater oversight of their customers, but the criminal can use a network of bogus accounts, recruit a bunch of users to act as mules, or simply bribe an employee at the exchange to evade whatever laws there. The end result of this activity is to turn the bitcoin into dollars, euros, or some other easily usable currency.</p>
<p>Both of these steps &#8212; the chain swapping and currency conversion &#8212; require a large amount of normal activity to keep from standing out. That is, they will be easy for law enforcement to identify unless they are hiding among lots of regular, noncriminal transactions. If speculators stopped buying and selling cryptocurrencies and the market shrunk drastically, these criminal activities would no longer be easy to conceal: there&#8217;s simply too much money involved.</p>
<p>This is why disruption will work. It doesn&#8217;t require an outright ban to stop these criminals from using bitcoin &#8212; just enough sand in the gears in the cryptocurrency space to reduce its size and scope.</p>
<p>How do we do this?</p>
<p>The first mechanism observes that the criminal&#8217;s flows have a unique pattern. The overall cryptocurrency space is &#8220;zero sum&#8221;: Every dollar made was provided by someone else. And the primary legal use of cryptocurrencies involves speculation: people effectively betting on a currency&#8217;s future value. So the background speculators are mostly balanced: One bitcoin in results in one bitcoin out. There are exceptions involving offshore exchanges and speculation among different cryptocurrencies, but they&#8217;re marginal, and only involve turning one bitcoin into a little more (if a speculator is lucky) or a little less (if unlucky).</p>
<p>Criminals and their victims act differently. Victims are net buyers, turning millions of dollars into bitcoin and never going the other way. Criminals are net sellers, only turning bitcoin into currency. The only other net sellers are the cryptocurrency miners, and they are easy to identify.</p>
<p>Any banked exchange that cares about enforcing money laundering laws must consider all significant net sellers of cryptocurrencies as potential criminals and report them to both in-country and US financial authorities. Any exchange that doesn&#8217;t should have its banking forcefully cut.</p>
<p>The US Treasury can ensure these exchanges are cut out of the banking system. By designating a <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-and-regulations/311-special-measures">rogue but banked exchange</a>, the Treasury says that it is illegal not only to do business with the exchange but for US banks to <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/usa-patriot-act">do business</a> with the exchange&#8217;s bank. As a consequence, the rogue exchange would quickly find its banking options eliminated.</p>
<p>A second mechanism involves the IRS. In 2019, it started <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/court-authorizes-service-john-doe-summons-seeking-identities-us-taxpayers-who-have-used-1">demanding information</a> from cryptocurrency exchanges and added a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions">check box</a> to the 1040 form that requires disclosure from those who both buy and sell cryptocurrencies. And while this is intended to target tax evasion, it has the side consequence of disrupting those offshore exchanges criminals rely to launder their bitcoin. Speculation on cryptocurrency is far less attractive since the speculators have to pay taxes but most exchanges don&#8217;t help out by <a href="https://tokentax.co/help/what-it-means-if-you-got-a-1099-k-for-crypto-taxes/">filing 1099-Bs</a> that make it easy to calculate the taxes owed.</p>
<p>A third mechanism involves targeting the cryptocurrency Tether. While most cryptocurrencies have values that fluctuate with demand, Tether is a &#8220;stablecoin&#8221; that is supposedly backed one-to-one with dollars. Of course, it <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160905/tether-cryptocurrency-scam-enrich-bitcoin-investors">probably isn&#8217;t</a>, as its claim to be the <a href="https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/how-ransomware-criminals-are-protected-in-russia/5858722.html">seventh largest holder</a> of commercial paper (short-term loans to major businesses) is blatantly untrue. Instead, they appear part of a cycle where new Tether is issued, used to buy cryptocurrencies, and the resulting cryptocurrencies now &#8220;back&#8221; Tether and <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195066">drive up the price</a>.</p>
<p>This behavior is clearly that of a &#8220;wildcat bank,&#8221; an 1800s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoins-reliance-on-stablecoins-harks-back-to-the-wild-west-of-finance-11622115246">fraudulent banking style</a> that has long been illegal. Tether also bears a striking similarity to Liberty Reserve, an online currency that the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2013/05/29/after-liberty-reserve-shut-down-is-bitcoin-next/?sh=4838441b7412">successfully prosecuted</a> for money laundering in 2013. <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/another-cryptocurrency-target-us-regulators-tether">Shutting down Tether</a> would have the side effect of eliminating the value proposition for the exchanges that support chain swapping, since these exchanges need a &#8220;stable&#8221; value for the speculators to trade against.</p>
<p>There are further possibilities. One involves treating the cryptocurrency miners, those who validate all transactions and add them to the public record, <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/how-start-disrupting-cryptocurrencies-mining-money-transmission">as money transmitters</a> &#8212; and subject to the regulations around that business. Another option involves requiring cryptocurrency exchanges to actually deliver the cryptocurrencies into customer-controlled wallets.</p>
<p>Effectively, all cryptocurrency exchanges avoid transferring cryptocurrencies between customers. Instead, they simply <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/instant-sends">record entries</a> in a central database. This makes sense because actual &#8220;on chain&#8221; transactions can be <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee">particularly expensive</a> for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_transaction_fee">Ethereum</a>. If all speculators needed to actually receive their bitcoins, it would make clear that its value proposition as a currency simply doesn&#8217;t exist, as the <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/mempool-size">already strained system</a> would <a href="https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/stressing-out-bitcoin-stress-testing">grind to a halt</a>.</p>
<p>And, of course, law enforcement can already target criminals&#8217; bitcoin directly. An example of this just occurred, when US law enforcement was able <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/06/07/us/biden-news-today">to seize</a> 85% of the $4 million ransom Colonial Pipeline paid to the criminal organization DarkSide. That by the time the seizure occurred the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside">bitcoin lost more than 30% of its value</a> is just one more reminder of how unworkable bitcoin is as a &#8220;store of value.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no single silver bullet to disrupt either cryptocurrencies or ransomware. But enough little disruptions, a &#8220;death of a thousand cuts&#8221; through new and existing regulation, should make bitcoin no longer usable for ransomware. And if there&#8217;s no safe way for a criminal to collect the ransom, their business model becomes no longer viable.</p>

				<p>Aren&#8217;t most Bitcoin miners also going to be net sellers of cryptocurrencies?  Mining pools mean that there will be at least some transfer between the account that gets mining credit and the account that eventually sells the cryptocurrency for fiat currency.  How would you propose to disrupt the ransomware market without substantially disrupting these legitimate (at least to the first order) market participants?</p>

				<p>While this may be effective against ransomware, it misses out on non-money-driven hacking. Only more secure and resilient software and hardware will protect us from that. While it probably is harder, it would be more impactful for prevention and less disruptive for legitimate uses of cryptocurrencies.</p>

				<p>What this blog is actually describing is &#8220;Disrupting Ransomware by Disrupting Government Currency&#8221;. Essentially it wants to exploit all the problem government currency has to attack the ransomware people, which is nothing new. Ultimately, moves like these would make cryptocurrency more appealing to be used as an actual currency, because using crypto just doesn&#8217;t have these exploits.</p>

				<p><cite>How would you propose to disrupt the ransomware market without substantially disrupting these legitimate (at least to the first order) market participants?</cite><br />
But what for? The sooner the miners go out of business, the better. They drive up prices of hardware (GPUs in particular), consume huge amounts of energy adding to the global CO2 emission, and absolutely in no way make the world better. In my book, Bruce&#8217;s suggestion is hitting two birds &#8211; the hackers and the miners &#8211; with one stone.</p>

				<p>&#8216;Disrupting the Payment Channel&#8217; is the same basic tactic used by U.S. government to wage the infamous &#8216;War on Drugs&#8217; for past half century.<br />
That tactic had major unintended consequences and major disruptions to normal beneficial financial functioning.</p>
<p>In efforts to track illicit &#8216;drug money&#8217;, financial privacy is almost non-existent now for most Americans.<br />
The Federal Government tracks all credit card purchases and requires all financial institutions to report all money transfers over $10K (plus any transfers of any amount subjectively  deemed &#8216;suspicious&#8217; by any institution).<br />
These are direct violations of Constitution 4th Amendment.<br />
Police are free to seize money &amp; asses from anybody if the police subjectively feel the money might be related to illicit drug trafficking (Civil Asset Forfeiture); no legal charges or judicial due process is needed&#8211; and the police/government generally get to keep whatever they seize.<br />
Large denomination paper $$ currency was eliminated to hinder carrying large amounts of cash, at a time when inflation ravaged $$ were worth less and less.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;We suggest an easier alternative: merely disrupt the cryptocurrency market&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230; the kneejerk authoritarian approach seems an easy answer but is woefully ignorant and disdainful of basic citizen rights.</p>

				<p>Labeling net sellers as criminals will victimize long-term investors who bought cryptocurrency years ago, before the government started tracking buyers and sellers. When an investor tries to cash in, their purchase won&#8217;t be in the government&#8217;s records, so they appear as a net seller. Poof! Instant criminal.</p>
<p>Anyway, it might be possible to drive away the financially motivated criminals this way. Then it will seem like the problem is gone, even tough all the security holes remain. This will greatly please your military adversaries, who retain access to all sorts of important systems, undisturbed by the criminals, and can wreak havoc whenever they feel that the political situation calls for it.</p>
<p>The only actual solution is to start taking information security seriously.</p>

				<p>Remember not too long ago when Elon Musk tweeted that his company &#8220;Tesla&#8221; won&#8217;t be accepting BitCoin payments? Immediately after that tweet &#8211; BitCoin value went down bigly. The morale of this story is: what kind of &#8220;ripoff currency&#8221; any currency does have to be, for it to be devalued by one tweet by one Elon Musk?<br />
Why not try US$, or GBP, or Gold? Yeah, next time try Gold Mr. Musk. Why not?<br />
To clarify: the emphasis here is not on Mr. Elon Musk &#8211; I have absolutely nothing against the man whatsoever. I am merely pointing out the nature of &#8220;virtual&#8221; currencies. Hey, your money is on a server, in a cloud. Each time I think of any virtual currency, I am reminded by MC Hammer that &#8220;U Can&#8217;t Touch This&#8221;.</p>

				<blockquote><p>
  no one values data more than its original owner
</p></blockquote>
<p>While true to a large extent, the &#8220;threatening to make it public&#8221; component underscores that much of that value might only be derived from keeping the data secret.  There are countless examples of intellectual property that represent no intrinsic value to the owner, but could have <em>great</em> value to their enemies.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  the only payment alternatives are suitcases full of cash or the banking system
</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty limited thinking.  There are <em>many</em> other alternatives that a clever person could come up with to solve such a problem.  Even in just the cryptocurrency space itself there are already non-Bitcoin offerings that improve on the anonymity of transactions.</p>
<p>And the world is not static.  It&#8217;s not like criminals looking to get rich on ransomware are just going to walk away if Bitcoin becomes worthless.  Look no further than the recent rise of NFTs as a way to &#8220;legitimately&#8221; push around millions of dollars in value.  Over the next few years, you have to expect all kinds of new digital economies to spring up that criminals will find ways to weaponize.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The riskiest part of the operation is collecting the ransom.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I would more generally say it is making the <em>exchange</em>.  Both sides want to be able to get the item they value most.  There are moves and counter moves that can sour the exchange in either direction.  With cryptocurrencies (and the poor data security practiced by many organizations), the pendulum definitely has swung in favor of the attacker.  That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the right way to swing it back is to monkey with those cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Bruce, you&#8217;re pretty good about calling out people who insist on fighting the last war.  I think that&#8217;s ultimately what you&#8217;re doing here, though.  Thinking criminals are certainly already planning the move to other ways to extract money from victims.  Cryptocurrencies were just the first &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; as far as they&#8217;re concerned.</p>

				<p>Your comments on countries not going after crooks, as long as they attack outside their borders made me realize that we can classify the crooks easily, with very old names:<br />
1. the ones attacking with state support/state actors are, of course, working with a license of marque and reprisal.<br />
2. the ones that are not state supported, and only attack outside their country&#8217;s borders are cyber-coneers (aka bucconeers)<br />
3. the ones that go after everyone are, of course, cyberpirates.</p>
<p>Which suggests that an anti-malware organization should be under the Marines.</p>

				<p>More fear porn, made no doubt in coordination with big money interests interested in making more money from bitcoin.</p>
<p>Everyone who is anyone is getting into crypto, and crypto means bitcoin.  Amazon, Musk, jp morgan chase, etc.  they are all scrambling to get into the business in one way or another, either hoarding bitcoins or positioning themselves as safe harbors thereof.</p>
<p>While the latest bitcoin drop has been cyclic as expected, this &#8220;currency&#8221; is nearing its maximum capacity.  This is the last big drop there probably will be, and in comes the heavy weights.</p>
<p>They see bitcoin hasn&#8217;t faltered in its early years, and now that its on somewhat firm footing they are all trying to get in the door and reap those sweet sweet profits.  Everyone keeps talking bad about it, but behind their back they keep buying more and more of it.</p>
<p>I am not advocating anyone buy any crypto whatsoever.  But I hope one would know this is a classic example of how the rich get richer, and manipulate perceptions and markets to achieve their goals of neverending domination.</p>
<p>In the future, watch for these big banks to swoop in to &#8220;save&#8221; the bitcoin market from all this skullduggery.  Promising stability, maturity, and of course the kicker-  a huge stable of their own bitcoin to draw upon.</p>

				<p>Banning cryptocurrency and designating &#8220;rogue&#8221; exchanges both seem like overkill. Why not make it illegal for businesses to pay ransoms? Actually illegal, meaning whoever arranges the payment personally goes to jail, or gets fired and fined (for which the company or insurers may not reimburse); as opposed to making the company pay a fine that&#8217;s less than the ransom or the recovery costs. Maybe combine it with a whistleblower award, and have exchanges report as suspicious any transactions that appear to be ransoms.</p>

				<p>@ Wendell,</p>
<blockquote><p>Why not make it illegal for businesses to pay ransoms? Actually illegal, meaning whoever arranges the payment personally goes to jail, or gets fired and fined</p></blockquote>
<p>Because fourty years of experience tells us you can not make it illegal, there are just way to many ways around such measures.</p>
<p>And incidently why trying to make crypto currancy payments not work for ransom payments won&#8217;t work either.</p>
<p>People that come up with these ideas realy lack experience of the way the real world works.</p>
<p>If there is a demand a supply will arise to meet it, it realy is that simple, I know Nicholas Weaver dislikes Crypto Currancies intently and rightly considers them a scam / criminal enterprise which they are, but I thought both he and Bruce were a little more worldly wise about the way this sort of thing works.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as though I&#8217;ve not explained it more than a couple of times on this blog in the recent past.</p>
<p>Put simply all you need is some kind of legal &#8220;cut out&#8221; mechanism between those ransoming and those with ransom to pay.</p>
<p>In this case,</p>
<p>1, As a victim you contact,<br />
2, A data recovery specialist in your country,<br />
3, They in turn contact a &#8220;known&#8221; specialist in another country for you.<br />
4, Who intern &#8220;know a man&#8221; in another country who develops special recovery software.</p>
<p>The &#8220;secret sauce&#8221; for that last man actually comes from those who developed the ransomware&#8230;</p>
<p>The ransomware writers use &#8220;cryptovirology&#8221; of a form published by Adam Young and Moti Yung last century using the redundancy available in public key crypto to hide a covert system that gives us &#8220;Kleptography&#8221;.</p>
<p>It kind of works the same way the NSA back door reputed to be in the Dual EC DRNG that NIST had to de-certify and ended up in Jupiter Networks Network equipment amongst other places works.</p>
<p>The thing is that even though people have a fairly good idea they know exactly what is going on, they can not prove it. Thus with a little subterfuge and skill the paying of the Ransom becomes the legitimate full legal tax payed etc payment of &#8220;Data Recovery Services&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>And if not done this way there are dozens more legal ways to do it&#8230;</p>
<p>All that realy happens by making the payment of Ransom illegal, is you double, tripple or quadruple the actual price to the victims as you put in a string of middlemen and make it a fully legal process you can not prosecute&#8230;</p>
<p>Which is all very counter productive at the end of the day, but does ensure that the various &#8220;tax men&#8221; get a slice of the action&#8230;</p>

<p>You&#8217;re raising a lot of Cain here.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to make it &#8220;illegal&#8221; to pay blackmail or extortion ransom money then how do you propose to do this without shutting down the bitcoin exchanges and other cryptocurrency operations which facilitate the payment of ransom monies?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re working for a business, it&#8217;s already illegal, an act of embezzlement or theft to arrange payment or authorize disbursement of ransom money from the corporate treasury for unlawful purposes.</p>
<p>And how does a &#8220;whistleblower award&#8221; differ from ransom money in any significant respect? Because a dude who blows the whistle will be countersued for sexual harassment because it’s a pretty sure bet at least one lady works at whatever company that is. E.g., Julian Assange.</p>

				<p>Making ransomware payments illegal as a blanket call is not the best idea. Imagine a hospital full of covid patients seeking emergency treatment, its over crowded and people are dying. Now imagine the computer system and databases being encrypted. Doctors now cant access patient records and possibly use certain equipment. Should the patients in the hospital, through no fault of their own, have to suffer those consequences? If there are backups, they could take many days to restore. Forensic researchers would need to check the backups themselves for infection. The huge costs associated with hospitals and their time, as well as the lawsuits if something bad should happen to a patient during system downtime. Paying a ransom of a few million dollars is simply the more cost effective, timely, and ethical route in a situation like that.</p>

				<p>@petre Peters, @all</p>
<p>Ban bitcoin and all other cryptocurrency. They are a public scandal and it remains unfathomable to me why the Federal Reserve and Treasury ever allowed these scams into the public arena.</p>
<p>The problem with the &#8220;back to the tree&#8221; argument is that bitcoin is a tool that adds no social value, has no legitimate social purpose, and is nothing more than a scam to fleece money from the ignorant. This is one social experiment that never should have been tried.</p>

				<p>@ R-Squared</p>
<p>You misunderstand my opinion on the issue. It doesn&#8217;t matter to me one way or the other necessarily on which way the laws end up being written on the matter. I am simply pointing out what is likely going to happen if it hasn&#8217;t already. There are more areas aside from the hospital example that might be just as urgent of a scenario. The point im making is, are there going to be certain exemptions to a potential law stating in emergency situations a ransom can be made? If so, the organized criminals will focus on those areas knowing they will be more likely to get paid.</p>
<p>The other scenarios dont play out in terms of attempting to solve the ransomware crises through banning crypto-payments. For example, lets say we decide to go that route. Who all is going to ban it? Just the US? The US and its Allies? the entire world?  The latter likely will never happen, and if crypto is still a form of potential revenue even if banned in the US the criminals will still demand it, which in turn will lead to greater potential harm in an urgent scenario such as mentioned above. Even if all countries in the world agreed to ban crypto, at this point in time I dont think that would stop ransomware attacks. My rationale is, there has been a lot of tools and techniques, processes, craft developed in this area by the top tier malware makers those organized criminals will keep hitting businesses to test that resolve. The attacks will just be more targeted towards those more likely to pay via one way or another.</p>
<p>A ban might make it more difficult to launder the money, but some of these top tier gangs with financial experts likely know how to build some scheme in which payment could be had with little risk. At the end of the day, if billion dollar corporations have mission critical data encrypted that they need, they are going to pay that ransom one way or the other. The criminals know this. If not cryptocurrency for payment it will be something else, because the industry of making malware has already been established. Once that genie was out of the bottle, it would be very difficult to put it back in.</p>

				<p>Another point  id make is even if banning crypto did infact stop ransomware attacks, that doesnt mean the danger is over. What exactly is ransomware? A payload that encrypts data. The payload will simply be altered for another profitbale purpose. For example instead of encrypting all data on a network, it instead will ease drop on all hosts. Sucking up passwords, personal information, sensitive business details. There will still be ways for these criminals to monetize network compromise. They can sell insider information, target and blackmail CEO&#8217;s, sell credentials online, etc. The issue is network security in my opinion. Remember these organized criminals are your average thug holding up a bank. They are very smart and might have in some cases nation-state backing.</p>

				<p>In the UK gold transactions are charged VAT. Carbon taxes are badly thought through and not policed properly. Ditto the polluter pays legislation. However, thereis pressure to iprove this state of affairs at the international level. I feel this is a better direction to go in than what I read as an extra-legal business as usual police mindset in the topic article.</p>
<p>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as is are simply too dangerous to allow to continue. They are a component of a bigger system which is a planet killer. By placing Bitcoin et al on a fully legal basis out of reach of the ordinary person and taking away the glamour the fact that Bitcoin is a planet killer and with the threshold of criminality attached to it a lot of people will both socially and emotionally not be responsive. If you are caught creating it or using or trading in it you will be of the level of people making VX gas, wife beating, and drunk driving. If you were a CEO of a major company would you pay a ransom in cocaine? John Delorean got caught up in something similar when he had business financial worries and we know Mark Thatcher supported a coup in Africa (he is banned from travelling to the US) so we know people can do ill-judged things but this is not routine and amateurs at these kinds of things usually come unstuck.</p>
<p>Good luck finding a country which will allow you to connect to their electricty grid if they&#8217;re going to get their power plants bombed from 50,000 feet.</p>
<p>Progressive, fair, and human rights and environment aware policies are be the future. I anticipate the charge of genocide will get some peoples attention because we are potentially at that point.</p>
<p>In the UK laws already exist for HMRC to conduct investigations on mere suspicion and lean on you in unpleasant ways. I personally think this is an abuse of law but we are where we are. There is also precedent for prosecuting activities which fall under a &#8220;dual purpose&#8221; defence such as ISP&#8217;s peddling download X music tracks in Y minutes when you buy Z capacity. Yes, I have gone full circle and turned myself into a hypocrite in the process. I&#8217;ll leave lawyers to tidy it up and police forces to decide how they implement things but yes I feel bitcon et al must be banned and not just banned but made beyond the pale like a lot of bad government and corporate practice and tawdry behavior. The world we live in and our futures depend on it.</p>

				<p>Lol, yes more laws taking away freedoms will have no negative or unintended consequences. Some smart people can be so dumb. You&#8217;ve persuaded me that I need to start acquiring monero (or similar) immediately to escape your financial Orwellian nightmare world.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  In the UK gold transactions are charged VAT.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So that&#8217;s 20% VAT when you <em>purchase</em> gold as an investment.</p>
<p>And if you ever do manage to sell it at a profit or recoup your investment, you owe Capital Gains Tax on any proceeds in excess of your original investment.</p>
<p>hxxps://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the VAT effectively prevents British subjects from purchasing gold at a reasonable cost for investment or trading purposes in the first place.</p>
<p>So much for the (in)famous &#8220;London Gold Fix&#8221; then — the world commodities and precious metals markets are irredeemably rigged — which they confess outright as &#8220;fixing&#8221; the price with no apology.</p>

				<p>@ R-Squared,</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’re going to make it “illegal” to pay blackmail or extortion ransom money then how do you propose to do this without shutting down the bitcoin exchanges and other cryptocurrency operations which facilitate the payment of ransom monies?</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess the same way we make bribes illegal, for example, without forbidding cash. Anyone caught doing it gets in serious trouble. A relevant question, then, would be whether the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the like actually work. They certainly bring in money, but do they deter the behavior they&#8217;re meant to?</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’re working for a business, it’s already illegal, an act of embezzlement or theft to arrange payment or authorize disbursement of ransom money from the corporate treasury for unlawful purposes.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not accurate. It would only be theft or embezzlement if done without the permission of one&#8217;s employer. It&#8217;s well known that large businesses have paid ransoms without legal punishment. In fact, <a href="https://duo.com/decipher/fbi-okays-paying-in-a-ransomware-attack" rel="nofollow ugc">the FBI is sometimes fine with people paying ransom</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>And how does a “whistleblower award” differ from ransom money in any significant respect? Because a dude who blows the whistle&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that comment went off the rails at the end&#8230;.</p>
<p>The SEC is an example of an agency that rewards people who report illegal behavior, such as bribing foreign officials. Companies caught retaliating against such people would face additional trouble. Rewards are different than ransom or bribery because the money would not go to criminals. The whole point of forbidding ransom payments would be to disrupt the flow of money to criminals, similar to what Bruce and Nicholas propose. How could a large company make a ransom payment and keep it secret if all the everyone involved knows that they can get a fat government check by turning on the company? And if large companies can&#8217;t make payments, why would ransomware users waste time spear-phishing them?</p>
<p>Clive is right, of course, that the payments won&#8217;t actually stop. Companies do illegal shit all the time. Small businesses would still be able to get away with making illegal payments—a sole proprietor in a cash business could siphon the money (not nearly as much money, though), and as long as they don&#8217;t cheat on their taxes, wouldn&#8217;t much have to worry about some financial auditor catching them 10 years in the future. Easy enough to keep a secret when it&#8217;s a conspiracy of one. Large businesses, though, would have to consider the risks of being caught, and the extra costs of such might make ransom payments less attractive than rebuilding. It&#8217;s all about incentives.</p>

				<p>I could go either way on this one. If we don&#8217;t get rid of cryptocurrency we gain in offering very costly and unwanted penetration testing for lots of corporations and government offices. On the other hand getting rid of cryto will help tremendously with energy demands, and will take out a big sector of online crime. So yeah, great benefits to both. I&#8217;m fine with either option.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  It’s well known that large businesses have paid ransoms without legal punishment.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That does not mean they are not breaking the law. Most businesses are incorporated &#8220;for any lawful purpose&#8221; which does not include financing extortion rackets or operating the business as a front for other organized criminal activity.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In fact, the FBI is sometimes fine with people paying ransom.
</p></blockquote>
<p>They&#8217;re <em>supposed to</em> investigate any serious violations of law in their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>If people are going to pay ransom or patronize protection rackets, they&#8217;d better have plans in place to catch those violent criminals and recover the ransom money when the crooks have performed their end of the contract or delivered on their promises.</p>
<p>But of course that doesn&#8217;t happen in real life, because the long-running undercover operations typical of the FBI, DEA, ATF and other government agencies inevitably succumb to the vices of the very organized crime they are purportedly intended to stop.</p>

				<p>What a terrible idea. Ransomware incentivizes the improvement of cybersecurity through relatively minor service interruptions. If ransomware is eliminated through ways other than improving cybersecurity, the holes will remain unplugged and will grow. At some point there will inevitably be an attack and unlike ransomware it won&#8217;t come with an offer to pay for service restoration. Ransomware is the wake up call we need to correct the course of agencies like the NSA that have prioritized their own attack and surveillance capabilities over the protection of critical infrastructure from foreign adversaries. I think essays like this that plant the idea in people&#8217;s heads that ransomware can be solved without improving security are dangerous and set us up for a 9/11 size attack.</p>

				<p>I think the Powers that Be are already bavfew steps ahead of the reasoning applied here.</p>
<p>The foundations of the policies in the works are that bitcoin streams are transparent and that banks are applying Know Your Customer and Anti Money Laundering legislation quite rigorously.</p>
<p>The new cryptocurrency rules require all exchanges to follow KYC rules. Any Bitcoin that cannot be traced back to a KYC account is blacklisted and no exchange or bank will touch it.</p>
<p>This means that any Bitcoin exchanged for Fiat money without KYC will from that moment be useless in the regulated banking system and any bank, exchange or company touching it will be blacklisted itself.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ransomware is the wake up call we need to correct the course of agencies like the NSA&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>What we realy need is something to correct the course of the corporations like Microsoft et al that produce the shoddy cruft in the first place.</p>
<p>If we could get them to behave to even the minimum standards of others who sell other consumer items for &#8220;merchantability and fitness for purpose&#8221; then many many of the ills that we suffer from would not be happening.</p>
