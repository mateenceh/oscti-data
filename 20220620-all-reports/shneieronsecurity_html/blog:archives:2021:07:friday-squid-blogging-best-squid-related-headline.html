<blockquote><p>Videos circulating on TikTok that show British teenagers sharing tips and tricks for faking positive Covid tests to get out of school have been viewed millions of times.</p></blockquote>
<p>The little blighters! That said some of the more hardline scientists aren&#8217;t happy with how the UK government handled the pandemic or children returning to school sans vaccinations. I&#8217;m undecided which way to take this one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/02/mps-condemn-social-media-firms-chris-whitty-death-threats" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/02/mps-condemn-social-media-firms-chris-whitty-death-threats</a></p>
<p>Social media companies have been accused of “taking their eye off the ball” over online death threats against public servants such as Prof Chris Whitty after he became the focus of violent language in channels set up by anti-lockdown activists and members of the far right.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned before there are members of the Tory party who are far right and view the Tory party as a &#8220;soft touch&#8221;. They are not slow to use genocidal type language or death threats. The wave of terrorist and extremist action taking place within the UK, Europe, and the US as well as this more targetted action by far right anti-vaxxers fits in with this overall pattern.</p>
<p>The description they have of themselves of &#8220;common law policemen&#8221; whiffs of Ye Olde England Magna Carta mythology worshipping brownshirt vigilante&#8217;s.</p>

				<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/twitter-considers-new-features-for-tweeting-only-to-friends-under-different-personas-and-more/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/twitter-considers-new-features-for-tweeting-only-to-friends-under-different-personas-and-more/</a></p>
<blockquote><p>With the proposed Trusted Friends feature, users could tweet to a group of their own choosing. This could be a way to use Twitter with real-life friends, or some other small network of people you know more personally. Perhaps you could post a tweet that only your New York friends could see when you wanted to let them know you were in town. Or maybe you could post only to those who share your love of a particular TV show, sporting event or hobby.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The third, and perhaps most complicated, feature is something Twitter is calling “Facets.”</p>
<p>This is an early idea about tweeting from different personas from one account. The feature would make sense for those who often tweet about different aspects of their lives, including their work life, their side hustles, their personal life or family, their passions and more.</p>
<p>Unlike Trusted Friends, which would let you restrict some tweets to a more personal network, Facets would give other users the ability to choose whether they wanted to follow all your tweets, or only those about the “facet” they’re interested in. This way, you could follow someone’s tweets about tech, but ignore their stream of reactions they post when watching their favorite team play. Or you could follow your friend’s personal tweets, but ignore their work-related content. And so on.</p>
<p>This is an interesting idea, as Twitter users have always worried about alienating some of their followers by posting “off-topic” so to speak. But this also puts the problem of determining what tweets to show which users on the end user themselves. Users may be better served by the algorithmic timeline that understands which content they engage with, and which they tend to ignore. (Also: “facets‽”)</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how this will work in practice and it isn&#8217;t an exact clone but this isn&#8217;t unlike the scheme I proposed a few weeks ago of a network of trust and aliases with a common root. Twitter is managing it within their own platform which comes with its own skews and, of course, it&#8217;s really only a local system to them not a global system capable of being used across the entire network. Twitter have the root and alias links which they would otherwise not have access to.</p>

<blockquote><p>Children are always going to find cunning ways to bunk off school, and the latest trick is to fake a positive COVID-19 lateral flow test (LFT) using soft drinks. So how are fruit juices, cola and devious kids fooling the tests and is there a way to tell a fake positive result from a real one? I’ve tried to find out.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Is there then a way to spot a fake positive test? The antibodies (like most proteins) are capable of refolding and regaining their function when they are returned to more favourable conditions. So I tried washing a test that had been dripped with cola with buffer solution, and sure enough the immobilised antibodies at the T-line regained normal function and released the gold particles, revealing the true negative result on the test.</p>
<p>Children, I applaud your ingenuity, but now that I’ve found a way to uncover your trickery I suggest you use your cunning to devise a set of experiments and test my hypothesis. Then we can publish your results in a peer-reviewed journal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Smug &#8220;certified professional&#8221; forgets that the fake was A.) Good enough to fool the test and B.) Discovered by children yapping on TikTok.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/03/allowing-people-in-england-with-covid-both-jabs-to-skip-quarantine-will-cause-resentment" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/03/allowing-people-in-england-with-covid-both-jabs-to-skip-quarantine-will-cause-resentment</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Allowing those who have received two doses of a Covid vaccine to skip quarantine could breed resentment and result in mass non-compliance, a scientific adviser has warned.</p>
<p>Downing Street has confirmed it is looking at whether to drop all legal self-isolation measures for fully vaccinated people who come into contact with someone who is infected “as part of the post-step 4 world”.</p>
<p>It comes after the Times reported that a meeting of the Covid operations committee would take place on Monday at which ministers are expected to sign off a plan that will mean those who have been double-jabbed will be “advised”, after 19 July, to take daily tests but not be required to do so.</p>
<p>Robert West, a professor in health psychology at University College London’s Institute of Epidemiology and Health, told Times Radio he could “see the rationale” for the policy, but that there were significant problems that “outweigh potential benefits”.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>However, Dr Bharat Pankhania, a senior clinical lecturer in communicable diseases at the University of Exeter’s medical school, said he thought it was “perfectly OK” for people who had received two doses of a coronavirus vaccine to be exempt from quarantine measures.</p>
<p>He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The gold standard would be to be cautious even if you have been immunised twice – in other words, fully immunised.</p>
<p>“However, as a measured action going forward I think it is OK and my reasons are as follows: an immunised person is less infectious and furthermore, the testing of people who are in quarantine isolating is pretty inaccurate. So balancing both, I think it is perfectly OK.”</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>West warned infection rates were “getting out of control”, and that the discussion was “a bit of a distraction” from rising case numbers.</p>
<p>“The hope is that of course that it won’t reach the levels that we saw in January, but it doesn’t have to, because the NHS has already been so badly hit, and the staff are so stressed now,” he said.</p>
<p>“We have to catch up on routine [treatments], so it wouldn’t take a lot for the NHS to be very severely affected.”</p>
<p>[&#8230;]The British Medical Association said that keeping some protective measures in place after 19 July was “crucial” to stop spiralling case numbers having a “devastating impact” on people’s health, the NHS, the economy and education.</p></blockquote>
<p>Having put myself in near complete lockdown since day one and still maintaining &#8220;high assurance&#8221; levels of safety I am very very deliberately not using the NHS test and trace application for a number of reasons. Having had both vaccines one of those reasons is if I don&#8217;t use it I won&#8217;t have it flag me as potentially infected if I walk past someone who is. I&#8217;m not having my life turned upside down any more than it is.</p>
<p>I stupidly brought the second jab forward by one week from 12 weeks to 11 weeks because the government was hustling people due to the young getting impatient efficacy dropped from 90% to 70%. I discovered both of these items a few days afterwards.</p>
<p>I would like everyone to note the word &#8220;advise&#8221; in this article very very closely. The word &#8220;advice&#8221; is not dropped in there by accident. This is the microscopic tip of an extremely large legal iceberg. What this means is A.) You can listen to whichever doctor you want or completely ignore them. B.) Doctors are a stack of unexamined policies and practices with varying degrees of expertise someonetimes informed by third parties and they cannot always for a consensus of uncertain provenance among themselves and C.) It&#8217;s on you.</p>
<p>The word  &#8220;advise&#8221; isn&#8217;t just there to get the government off the hook for making a &#8220;sovereign decison&#8221; based on &#8220;informed consent&#8221; but also a legal device to get them off the hook for legal action should anything go wrong one way or another.</p>
<p>This gets more and more murky the deeper you dig. The government is both legally insulating itself and has a habit of legally insulating itself from lots of other unrelated policy areas for quite some time. It is also aggressively managing the news to maintain a higher perceived competence and consent and to disguise disagreement and anger with below &#8220;gold standard&#8221; governance across a range of public policy areas. I have noted in previous comments the issue of far right activity and also throwing disabled people under the bus. These are just two indicators of a failure of governance and breaching of consensus and failure of government to act to fulfill its legal obligations with respect to security of the state and the people. I have also posted links revealing how ministers evade accountability although these only go so far.</p>
<p>I had another meeting with the lawyer yesterday. The meeting didn&#8217;t go as planned but it went better than I hoped. I cannot discuss details for obvious reasons but a range of law was discussed from building legal instruments to touching on public law. Having had previous experience of catching a minister lying to the House and being in the uncomfortable position of being caught by the Official Secrets Act, and experience of Whitehall mandarins acting as a buffer of deniability between ministers and institutionalised money laundering by the City I have some idea how tricky these things can be.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting at times how blurred the lines are between state and citizen are with respect to the roles of intelligence analyst and spy, and how ministers and agents of the state may be the cuckoo in the nest. But this gets into a philosophical discussion of what is the &#8220;state&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is notable in law in matters political the people are sovereign.</p>

				<p>@Clive,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad, I try to not be so serious but the other thread I was starting to sound like a pitchfork wielding maniac. Related to your comment and my comment was something I omitted about my frustration which is that I may still be upset about OPM.</p>
<p>Deeply.</p>
<p>Earlier, in an hn thread I avoided posting here due to multiple fronts of congestion (moderate review) a couple people mentioned that nobody remembers OPM.</p>
<p>Which I gather may be our latent cynicism smiling brightly across these here intarwebs.</p>
