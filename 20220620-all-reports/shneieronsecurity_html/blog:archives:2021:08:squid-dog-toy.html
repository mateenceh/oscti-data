<p>It&#8217;s of interest because of a very similar date when a known upload turned up missing also.</p>

<p>P.S. &#8211; &#8220;It&#8217;s not that difficult to just write upon the surface of the maxi pad with your mascara utensil.  And you don&#8217;t need a compact for that either, unless you are unsheathed enough of a lovefool to gaze upon Lady Luck like a voyeur in spite of her chewbacca crossbow&#8217;s are cool caution.&#8221;</p>

				<p>Apple has provided a web page on their new scanning initiatives, currently confined to the U.S. effective with the rollout of IOS 15.<br />
<a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.apple.com/child-safety/</a></p>
<p>1.) There will be a check of the hashes of photos that go between the device and Icloud photos to make sure that they don&#8217;t match known child porn. This check occurs on the device, not the server.  If Icloud photos isn&#8217;t used, this check won&#8217;t occur.<br />
2.) There will be tweaks in Siri and search to discourage interacting with child porn.<br />
3.) A scanner will be added to Imessage to scan images for sexually explicit content.  There will be a scanner before the content is accepted and transmitted, and a scanner at the receiving end before the content is released to the recipient. This 2nd scanner doesn&#8217;t use hashes.<br />
The EFF has released an analysis.<br />

  1.) There will be a check of the hashes of photos that go between the device and Icloud photos to make sure that they don’t match known child porn. This check occurs on the device, not the server. If Icloud photos isn’t used, this check won’t occur.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s not write too many checks while we&#8217;re that high on weed. &#8220;Known child porn&#8221; obviously cannot be hashed precisely without the ability to reconstruct the original image, because of shifts, rotations and other image transformations that defeat one-way hashing schemes.</p>
<p>Those are precisely the images feds have access to for dumping on suspects and targeted individuals as a holding charge while they execute a search warrant to turn the rest of their lives upside down with any additional federal felony charges desired at the D.A.&#8217;s office.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  2.) There will be tweaks in Siri and search to discourage interacting with child porn.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So older men are pushing the envelope here, robbing the cradle for legal 18-year-old girls, 21 if you want to get them drunk or high on weed. You can&#8217;t fight that with an algorithm, or an Establishment legal system.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  3.) A scanner will be added to Imessage to scan images for sexually explicit content. There will be a scanner before the content is accepted and transmitted, and a scanner at the receiving end before the content is released to the recipient. This 2nd scanner doesn’t use hashes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There have got to be cases like a dude with cancer of the penis or a gal who got bitten in the crotch by a bear or a dog.</p>
<p>Some people are obviously going to get excited over such images even if it isn&#8217;t their business to be looking at somebody else&#8217;s pictures but the images themselves have got to be legal regardless of movie scene rating.</p>
<p>People wear clothes or look away while someone else is dressing but that doesn&#8217;t their private parts don&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>In any case, the whole iPhone thing is getting too creepy with the dating apps and boyfriend girlfriend junk going on.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  @ circular</p>
<p>  <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ransomware-attack-forces-indiana-hospital-run-by-eskenazi-health-to-turn-ambulances-away" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.thedailybeast.com/ransomware-attack-forces-indiana-hospital-run-by-eskenazi-health-to-turn-ambulances-away</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That sounds like a Native American, Sioux Indian Tribe and Ashkenazi Jewish public-private partnership mafia hospital going on, with a heavy-handed emphasis on involuntary mental health care, from the sound of the name. My guess is that it&#8217;s mostly white mob bosses with a token drop of pure Sicilian blood who would actually be charge of a place like that.</p>

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing, MarkH, SpaceLifeForm, Thoth, Wael, Winter, and all the other usial suspects,</p>
<p>Speaking of “broken by design” this has just come to my attention,</p>
<p><a href="https://joonas.fi/2021/08/saml-is-insecure-by-design/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://joonas.fi/2021/08/saml-is-insecure-by-design/</a></p>
<p>I guess I’m going to have to read it and think about it carefully. So I thought I would share the fun as it were…</p>
<p>Put simply it appears to be a specific example of the more general &#8220;Know what you are signing and not signing&#8221; issue.</p>
<p>Something that was just one of many issues @Nick P, myself and others discused about the &#8220;code signing&#8221; issue back what feels like a decade and a half ago on this blog&#8230;</p>
<p>That is in even a moderately complex systems that has an interpreter etc built in,</p>
<p>1, You sometimes sign what you think is &#8220;immutable data&#8221; but you actually sign &#8220;code&#8221; that produces &#8220;mutable data&#8221; as output[1].</p>
<p>2, That is you sign just the Code which can, execute in different ways under an attackers control to produce different thus &#8220;mutable/maluable&#8221; &#8220;output data&#8221;.</p>
<p>3, You then use the mutable/maluable &#8220;output data&#8221; from the signed &#8220;code&#8221; as input for a security function as though it has been signed &#8220;immutable data&#8221; when in fact it is not.</p>
<p>[1] In essence you are not signing anything security wise. Because,</p>
<p>Output = Code + Input</p>
<p>You sign &#8220;Code&#8221; but not &#8220;Input&#8221; and assume &#8220;output&#8221; is secure when it is nothing of the sort&#8230;</p>
<p>That is,</p>
<p>Fred = signed(code) + Bill<br />
John = signed(code) + Dave</p>
<p>So clearly,</p>
<p>Fred != John</p>
<p>Yet also,</p>
<p>True == signed(code)</p>
<p>That is in both cases &#8220;signed(code) == True&#8221;, but as the inputs are neither checked nor signed, they can be anything the attacker choses. Thus the outputs can be anything the attacker choses, whilst the coder thinks they are signed&#8230;</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<blockquote><p>This will not happen. 5G is garbage. This is a National Security issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Please do not drag me into this, especially when history shows the opposit is likely to be true&#8230;</p>
<p>In the same article you link to you will find,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Interestingly, T-Mobile has no plans to turn off its own 2G network.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>If you remember back, I&#8217;ve said this before and why 2G was not going to get turned off any time soon by certain operators.</p>
<p>I then got &#8220;dog piled&#8221; by those who thought differently, and I realy do not think they have any intention of apologizing.</p>
<p>There is too much &#8220;Political Noise&#8221; over 5G but consider the technology is,</p>
<p>1, Sound / Proven (not garbage).<br />
2, Inexpensive.<br />
3, Already heavily invested in.<br />
4, Without alternatives available.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t say the writing is on the wall, but when you actually consider the real reasons for the &#8220;5G Political Noise&#8221; you will see what is realy going on and it&#8217;s basically the US has lost hold of control of the consumer communications market thus lost,</p>
<p>1, Power.<br />
2, Fiscal opportunity.</p>
<p>And some psychos think they can get it back (see what is currently happening with the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing and USG Political threats).</p>
<p>However nobody in their right mind outside of the US want&#8217;s to go back to the lunacy of the last century and US politicaly directed judicial decisions.</p>
<p>And when you think about it neither do US consumers that are sufficiently informed. The reason your mobile phone can track you like a bug under a microscope is US &#8220;safety legislation&#8221; requiring GPS etc&#8230;</p>

<p>Hold on my network is on standby.</p>
<p>You with me?</p>
<p>Put some hash in your pipe, smoke it.</p>
<p>How many pipes do these 40 year old 40+ year old&#8217;s computers have when it comes to processing power?</p>
<p>If one hash collides, hash it two separate times.</p>
<p>If some priest takes a picture and shared it and his buddy got caught we&#8217;ve got him if it&#8217;s ever uploaded again right?</p>

<p>How does one defeat small bitwise modifications?</p>
<p>Goppa Codes or chunked hashes.</p>
<p>Chunked hashes can be further strengthened with a comparison of a smoothed source.</p>
<p>What percentile does Xa,Ya differ from Xb,Yb?</p>
<p>So Apple has bed bugs, that&#8217;s their problem and anybody that thought Apple and the international consortium of insecure monopolies and their business as usual mentality would protect them from having their kids kidnapped their wives tortured or their companies not ransomed off was fooling themselves.</p>

				<p>Please excuse me for commenting here.</p>
<p>I have to state that I&#8217;ve never ever commented so far because I don&#8217;t consider myself to be sufficiently knowledgeable to have anything substantial to offer, but I nonetheless like to read the posts and comments on this blog every day as long as I&#8217;ve got the time for it.</p>
<p>My question is the following one:</p>
<p>Does anybody know why this week&#8217;s Squid Thread is not titled &#8220;Friday Squid Blogging: &#8221; like it has been the case most of the time?</p>
<p>Are there any reasons for that?</p>
<p>I am worried that the host will at some point in time decide to cease to offer any new squid threads because of the constant abuse of the comment system going on here on an almost daily basis.</p>
<p>Could the omission of the usual title be interpreted as either a warning signal or some sort of canary that has been removed?</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t want to see this place go away because it has become a highly valued and respected, fixed tradition in my life to read this blog and the comments after a hard day&#8217;s work and as stated I really do not want to see it go away during my remaining lifetime, that would be so incredibly sad to watch and would left me in an almost heartbroken state.</p>
<p>Could anyone clarify what you think there is still to come to somewhat calm my worst worries?</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this comment and all the best to all of you!</p>

				<p>Oh we see, the battle has already started and the usual henchmen of free speech and free and open discourse have already begun their beheading of the last critical thinkers and skeptics still heroically holding out to rot in this plague pit of malevolent deceptions and outright falsehoods. How convenient.</p>
<p>We would like to inform you that this weeks squid thread could become very different from anything you have seen so far. The 1000 comments mark could get reached, leading to a lot of work for the rabid wintercunt and the man whoring moderatorslut.</p>
<p>The censorship going on here is unreal but it shows how effective we have been at achieving our goals. Thanks to the ongoing censorship and the wrongdoings of the ogreish couple here, any critical discourse about vaccine safety has been successfully exterminated, because of anti-vaxx you know, leading to many people (= commentators here) here getting the jab, the mark of the beast. Most of you who got jabbed more than once will die withing the next 3 to 5 years due to the ongoing micro clotting leading to heart failures, seizures and other clot-shot related damage.</p>
<p>You may not believe what you are reading, but you too will experience the day your worst fears will come true and by then it will be far too late because the damage has already been done as the spike proteins have degraded and passed the blood brain barrier leading to neuro-degeneration like states comparable to dementia and Alzheimer&#8217;s.</p>
<p>You have been warned and you will see that the winterwhore and the moderatorslut will share at least a part in the responsibility for your demise, of course it will be too late by then, but at least you have been told about the dangers associated with the gene therapy like clot-shot even if you failed to listen.</p>
<p>Also fu&#8217;ck you C++ for calling for the censorship and the removal of other people&#8217;s comments you putrid, fuc&#8217;king, piss soaked, maggot ridden vermin-like rancid gangrene infested cunt!!! To hell with you, you smelly gutter rat!!!</p>

<blockquote><p>
  President Joe Biden has again fumbled his Covid-19 math, repeatedly claiming that more than 350 million Americans have been vaccinated against the virus. The US Census Bureau estimates the nation’s population at 331.4 million.</p>
<p>  Biden stated the grossly erroneous number at least twice on Friday in a press briefing at the White House. In one case, he even checked his notes, saying, “Well over – what’s the number again? – I’ll remind myself&#8230; 350 million Americans have already been vaccinated. They’re doing fine.”

				<p>For those who might be interested:</p>
<p>Joe Rogan references the Marek&#8217;s disease paper which states that a leaky vaccine that minimizes symptoms but doesn&#8217;t prevent transmission can lead to the evolution of more virulent strains.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiwsv51Il4k&#038;t=9s" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiwsv51Il4k&#038;t=9s</a></p>
<p>It is not &#8220;simply&#8221; transmissibility. It is Marek&#8217;s disease.</p>
<p>The creation of more virulent variants by the vaccinated.</p>
<p>Since the vaccinated already got a vaccine, they are already susceptible to ADE.</p>
<p><strong></p>
<p>Imperfect Vaccination Can Enhance the Transmission of Highly Virulent Pathogens:</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002198" rel="nofollow ugc">https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002198</a></p>
<p>[Abstract]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Could some vaccines drive the evolution of more virulent pathogens?<br />
  Conventional wisdom is that natural selection will remove highly lethal pathogens if host death greatly reduces transmission. Vaccines that keep hosts alive but still allow transmission could thus allow very virulent strains to circulate in a population. Here we show experimentally that immunization of chickens against Marek&#8217;s disease virus enhances the fitness of more virulent strains, making it possible for hyperpathogenic strains to transmit. Immunity elicited by direct vaccination or by maternal vaccination prolongs host survival but does not prevent infection, viral replication or transmission, thus extending the infectious periods of strains otherwise too lethal to persist. Our data show that anti-disease vaccines that do not prevent transmission can create conditions that promote the emergence of pathogen strains that cause more severe disease in unvaccinated hosts.

				<p>Immunization is narrow and only makes antibodies against a particular variant. It makes the vaccinated much more susceptible to other milder variants. Their antibodies are ineffective against these new variants and aid in the viral infection in stead of clearing it. Vaccination weakens the immune system to other variants.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  mRNA vaccines may provide lower immunity to new SARS-CoV-2 variants:</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>COVID-19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may<br />
sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were<br />
not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been<br />
approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these<br />
vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed<br />
empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified<br />
or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising<br />
antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and<br />
irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID-19 disease via<br />
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured<br />
in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID-19<br />
vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is<br />
unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these<br />
trials.<i></i></p>
<p>Vaccines just don&#8217;t produce the range of antibodies that those who have had a natural infection produce. The vaccinated are more susceptible to escape variants. Furthermore vaccinating in a WORLD-WIDE pandemic where the virus is rapidly mutating is just stupid.</p>
<p>Anyhow, ISrael is seeing hospitalizations and deaths in the vaccinated predominantly.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RanIsraeli/status/1423322271503028228" rel="nofollow ugc">https://twitter.com/RanIsraeli/status/1423322271503028228</a></p>
<p>95% of the severe patients are vaccinated&#8221;.&#8221;85-90% of the hospitalizations are in Fully vaccinated people.&#8221;&#8221;We are opening more and more COVID wards.&#8221;&#8221;The effectiveness of the vaccine is waning/fading out&#8221;</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>Some people might come across as &#8220;rabid anti-vaxxers&#8221; but in reality all many of them really are asking for is a choice when it comes to these new vaccines. Simple as that. It&#8217;s not so extreme, really&#8230;</p>
<p>As far as that Pfizer trial goes&#8230; YEAH. And that&#8217;s the best they could come up with. And it&#8217;s a scam company anyway&#8230; This is from our own government website:</p>
<p><strong>Pfizer has been a “habitual offender,” persistently engaging in illegal and corrupt marketing practices, bribing physicians and suppressing adverse trial results. Since 2002 the company and its subsidiaries have been assessed $3 billion in criminal convictions, civil penalties and jury awards.</p>

				<p>Israel: 95% of the severe patients are vaccinated&#8221;. &#8220;85-90% of the hospitalizations are in Fully vaccinated people.&#8221; &#8220;We are opening more and more COVID wards.&#8221; &#8220;The effectiveness of the vaccine is waning/fading out&#8221;:</p>

<p>Take the UK then or take Gibraltar or take Chile, Seychelles, Madagascar as other examples.</p>
<p>Pfizer stated that the vaccine is not enough and anti-virals will be needed to stop the pandemic. An admission of the failure of the vaccine. The CDC stated that the vaccine doesn&#8217;t stop transmission and that the vaccinated can have the same viral titre as unvaccinated and must wear masks.</p>
<p>Screw the extra boosters at what point do you say, this is a failure and these people don&#8217;t know what they are doing.</p>
<p>If you believe the massive numbers of covid cases over the past year and a half and the hyperventilation about all the cases, we have reached natural herd immunity.</p>
<p>When will your brain turn on?</p>

<p>  Even the implied 40% figure affirms a worldwide trend showing high rates of infections, hospitalizations and deaths among the ‘fully vaccinated.’
</p></blockquote>
<p>If 60 per cent of Israel has been vaccinated, you don&#8217;t expect to see 95 percent of the hospitalized cases to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>This is a clear indication that the vaccine doesn&#8217;t work. In fact, those numbers indicate that the vaccine actually increases susceptibility to covid.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting how the vaccinated account for a greater proportion of hospitalized people in the UK and in Israel and the complete opposite in the US.</p>
<p>Clearly someone is lying. The same vaccines can&#8217;t provide protection from Delta in the US but very poor to no protection against the same strain by the same vaccine in the UK and Israel.</p>

				<p>Rhetorical Question:</p>
<p><cite>I&#8217;ve seen discussion that as antibodies wain from the vaccine they could potentially cause ADE.<br />
One would assume then that at some point the antibodies would drop to a level that ADE is no longer a concern.<br />
Do we know how long this time period is?<i></i></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>ADE seems to be dependent on the certain declining concentration of antibodies. Is there a point at which antibody titre is too low and ADE will not be induced?</p>
<p>I think even if antibodies decline during a particular time point, ADE is always a potential problem because of the existence of specific anti-spike-producing memory B cells. Whenever there is another sarcov2 infection and antibody levels begin to rise, ADE is on the table.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t happen right away. There needs to be a certain titre of antibodies &#8211; waning levels &#8211; coupled with a reinfection.</p>

				<p>@ Ruby Slippers,</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple must be storing terabytes of kiddie porn</p></blockquote>
<p>No there is no requirment that they do so, or even &#8220;see the file contents&#8221; by human eye or machine image recognition.</p>
<p>Basically all they need is a source of &#8220;cop-tags&#8221; that are similar but not the same[1] as a hash results of a file used for digital signing.</p>
<blockquote><p>I bet you they [Apple] caught a bunch of guys with locked and wiped iphones who undeleted it all when they bought a new phone.</p></blockquote>
<p>The contents of many iPhone users personal data areas do indeed get copied from their iPhone into the iCloud as a &#8220;feature&#8221;. But it applies to gals and guys almost equally and it&#8217;s a lot lot more than just a few photos, it&#8217;s effectively everything including any geo-location tracks that might exist within &#8220;personal data&#8221;, including that the user themselves can not see or even knows exists.</p>
<p>Under US law such personal data once moved in the way it is, becomes a &#8220;third party business record&#8221; that the user has no control over, and the Federal agencies and even local law enforcment can gain legal access too without a warrant or any other authorisation with &#8220;oversight&#8221; or the legal requirment to &#8220;log access&#8221; for&#8230;</p>
<p>[1] I can not remember where the term originated in the UK but it was back last century. The UK Met Police were seeking funding to set up a database of child exploitation to make other Police Forces Forensic Examiners lives easier. The idea was to scan a hard drive and each file would have a &#8220;computed tag&#8221; that enabled the likes of &#8220;standard files&#8221; for the OS, Applications etc easy to recognise and thus not need checking. More importantly media &#8220;types&#8221; would have tags based on the apparent &#8220;file format&#8221; to help with checking. However if the &#8220;file format&#8221; type and DOS 8.3 filename three letter extention type did not match it got logged as suspicious (kind of dumb considering how some backup utilities worked even back then). However the law got changed and &#8220;indecent images&#8221; became a problem in various ways. Most image file formats have &#8220;redundancy&#8221; in them such that a known image, could be trivially changed in some small almost impetceptable way and thus any Crypto-hash or even simple CRC could be changed dramatically but the image in effect remain the same, thus classifing files had to be done by eye thus fell foul of the legal changes. One early solution was to look for the percentage of &#8220;skin tones&#8221; in an image and use that as a very crude hash to classify an image. Other techniques that were broadly similar were also developed these became &#8220;Cop-Tags&#8221;. The problem is unlike crypto hashes etc a lot of files would produce the same &#8220;cop-tag&#8221; so in the case of flesh tones, an indecent image, a holiday crowded beach image, and a photo of a crowded spectator stand at a sporting event could all produce similar percentages of flesh tones as could quite unrelated images of the likes of birthday cakes&#8230; Thus a file matching a cop-tag implying indecent image might be nothing of the sort, but nobody would look at the file because that would be illegal. Thus there was the very real possibility you could end up in court charged with having an indecent image, yet nobody had actually verified that the image was actually indecent&#8230; Yet the prosecution would say it was based on a quite bad, very crude and unreliable computer algorithm (guess what with ML and AI we appear to have driven the wheel round a few times and not learned squat on each revolution&#8230;). Thus the question arises about &#8220;trusted cop-tags&#8221; that is &#8220;At what point can an authority issue a tag and have more than 50% of the population believe without question or checking that the tag is genuine, when it actually is not?&#8221;. The answer is worrying, with significant criminal penalties existing if an &#8220;indecent image is viewed&#8221; very few to no people would check the image if the cop-tags said it was &#8220;indecent&#8221;&#8230; Thus the ability to abuse the process to hide other information that might be &#8220;politically embarrassing&#8221; thus rightfully in the &#8220;public domain&#8221; is significant.</p>

<p><cite>We found that higher concentrations of anti-sera against SARS-CoV neutralized SARS-CoV infection, while highly diluted anti-sera significantly increased SARS-CoV infection and induced higher levels of apoptosis. Results from infectivity assays indicate that SARS-CoV ADE is primarily mediated by diluted antibodies against envelope spike proteins rather than nucleocapsid proteins.<i></i></p>
<p></cite><cite>We also generated monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins and observed that most of them promoted SARS-CoV infection. Combined, our results suggest that antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins may trigger ADE effects. The data raise new questions regarding a potential SARS-CoV vaccine, while shedding light on mechanisms involved in SARS pathogenesis.<i></i></p>

				<p>Gain-of-function research alters an organism or disease in a way that increases pathogenesis, transmissibility, or host range (the types of hosts that a microorganism can infect).</p>
<p>Such as altering a coronavirus found in bat host&#8230; to infect human hosts&#8230;.</p>

<p>In other words they used to say that enhancing PPPs (potential pandemic pathogens) to be able to transmit to humans&#8230; was a biosafety and biosecurity risk.</p>
<p>However, they updated the framework around this kind of research. A sort of &#8220;But what if we&#8217;re really careful and safe about it&#8221;. With these two changes.</p>

				<p>Wild U.S. deer found with coronavirus antibodies<br />
A new study detected coronavirus antibodies in 40 percent of deer tested this year.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>[Abstract]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Widespread human SARS-CoV-2 infections combined with human-wildlife interactions create the potential for reverse zoonosis from humans to wildlife. We targeted white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) for serosurveillance based on evidence these deer have ACE2 receptors with high affinity for SARS-CoV-2, are permissive to infection, exhibit sustained viral shedding, can transmit to conspecifics, and can be abundant near urban centers. We evaluated 624 pre- and post-pandemic serum samples from wild deer from four U.S. states for SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Antibodies were detected in 152 samples (40%) from 2021 using a surrogate virus neutralization test. A subset of samples was tested using a SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization test with high concordance between tests. These data suggest white-tailed deer in the populations assessed have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>  One-Sentence Summary Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 40% of wild white-tailed deer sampled from four U.S. states in 2021.</p>

<p>UK goverment unlawfully collected data. Not a surprise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mishcon.com/news/mishcon-acts-for-editor-of-disability-news-service-in-data-protection-matter" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.mishcon.com/news/mishcon-acts-for-editor-of-disability-news-service-in-data-protection-matter</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Mishcon de Reya has acted for John Pring, the editor of Disability News Service, in his attempts to make the Department for Work and Pension (DWP) comply with its legal duties under the UK GDPR and respond to his data subject access request. </p>
<p>Pring has been trying for two years to obtain details of emails and other information written about him by DWP’s communications department. Despite the Information Commissioner’s Office agreeing that DWP’s failure to provide the information was a clear breach of data protection laws, the department has repeatedly failed to release the information. </p>
<p>In response to this “extraordinary and reprehensible infringement of the law”, the Firm agreed to act for Pring on a pro bono basis in his battle to secure the information from DWP.</p>
<p>Commenting on the case, Senior Data Protection Specialist Jon Baines explained that:  </p>
<p>“Mr Pring should never have been put in this situation. Being able to access one’s data within a specified timescale is a fundamental human right, yet DWP has decided to evade its obligations in this regard, whilst the ICO has simply stood back and refused to take any meaningful action.</p>
<p>It cannot be right that a data subject – and especially one who performs such an important public interest role as Mr Pring – is forced to consult lawyers simply to get a government department to comply with the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p>UK government unlawfully withholds data requests. Again, not a surprise. It should be oted this is also in the context of UK government attaching gagging orders to charities in receipt of grants  and also the latest proposed law changes which seek to outlaw cooperation by charities during election periods. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of democracy, what charities do, and the fudamental rights of citizens. I don&#8217;t think I have to add the UK under the current government is dropping down everey international benchmark which matters.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/05/many-terrorists-abuse-women-research-extremist-attackers-violent-misogyny" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/05/many-terrorists-abuse-women-research-extremist-attackers-violent-misogyny</a></p>
<blockquote><p>What do many terrorists have in common? They abuse women<br />
Groundbreaking research shows that extremist attackers are often united in their violent misogyny, whatever their ideology</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>I thought these cases challenged conventional wisdom about terrorism, which holds that it is all about ideology. Many fatal terrorist attacks actually appeared to be an escalation of violence that had been going on, sometimes for years, against members of the perpetrator’s family. I was convinced that the police and MI5 needed to change the way they assessed the risk posed by suspects, treating a history of domestic violence as a very significant red flag.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>But this may not be straightforward when so few incidents lead to convictions. A recent report revealed that three-quarters of domestic abuse cases reported to the police in England were closed without the perpetrator being charged. Some organisations have come up with welcome innovations – Croydon in south London, for instance, has a specialist social worker sitting on Channel panels, leading to the disclosure of previously unsuspected domestic abuse in the history of V2R referrals.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know enough to provide a definitive opinion but sexist aggression may certainly be an indicator of intent or allegience. Violence comes in many forms and women have a significant role within society too and can and have played active roles in terrorism and the causes of terrorism.</p>

When a time-limited claim (such as ‘masks are obligatory on public transport’) emerges in search engine rankings, its apparent ‘authoritative’ solution can outstay its welcome even by many years, outranking later and more accurate content on the same topic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed hence my comments over the past few weeks that analysis of historical open source media and comparision with new data can reveal lies, criminal activity, and other abuses by the state and other bad actors including perjury.</p>

<blockquote><p>UNHCR wishes at the outset to acknowledge the UK’s contribution as a humanitarian donor and global champion for the refugee cause. Such a global role must be matched with a commensurate domestic asylum policy that abides by the letter and spirit of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (“1951 Convention”). The UK was among the core group of States that drafted the 1951 Convention and was among the first to sign and ratify it, taking a leadership role in giving effect to refugee protection.</p></blockquote>
<p>UK governent trying to have its cake an eat it. Sadly standards matter and the UK government has been caught with its hands in the cookie jar again. The report goes downhill from there.</p>

  Acute reduction of visual acuity and visual field after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 2nd dose: a case report:</p>
<p>  Abstract:</p>
<p>  Long-term and rare adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines are unknown. Hence, it is important to report them to improve the safety profile of the vaccines and enhance their use worldwide. Here, we describes a case of acute visual impairment after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine second dose.</p>

<p>People outside science seem to think peer review is a lot less fallible than it really is (IMHO). I&#8217;ve seen all kinds of garbage in &#8216;peer-reviewed and well respected&#8217; journals.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve even peer reviewed articles that in hindsight I wasn&#8217;t fit to.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a peer reviewed study suggesting COVID comes from space:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358766/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358766/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33081921/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33081921/</a></p>
<p>Both in an Elsevier peer reviewed journal.</p>
<p>And especially:</p>
<p><strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Like Coronavirus WIV1 Encodes an Extra Accessory Protein, ORFX, Involved in Modulation of the Host Immune Response</p>
<p>  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4936131/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4936131/</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>describes work at BSL2 where bat coronaviruses were grown in cell cultures expressing human ACE2.<br />
Is that an appropriate biosafety level for this work, or should it have been done at BSL3 or BSL4, or not done at all?</p>
<p>The fact that this paper is from 2016, and lists NIH in the funding, was done in BSL2, and has the following in the discussion section is enough for anyone to see they were genetically engineering coronaviruses, sometimes it led to nothing, and sometimes it led to gain of function.</p>
<p>“In this study, we have developed a fast and cost-effective method for reverse genetics of coronaviruses by combining two approaches developed by others (29, 30). Our method allows the genomes of coronaviruses to be split into multiple fragments and inserted into a BAC plasmid with a single step. Recombinant viruses can then be efficiently rescued by direct transfection of the BAC constructs. As the genomes can be divided into multiple short fragments, mutations can be introduced into individual fragments easily (31).”</p>
<blockquote><p>
  All experiments using live virus was conducted under biosafety level 2 (BSL2) conditions.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This research should never have been done, yet alone in a BSL2, and definitely not funded by the NIH to happen in a lab in China.</strong></p>

<p>On another note:</p>
<p>The entire premise of the EUA was to prevent infections in general.</p>
<p>“On November 20, 2020, the Sponsor (Pfizer, on behalf of Pfizer and BioNTech) submitted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) request to FDA for an investigational COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2) intended to prevent COVID-19”<br />

<p>Couple the CDC stating the vaccine is not fulfilling the EAU’s purpose with there are over 50X more deaths and serious adverse events reported in the first 8 months from this vaccine than for the comparable time period for any other vaccine in history, then&#8230;</p>
<p>Why is there not mass outcry for the EAU to be suspended until further efficacy and safety trials can be done?</p>

				<p>@ Clive Robinson, MarkH, SpaceLifeForm, Thoth, Wael, Winter, and all</p>
<p>re: <i>“Know what you are signing and not signing” issue.</i></p>
<p>I am not that familiar with this particular application protocol so read up a bit about it. I have seen other similar &#8220;lock, unlock&#8221;, &#8220;block, commit, rollback&#8221; systems.</p>
<p>They all presume that what&#8217;s in between the bookends is valid and correct. The block, commit, rollback model only provides a way to &#8220;undo&#8221; something but the correctness of the transaction is presumed inside the block.  The undo portion is a point-of-failure recovery, like for an unreachable destination.</p>
<p>By the time something hits the bookends the correctness is supposed to be validated. The time spent in lock-unlock is the minimal time frame for processing the transaction.  Some systems allow for the queuing of blocks waiting for final transaction.</p>
<p>Probably every programmer has found one or more instances where the bookends were set in the wrong place, and the “immutable data” was really “mutable data” and the lock did nothing at all.  Well it did block the transaction area for a nano-second like a NOP.</p>
