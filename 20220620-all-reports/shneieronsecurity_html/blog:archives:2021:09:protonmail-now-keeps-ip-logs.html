				<p>ProtonMail doesn&#8217;t need to block access via Tor. After all, the CIA already controls most of the Tor exit nodes . . . or was that the NSA?</p>

				<p>@ ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>After being compelled by a Swiss court to monitor IP logs for a particular user,</p></blockquote>
<p>Take note of the implicit time line,</p>
<p>1, No logs.<br />
2, Secret court order<br />
3, &#8212; unspecified time duration &#8212;<br />
4, Logging becomes &#8220;public knowledge&#8221;</p>
<p>That unspecified time of &#8220;secret logging&#8221; would for many be a danger zone. In that they would assume no logging and carry on their activities that might cause them problems down the line.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p><b>Assume you are ALWAYS, without exception logged, by everyone and act accordingly.</b></p>
<p>I know it is a sad state of affairs to realise that you are by default treated as a &#8220;suspect&#8221; or &#8220;enemy of the State&#8221; but that is the reality of this century so far and we are only 20% of the way through it.</p>
<p>As the old saying has it,</p>
<p><b>It will get worse before it gets better, if it ever does.</b></p>

				<p>FWIW, <a href="protonmail.com/blog/transparency-report" rel="nofollow ugc">ProtonMail&#8217;s warrant canary</a> has an interesting list of data orders they have received from various authorities, whether they complied, and why or why not.</p>
<p>It includes a 2019 case in which IP logging was enabled for a particular user. As Jim Salter&#8217;s Arstechnica article says, &#8220;The phrase &#8216;by default&#8217; did a lot of heavy lifting in ProtonMail&#8217;s old front page.&#8221;</p>

				<p>Potentially relevant to the above, I have seen work on using secure enclaves to create DNS servers that can not log their activity.  It is related to work on encrypted DNS and to work on adjusting the behavior so that traffic correlation is at least difficult (I hesitate to say anything is impossible in a security discussion).<br />
There is also discussion of whether that could be generalized to other cases.  I have trouble seeing how it could work for a mail relay that needs to store data anyway.  But it is an interesting path.</p>

				<p>This is blatantly untrue. Their privacy policy still states that they do not keep logs except in certain circumstances, and outlines those circumstances: <a href="https://protonmail.com/privacy-policy" rel="nofollow ugc">https://protonmail.com/privacy-policy</a></p>
<p>Bruce, I really respect you and I know you&#8217;re an expert, but this is second time I&#8217;ve caught you being sensationalist or flat out lying/misleading and it&#8217;s really making me question what else I&#8217;ve &#8220;learned&#8221; from you that isn&#8217;t true.</p>

				<p>Is there evidence that they (now?) log by default, rather than when legally compelled to for a specific user?  It ought to be pretty easy to have part of the authentication process say &#8216;is user in list of users we must log for?  ifyes, then log, otherwise don&#8217;t&#8217;.</p>

<p>Most TOR exit nodes have been and are controlled by the NSA for along time now.<br />
That is what I have known for a while.<br />
Now, as far as the CIA goes, I can&#8217;t elaborate on that.</p>

				<p>They maintain there VPN services don&#8217;t log, although who would believe that?</p>
<p>Ultimately, authorities everywhere hate the idea of citizens having genuine comms privacy, except of course for themselves. Solving it is more a political mindset problem, than a technical one. We need better politicians, preferably network tech savvy ones.</p>

<blockquote><p>Most TOR exit nodes have been and are controlled by the NSA for along time now.<br />

<p>Whether true or not, an HTTPS connection would make it non-trivial for them to track users, and an Onion Service would take exit nodes out of the picture entirely. A service that wants to promote itself as privacy-conscious should be doing something to ensure they don&#8217;t and can&#8217;t capture private data. An Onion Service is one way (e.g., seach &#8220;DuckDuckGo onion&#8221; on DuckDuckGo to get their onion address). An unaffiliated VPN, preferably in another country, could be another way (users could never really trust this, but it could protect the service from certain legal demands—remember, user data is toxic waste).</p>

ht tps://onion.live/site/protonmail</p>
<p>I also do not see how supplying the exit node does re-identify the user. You need to have both the entry&amp;exit nodes and quite a lot of traffic to re-identify a user.</p>
<p>As for alternatives to Tor, I have yet to hear of one that is of practical use for anyone not of the level of Bruce or Clive, and Clive does not seem to use electronic communication for secure messages.</p>

				<p>@Hedo @gregg Actually Protonmail supports tor, no exit nodes needed.</p>
<p>Which is great, because the biggest weakness of tor is having to trust exit nodes.</p>
<p>Seems like I&#8217;m in the minority here, but the summary seems to be.  It&#8217;s illegal for Protonmail to comply with any records request for anyone but the swiss government.</p>
<p>Like any Swiss company, Protonmail much comply with requests from the Swiss government &#8230; or cease to exist.</p>
<p>So the USA can&#8217;t just order Protonmail to collect or reveal logs.</p>

				<p>@ Gregg, Hedo, Corrine, Winter, and all.</p>
<p>The most efficient way would be for the NSA controlling the exit relays and for the CIA acting as backup on the monitoring process!  (it may be even worse.)</p>
<p>Tor uses three relays (guard, middle and exit).  Getting knowledge on the exit relay alone does not provide useful information to track the sender or, somewhat equivalent, identifying the guard (entry) relay, but it is a perfect place to monitor network traffic coming from the Tor network.</p>
<p>HTTPS alone does not provide a very good protection.  Think not only on the well known TLS inspection technique, widely used these days by the private sector, but also on the huge amount of information leaked by the URLs themselves.  It is not clear to me DoT or DoH are enough to hide our activity, as these techniques just hide requests to nameservers.</p>

<p>I am not as confident as you, it will never get better.  Internet has been snafu for decades; I cannot be as optimistic as to think there is a chance for it to get better.</p>
<p>Internet is a human development, so it has all the human being weaknesses and sins.  It was great until mid-90s (and I enjoyed it until then) but it is now more a problem than an answer.</p>

				<p>@Nate, Mind defining how long &#8220;Temporary&#8221; is? They claim that by default that they don&#8217;t permanently maintain IP logs. But they do temporary maintain IP logs for various purposes. But that word temporary is just a tad ambiguous for my taste.</p>

				<p>@Andy, from my understanding VPNs carry quite a high markup, the only way they could sell user data (according to their policies) would be breaking the law, if they sold (even on the darknet) it would be traced back to them (as database leaks are), is there another way to profit off of this data that I&#8217;m missing?</p>

				<p>@ Frankly, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>They can always make and enforce laws, even unreasonable ones, to defeat any technology. So we are only as secure as our politics, not our technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not fully true, that door swings both ways.</p>
<p>The ultimate laws that can not be cheated are the &#8220;natural laws&#8221; of the Universe. Even though our understanding of them is limited we know there are things we can not do.</p>
<p>So any laws passed by humans are constrained by the natural laws. It&#8217;s why we find the notion of making Pi a rational number by law so idiotic that in this day and age it&#8217;s funny.</p>
<p>More recently we had a laugh at the Australian Government for passing other just as idiotic laws. And prior to that a belly laugh at Australian PM &#8220;Malcom Turnbull&#8221; who made a right arsehat of himself by saying,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;The laws of Australia prevail in Australia, I can assure you of that. The laws of mathematics are very commendable but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>He was wrong and provably so. The only way &#8220;The Laws of Australia&#8221; can prevail against &#8220;The laws of mathematics&#8221; is by corruption in the  legislators, judiciary, and similar undemocratic behaviour. In fact the very behaviours we deplore in the domains of fascists, tyrants, despots, and Police States. Where &#8220;disposing of people&#8221; by &#8220;hit squads&#8221; and show trials by kangaroo courts is the way of ensuring continuance of power. However as the old saying has it,</p>
<p>&#8220;Live by the sword, die by the sword&#8221;</p>
<p>Is usually such &#8220;leaders&#8221; fate often by a subordinate who desires power, and, often stupidly the &#8220;status of office&#8221; as well&#8230; hence the old saws about &#8220;The power behind the throne&#8221; and &#8220;Sitting ducks&#8221;.</p>
<p>In such places it is clear that the laws of the nation no matter what they say are still bound by the laws of nature. After all legislation will not stop the inertia of an assassins bullet or knife.</p>
<p>However there is a counter balance to all tyrants, dictators and even democratic leaders, they all need resources to maintain their positions. Because there is a chain of &#8220;No resources, no followers, no power, no status&#8221;. If you can bring about &#8220;no resources&#8221; then things will collapse eventually. It is by the way the ultimate fate of mankind and no legislation will ever change that.</p>
<p>Because of the need for resources to maintain authority by guard labour etc there has to be some degree of freedom not just for the resource makers but the authoritarian following guard labour. In short there is a counter balance that provides an opportunity to evade the authority. It always favours the majority not the minority even when technology is used by the minority against the majority. In short ultimately it&#8217;s a numbers game.</p>
<p>Yes this appears to be contrary to the principles of &#8220;asymetric warfare&#8221; but actually it&#8217;s not. At the final analysis asymetric warfare only works where the majority defeat themselves through fear etc.</p>
<p>During WWI and WWII it was assumed that inflicting hardship, casualties and death on sufficient of the oppositions population would bring the politicians to heal. Well it did not, because for various reasons the population did not defeat themselves.</p>
<p>The thing about &#8220;numbers games&#8221; is you can use them advantageously to hide in. One face in a crowd is unremarkable. So is one message in a million as long as it remains unremarkable.</p>
<p>It is the idea behind covert communications within overt communications. The minority authority is resource bound by definition no matter how much technology they have to hand it to is always going to be constrained. Providing the communications is unremarkable the minority authority does not have direct cause to progress beyond a certain level of investigation, because it does not have the resources.</p>
<p>So the trick is to keep communications unremarkable, for which there are various techniques. One set of which are provably secure because of the issue of equiprobability. As an observer you can not say with certainty what an individual message means if it has redundancy within it.</p>
<p>You can hide a supprising amount in the redundancy of a spoken language or when it is written. The trick is to maintain equiprobability for an observer but not for the intended recipient.</p>
<p>Such systems were used during WWII and will work just as well today, providing people follow the rules correctly. You can even get &#8220;full message deniability&#8221; against &#8220;Second party betrayal&#8221; if you do things correctly.</p>
<p>The problem is most humans do not follow rules precisely, they look for short cuts or even ignore them. Just one mistake like that can make an unremarkable message remarkable, thus attract attention, the usage of more resources and the dangers of being targeted.</p>
<p>By and large the job of SigInt agencies is looking for &#8220;individual mistakes&#8221; and then working them looking for other more subtle mistakes or correlation with events (a form of traffic analysis).</p>
<p>That is they look for cracks to place the tip if a wedge and drive it. Sometimes they get lucky and it all falls appart, most often they do not as &#8220;random happens&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the end of the day all numbers games are a question of probability, if you can work within it, then your actions can not be distinquished by an observer from random events that crop up all over the place.</p>

				<p>The headline is quite misleading, they were required by a Swiss court to monitor and report the IP address of a single user.  That&#8217;s a long, long way from them logging IP addresses for all users.</p>
<p>Knowing Switzerland, it&#8217;s also quite possible that this triggers a law change which alters the way foreign governments can compel Swiss companies to play ball, for example by modifying the seriousness of the crime that needs to be committed.  So overall this could be a win for privacy.</p>

				<p>Protonmail has always logged IPs on signup &#8220;to fight spam&#8221;.</p>
<p>Also, their &#8220;onion address&#8221; only links to its login page. The second you click &#8220;SIGN UP&#8221; it redirects you to the clearnet address (<a href="https://protonmail.com/signup" rel="nofollow ugc">https://protonmail.com/signup</a>). And if you try to visit any other page with the onion url (i.e., by manually typing &#8220;/signup&#8221; after it) it redirects you back to the login page.</p>
<p>Anyway, not sure why everyone&#8217;s freaking out about all of this IP logging stuff now; it was always in the fine print. What surprises me is that they just handed it over and then said &#8220;well the court said we had to we didn&#8217;t have a choice 🙁 and we didn&#8217;t know it was a climate activist 🙁 they just told us to log and we did :(&#8220;.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is blatantly untrue. Their privacy policy still states that they do not keep logs except in certain circumstances, and outlines those circumstances: <a href="https://protonmail.com/privacy-policy" rel="nofollow ugc">https://protonmail.com/privacy-policy</a></p>
<p>Bruce, I really respect you and I know you’re an expert, but this is second time I’ve caught you being sensationalist or flat out lying/misleading and it’s really making me question what else I’ve “learned” from you that isn’t true.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s what I read when I had ploughed past the screaming headlines full of duck and roll types swallowing their tongues with knee jerk panic.</p>
<p>I no longer trust Bruce on anything to do with human rights issues and have declining respect down to zero on technical issues for some time. It&#8217;s nothing personal but there&#8217;s a whiff of male toxicity and MAGA surrounding the whole tech and security industry. The past month alone has seen a flood of company position statements doubling down on revenue maximisation and leaks about internal company attitudes not just on public policy issues but how they treat their workforce.</p>
<p>@Clive</p>

<p>This is the actual bit in the whole story which caught my eye. In the UK therehave been instances of state overreach with snooper laws being used to spy on what people were putting in their bins or whetehr they were eligible to send their children to a particular school. There has also been overreach by the police with invasive demands for the entire contents of victims phones. There have also been issues with heavy handed prosecution of what are politicial issues of public interest and environmental protests do fall into this area. A European Arrest Warrant can be a very powerful and useful tool but if you have prosecuters going too far then this mechanism can be abused which may have been true with this case. That said ProtonMail did seem true to their world albeit this now has the caveat that secrecy is modified by court orders. That is to be expected in any sane legal jurisdiction. I would expect someone either within the EU or Swizerland to take a look at this and ensure the warrants system is not being abused. This may have ECJ or ECHR implications. That is something which needs unpacking and the race to the finish media people as well as Bruce have paid no regard to this whatsoever. Nor has Clive&#8230;</p>
<p>Believe it or not over the past few years there actually have been legislative changes for the better and cases have been won. It&#8217;s not all gloom and doom even if people are carrying around depression like a sack of rocks on their back and media don&#8217;t give victories much coverage.</p>
<p>Politics can be about mood and I know people are tired especially after a massive right wing onslaught over the past few years plus a pandemic but politics and politics at the smaller more personal end of the spectrum is also about being alert and about tone &#8211; espiecally emotional tone. It&#8217;s also about morale. If everyone is going about bikeshedding and wailing every step this can play into a very negative narrative which is why I keep saying people need to back off from this and consider what rounded approach is best which requires a re-examination of points of view and attitudes.</p>

I've been writing about security issues on my <a href="/">blog</a> since 2004, and in my monthly <a href="/crypto-gram/">newsletter</a> since 1998. I'm a fellow and lecturer at Harvard's <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/bruce-schneier">Kennedy School</a>, a board member of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and the Chief of Security Architecture at <a href="https://inrupt.com/">Inrupt, Inc.</a> This personal website expresses the opinions of none of those organizations.</p>
