		<h2 class="entry">Facebook Is Down</h2>
		<p>Facebook &#8212; along with Instagram and WhatsApp &#8212; went <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/technology/facebook-down.html">down globally</a> today. Basically, someone <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/10/what-happened-to-facebook-instagram-whatsapp/">deleted</a> their BGP records, which made their DNS <a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1445065065527394321">fall apart</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;at approximately 11:39 a.m. ET today (15:39 UTC), someone at Facebook caused an update to be made to the company&#8217;s Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) records. BGP is a mechanism by which Internet service providers of the world share information about which providers are responsible for routing Internet traffic to which specific groups of Internet addresses.</p>
<p>In simpler terms, sometime this morning Facebook took away the map telling the world&#8217;s computers how to find its various online properties. As a result, when one types Facebook.com into a web browser, the browser has no idea where to find Facebook.com, and so returns an error page.</p>
<p>In addition to stranding billions of users, the Facebook outage also has stranded its employees from communicating with one another using their internal Facebook tools. That&#8217;s because Facebook&#8217;s email and tools are all managed in house and via the same domains that are now stranded. </p></blockquote>
<p>What I heard is that none of the employee <a href="https://twitter.com/sheeraf/status/1445099150316503057?s=21">keycards work</a>, since they have to ping a now-unreachable server. So people can&#8217;t get into buildings and offices.</p>
<p>And every third-party site that relies on &#8220;log in with Facebook&#8221; is stuck as well.</p>
<p>The fix <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-took-facebook-down-major-global-outage-drags-on/">won&#8217;t be quick</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a former network admin who worked on the internet at this level, I anticipate Facebook will be down for hours more. I suspect it will end up being Facebook&#8217;s longest and most severe failure to date before it&#8217;s fixed.</p></blockquote>
<p>We all know the security risks of <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/12/software_monocu.html">monocultures</a>.</p>

				<p>If one were of a conspiratorial mind, one might be of a mind to suggest that this was an intentional &#8220;shot across the bow&#8221; by Facebook to remind the world just how &#8220;important&#8221; it is and the woe that would befall those who dare to tinker with it.</p>

				<p>I had a college professor who told us, if we were going to fail, and make mistakes, it&#8217;s better to do it now, then later in life.</p>
<p>Facebook would have been better off to have had this problem in their youth. To have it happen now just makes them look stupid, and stupid in a way that you don&#8217;t want to meet them at a bar anymore, or let your daughter date them.</p>
<p>The gene pool is all we have, and Facebook is another example of why cousins shouldn&#8217;t marry.</p>

				<p>Maybe that someone who made the update watched the 60 minutes story last evening on the Facebook “whistle blower “ and decided they had enough of the corporate coverups as well.</p>

				<p>@Bruce Schneier:</p>
<p>&#8220;And every third-party site that relies on “log in with Facebook” is stuck as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is also in effect a DDOS of the DNS system.</p>
<p>@ALL:</p>
<p>Host names are not real, they are translated to IP addresses, and it is the IP addresses that are used to route traffic. The translation is done by a glob spanning database called the &#8220;Domain Name System&#8221;(DND) which is a hierarchical series of servers.</p>
<p>To keep the load down on the DNS servers and reduce traffic on the netwoek each host keeps a local cache of host names to IP addresses and it is this cache where most translations actually take place. The length of time a translation stays in the cache is dependent on several factors, but usually it&#8217;s 20mins as a minimum.</p>
<p>So now imagine what happens when a host name can not be resolved. Importantly it&#8217;s not in the hosts local cache so it has to send out a DNS request across the network.</p>
<p>If your host can not resolve the host name to IP address, every time you click on a link to that host name out goes a DNS request.</p>
<p>Whilst that is bad enough, consider all those web pages you can get to, that also have those &#8220;facebook buttons&#8221; your browser just loading such a button can trigger a DNS request&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s way more DNS traffic than would be normal.</p>
<p>So the likes of Google and Clodflare get effected because they host the commonly used DNS servers&#8230;</p>

				<p>For what it&#8217;s worth as someone who has installed and programmed a lot of access control systems (AKA Badge readers) the panels are supposed to revert to internal memory to allow or deny access during network or server outages, cache the transactions and upload them when the connection is restored.  That&#8217;s been the standard for literally 30 years.  If their (FB) access control system is so poorly installed or managed that the paneles can&#8217;t make local decisions during outages, they need to fire their contractor and install a better system.</p>

				<p>This bit, from @cullend, made me as a DNS admin laugh hard:</p>
<p>&#8220;facebook.com is registered with<br />
  &#8220;registrarsafe.com&#8221; as registrar.  &#8220;registrarsafe.com&#8221;<br />
  is unreachable because it&#8217;s using Facebook&#8217;s DNS<br />
  servers and is probably a unit of Facebook.<br />
  &#8220;registrarsafe.com&#8221; is registered wtih<br />
  &#8220;registrarsafe.com&#8221;.</p>
<p>(I think their headquarters street address &#8212; the former Sun Microsystems<br />
campus &#8212; needs to be changed from One Facebook Way to One Single Point of<br />
Failure Way.)</p>

				<p>@SLF, All<br />
I&#8217;m probably missing something, but isn&#8217;t this yet another reason for client side caching of DNS? I used to use pdnsd on another OS, set your own ttl, cache stored on disk, but it hasn&#8217;t had any TLC for too long so I&#8217;m reluctant to compile it for this OS.</p>

				<p>Bgp sends out update packets every 30mins, if a path metric changes like slower link(cat6, fiber,dial up) or longer hops it changes the table to a new route ,it pass the info approximately 5 routers each 30 mins. They seem by nmap scan to run redhat UDP 500 .<br />
Last time I checked Cisco, juniper routers were around $20-40k.</p>
<p>Even Facebook can do something right now and again 😉</p>

				<p>Quite a shame that it was only down for a few hours.  If it was down for a week, people might learn to actually be social again. Maybe they might even talk to one another&#8230;with their voices&#8230;or even better, face-to-face!</p>
<p>Who the hell uses the same servers for internal apps (ie: security, access control, HVAC, etc.) as external/public-facing?  Especially at THIS level?  I&#8217;m working for a small business and we keep all of our public-facing stuff in a completely separate facility.</p>
<p>&#8230;and who the hell uses Login with Facebook?   Don&#8217;t they have enough access to your personal details?  Login with Facebook has been a huge blessing to law enforcement and other snoopy types.</p>
<p>@Count0: I&#8217;m not surprised.  Tech/upstart type companies and millennials think everything traditional = bad!! and they&#8217;ll roll their own with Java in the cloud.  Of course, everything must have an iPhone app, especially when a regular webpage will do just fine.</p>

				<p>This incident is proof that many people can be stranded and shut off from work, family and friends. It is clear that Facebook needs more oversight to ensure that their users won&#8217;t have to suffer such a widespread outage due to error or in-house sabotage. That WhatsApp and Instagram also went down adds insult to injury, from within.</p>

<p>The Great Hack Back</p>
<p>Overriding DNS TTL via your local DNS caching DNS resolver (ex: pdnsd, been there, done that), or an actual DNS recursive DNS caching resolver (ex: Unbound, been there, done that) would not help in this situation at all.</p>
<p>The core problem was the withdrawal of the BGP routing information.</p>
<p>Even if you cached the ip address of the server, your upstream routers were blind as to how to route the packets.  The routers no longer knew where to send the packets.</p>
<p>This was ultimately a BGP problem, not a DNS problem.</p>
<p>Facebook has now royally screwed up.  They were so concerned to get back online, they failed to do proper IR.</p>
<p>They are pwned.  It&#8217;s a good thing (TM).</p>

				<p>@SpaceLifeForm:</p>
<p>&#8220;The core problem was the withdrawal of the BGP routing information.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they wiped themselves off of the map quite literally by failing to say &#8216;Hi to the world&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook has now royally screwed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>That I think counts as the understatment of the week, and it&#8217;s only Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were so concerned to get back online, they failed to do proper IR.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ahh&#8230; Yes, potentially &#8216;after shocks&#8217; to come, but also it might well hide the &#8216;Real Why&#8217; of what happened. After all was it an insider or outsider? intentional or accidental?</p>
<p>Whilst it all has a funny side, I suspect being a fly on the wall at Facecrooks internal incident review would be entertaining.</p>
<p>Perhaps an OsInt of LinkedIn might reveal who&#8217;s finger on which button caused the oopsie-downsie that knocked the parrot off of the perch.</p>
<p>Unless of course, if it was actually an outsider doing it intentionally&#8230; In which case that is one heck of a lot of bragging rights, if you can stay ahead of the snatch squads and rendition teams.</p>

<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because there was no one inside.  Covid-19.</p>
<p>And because they were stupid.</p>
<p>They put all of their eggs in the same basket.</p>
<p>They ran their own DNS <em>COMPLETELY</em> on their own network.</p>
<p>They created their own DNS and BGP Co-dependency.</p>
<p>They could not fix the BGP problem remotely, because DNS was dead.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ever use a floppy and a null modem cable to recover your router?</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in the 90&#8217;s you did not have much choice especially with 486 based *nix systems and Spark based systems. I can remember sitting there with a box of 80-130 floppy disks building / rebuilding systems from bare bones hardware it was one way to loose a day of your life, each floppy in a set taking 90secs to be read in then fingers crossed you typed the incantations correctly. Especially for &#8216;hardening&#8217; one slip there and around you went again&#8230;</p>
<p>Then unless you had a &#8216;real network connection&#8217; having to connect via modem to download the latest security patches&#8230; So you needed tools and a telephone patch set as well&#8230;</p>
<p>Even in the mid 2000&#8217;s Sun boxes often had to be brought back up with a crossover cable and terminal. But rather than a floppy by then you had to plug in a CD-ROM drive, unless you wanted to carry your own &#8220;network device&#8221; around with you&#8230; I remember building such a network device out of a high end IBM laptop that also did duty as a terminal&#8230; So both a serial crossover and Cat5 crossover cable.</p>
<p>There are still times when this is the only way, and a good Sysadmin will have a &#8216;ring binder&#8217; or &#8216;spring file box&#8217; with all the documentation and cables and disks in it sitting on the shelf. Even a little 4port network hub oh and these days a USB hub and all those USB dongles and adaptor cables and even shock horror a WiFi AP/router. Oh and instead of a modem, a 4G LTE phone or Mobile Broadband dongle&#8230;</p>
<p>So yeah, sometimes still &#8216;same 5h1t different technology&#8217;.</p>

				<ol>
<li>I wonder who gets to change the industry he&#8217;s working for&#8230;</li>
<li>Funny thing, I&#8217;ve just had a serious conversation with our soon-to-be-adults about FB, Insta etc. and THIS happens! Panic ensues amongst the younger members of the family (I was out at work and hadn&#8217;t a chance to notice), but fortunately the event was mentioned in the news on FM radio. Ufff&#8230; the world is fine, it is but a glitch. Dad was right, right?</li>
<li>To err is human, to screw up royally is&#8230; whatever. Aaaah, the old days as the univ&#8217;s BoFH&#8230; I wanted to have &#8216;order&#8217; in /etc/passwd by sorting it by UID.</li>
</ol>
<p>sort -n -t: -k3,3 passwd</p>
<p>Can you see what&#8217;s the problem here? DON&#8217;T DO IT AT HOME! And I did not have a backup of the passwd file&#8230; &gt;10k entries gone&#8230;</p>
<p>THINK! QUICK!!! ok, shutdown NOW and boot to single user mode before anything gets to overwrite disk blocks that once were the passwd file. It was on old Ultrix with funny fixed partition schemes. I dded the root partition to a file on usr (fortunately I had enough space), then grepped for passwd-format lines with a largish regexp. Took 20 mins. Then I sorted the file (properly this time!), then removed duplicates and rubbish by hand. Half an hour later I was back up and running. It was a smallish system even by then-contemporary standards.</p>

				<p>I believe this will explain everything&#8230; from FB Engineering in May &#8217;21</p>
<p>&#8220;To achieve the goals we’d set, we had to go beyond using BGP as a mere routing protocol. The resulting design creates a baseline connectivity configuration on top of our existing scalable network topology. We employ a uniform AS numbering scheme that is reused across different data center fabrics, simplifying ASN management across data centers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To support the growing scale and evolving routing requirements, our switch-level BGP agent needs periodic updates to add new features, optimization, and bug fixes. To optimize this process (i.e., to ensure fast, frequent changes to the network infrastructure to support good route processing performance), we implemented an in-house BGP agent.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>There are no impeccable records anymore.</p></blockquote>
<p>There never were, nor can there ever be realy.</p>
<p>@ ALL</p>
<p>What did Facebook do wrong?</p>
<p>Well the list is long and some of it is caused by trying to do the impossible (be 100% secure).</p>
<p>As a result they lost their way in complexity their security archtects did not understand sufficiently.</p>
<p>There is an old joke about,</p>
<p>&#8216;The way to remove a single point of failure, is to form a committee and have each bring their own point of failure with them&#8217;.</p>
<p>An imperfect solution to getting towards 100% availability / reliability / security / etc is to avoid &#8220;chains&#8221; and use &#8220;nets&#8221;. Chains fail at the weakest link no matter how strong the other links. Nets on the other hand generaly only partially fail and in little ways.</p>
<p>When it comes to communications those who need high availability / reliability / security / etc have a basic way to cover it, and it is called PACE for,</p>
<p>P, Primary<br />
A, Alternate<br />
C, Contingency<br />
E, Emergancy</p>
<p>The problem though is that PACE can go horribly wrong due to the likes of hidden dependencies, or worse an &#8220;out of plan&#8221; fall back during training / testing like mobile phones, that create a &#8220;dependency&#8221; in peoples minds[1].</p>
<p>That is if every time something goes wrong with the plan during training / testing you pick up the mobile phone, what are you going to do when the mobile phone network goes down as well?</p>
<p>Remote or distance working, is incredibly fragil, it&#8217;s something that people have been ignoring during COVID lockdowns. It is entirely dependent on two things,</p>
<p>1, Communications which fail<br />
2, Planning in detail</p>
<p>The first is going to happen in an emergancy for a whole host of unavoidable reasons.</p>
<p>Which is why the second is realy the only thing that will get your objectives met.</p>
<p>Things change all the time, many are beyond your control, but not your mitigation, providing you are aware of them. It&#8217;s why the likes of the military run very realistic war games from pushing small pieces of paper around a table top through to full blow boots on the ground deployments.</p>
<p>If you do not</p>
<p>1, Observe,<br />
2, Analyze,<br />
3, Plan,<br />
4, Train,<br />
5, Test,<br />
6, Reformulate,</p>
<p>As a repeated cycle you are actually &#8216;Planing to fail&#8217;.</p>

				<p>To those joking about &#8220;nothing of value was lost&#8221;: Keep in mind that aside from Facebook proper, Whatsapp being down is a <em>serious</em> infrastructure failure to many countries across the world. Many businesses use that as their primary means of communication, and in some places even emergency services rely on it.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m local to the Bay Area, and from a social circle that includes a few Facebook employees I&#8217;ve heard that with keycards not working and unable to get through to administer their machines remotely, they were forced to use an angle grinder to cut open a door and gain access to the machines that needed to be reconfigured.</p>
<p>This is an example of a type of mistake that happens fairly often in safety and security planning; it relies on systems that will be impaired in the event that these contingencies are needed.  The same thing has happened in other ways elsewhere.</p>
<p>Fukushima for example had the emergency pumps that were supposed to protect it from flooding, located below sea level&#8230;. like the pumps in New York when Sandy hit and the pumps in New Orleans when Katrina hit.  Emergency evacuation plans in New Orleans and Galveston relied on buses that were kept in a low-lying lot that was among the first places flooded.  Emergency communications in a lot of places relies on power that is likely to be out in an emergency.  Or on internet connectivity that won&#8217;t be connected when the microwave towers lose their power or their wired connections.  In more places than I want to count hospitals have failed because their emergency generators were either in the basements where they got flooded by the same storm that cuts off power, or exposed on the roof where wear and exposure accumulated until they couldn&#8217;t start.</p>
<p>In cases like Facebook, it&#8217;s comical; they have to go get an angle grinder and everybody has a laugh. It&#8217;s not like Facebook is doing anything important.  But in a lot of places this failure to understand what &#8217;emergency planning&#8217; means about the infrastructure that the plan has available to rely on gets deadly serious.</p>

<blockquote><p>Fukushima for example had the emergency pumps that were supposed to protect it from flooding, located below sea level…. like the pumps in New York when Sandy hit and the pumps in New Orleans when Katrina hit. </p></blockquote>
<p>Pumps are almost always a bad example to pick.</p>
<p>Because although they can pump water up quite high, they can not suck water up more than a few meters (vaccum hight of water is just over 30ft depending on where you are). So if the normal tide hight range is say six meters then the pump is going to get wet from time to time.</p>
<p>That is you can not put a pump very far above your bottom sump level.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why many pumps are designed to be submersible, or are cased into water tight compartments.</p>
