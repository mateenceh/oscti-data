		<h2 class="entry">More Russian SVR Supply-Chain Attacks</h2>
		<p>Microsoft is <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/10/24/new-activity-from-russian-actor-nobelium/">reporting</a> that the same attacker that was behind the SolarWinds breach &#8212; the Russian SVR, which Microsoft is calling Nobelium &#8212; is continuing with similar supply-chain attacks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nobelium has been attempting to replicate the approach it has used in past attacks by targeting organizations integral to the global IT supply chain. This time, it is attacking a different part of the supply chain: resellers and other technology service providers that customize, deploy and manage cloud services and other technologies on behalf of their customers. We believe Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers&#8217; IT systems and more easily impersonate an organization&#8217;s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers. We began observing this latest campaign in May 2021 and have been notifying impacted partners and customers while also developing new technical assistance and guidance for the reseller community. Since May, we have notified more than 140 resellers and technology service providers that have been targeted by Nobelium. We continue to investigate, but to date we believe as many as 14 of these resellers and service providers have been compromised. Fortunately, we have discovered this campaign during its early stages, and we are sharing these developments to help cloud service resellers, technology providers, and their customers take timely steps to help ensure Nobelium is not more successful.</p></blockquote>

				<p>Interesting but the main SVR attack will be against the supply chain for AWS because of its government client base.</p>

				<p>@ ALL,</p>
<p>From the article,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;used in past attacks by targeting organizations integral to the global IT <b>supply chain</b>. This time, it is attacking a different part of the <b>supply chain</b>&#8220;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the &#8220;IT&#8221; supply chain,  where this is going to happen it&#8217;s all supply chains.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of opinion, but &#8220;the down hill sloop&#8221; of atleast twenty years of managment stupidity based on &#8220;The Chicago School&#8221; of economics promalgated by neo-cons and others. It is best expressed by the mantra taught to economic and MBA students, that &#8220;to be competitive, you have to optomise&#8230;&#8221; which gets wrapped into &#8220;Never leave money on the table/floor&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nature has over more millennia than can be counted, developed a survival stratagy for living entities. Some call it the 2/3rds or 66% of capacity stratagy. What it means is that if you optomize beyond that point your entity is over the resiliance peak and on the fast downhill slope to otherwise avoidable disaster. Worse once over that peak a few more % and you reach a &#8220;tipping point&#8221; where the entity can not pull back by it&#8217;s self.</p>
<p>Thus the entity becaomes under the control of capricious others and a hostile environment.</p>
<p>This is good for those neo-cons who then use it as leverage in hostile take overs and the inevitable destruction which ends up with the loss to society of inovation, choice, jobs and much much more besides. Such thinking &#8220;hollows out society&#8221; and in turn it becomes brittle and subject to the capricious whims of neo-cons and worse.</p>
<p>I and others have been pointing out the dangers for years, one of which is society as we know it will cease to be, and the result will be a new feudal system in which you will have a closed aristocracy that own, and the ordinary citizen will be reduced via rent seeking behaviours into a serfdom worse than slavery.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry if others don&#8217;t want to think it through, but not taking responsability is a major failing in modern times.</p>
<p>Criminals steal where they can, if you do not take responsability to take reasonable deterents you will at some point get robbed it&#8217;s just a matter of probability in a &#8220;target rich environment&#8221;. At that point you will discover that nobody is there to help you, not the police, not the government or any others you pay taxes towards.</p>
<p>Ask yourself what the two most precious things are that you own?</p>
<p>You will find on the top of the list,</p>
<p>1, Your life,<br />
2, Your freedom,</p>
<p>For several centuries people who make up society have fought for those, are you going to let others steal them away from you?</p>
<p>Well it&#8217;s your responsability to take reasonable steps so they do not.</p>
<p>Long supply chains that have been paired to the bone, are brittle beyond most peoples understanding. The sheer numbers of brittle supply chains in all parts of the economy thus society in general is stagering. We look back on the &#8220;Toilet roll crisis&#8221; and many delude themselves and find it ammusing or blaim horders or prepers or to be blunt, those who think faster and act rather than wallow in complacency which most of society actually does these days. Well toilet rolls, fuel and other &#8220;que for it&#8221; items are just the equivalent of those tiny tiny bubbles that appear at the side of a cooking pot at the heat is turned up and things come to a boil, if not boil over causing significant harm.</p>
<p>Look at what the wealthy and neo-cons have been doing, they have seen the consequence of what brittle supply chains mean. They have taken some of that and put it towards surviving what they can see will come from their actions. Thus you have the Corporate Billionaires building survival shelters stocked with atleast five years of food and potable water, fuel and similar, ask yourself why they feel the need to take the responsability of taking for themselves and their loved ones what they view as &#8220;reasonable action&#8221; to mitigate an uncertain future that they see as being close enough to warrent attention now.</p>
<p>Remember this behaviour is far from new history shows it happening over and over. Which is why some religions require their followers to put by not just a year of supplies for their family, but their neighbours as well.</p>
<p>You go back a couple of thousand years or more, where sensible heads of state put by four years of grain and similar, knowing that fat times are followed by lean and starving people are not just desperate but easily become the worst that humanity can be.</p>

				<p>Given the prevalence of FOSS in infrastructure (both AWS and Azure are heavy users of GNU/Linux, for example), I&#8217;m surprised that there haven&#8217;t been more reports of successful infiltration/modification of such software.  We know, for example, that OpenBSD was warned of a backdoor inserted into their code (which they deny), and Linus Torvalds famously answered the question of whether he&#8217;d been approached to backdoor the Linux kernel by answering &#8220;No&#8221; while nodding his head.</p>

				<p>@ Jeff,</p>
<blockquote><p>We know, for example, that OpenBSD was warned of a backdoor inserted into their code (which they deny)</p></blockquote>
<p>Err no, it&#8217;s more interesting than that.</p>
<p>Briefly,</p>
<p>1) A person in private communications to one of the core BSD developers aluded to the fact that a backdoor had been put in the network code by another person.</p>
<p>2) The core developer almost immediately made it public.</p>
<p>3) Lots of experienced eyes looked but nothing at the code or implemented protocol level was found that could be claimed was a backdoor.</p>
<p>Some time after that it became abundantly clear the NSA did put backdoors in &#8220;code&#8221;, &#8220;protocols&#8221;, &#8220;Standards&#8221; and by &#8220;managment(RSA)&#8221; and &#8220;interception(CISCO kit)&#8221; and possibly by suborning(Jupiter Networks). So any which way they can, which was absolutly no surprise to me as I&#8217;d long predicted they targeted,</p>
<p>1, Implementations,<br />
2, Protocols,<br />
3, Standards,</p>
<p>And I had presented reasoning they had actually &#8220;backdoored&#8221; the NIST AES contest.</p>
<p>Eventually Niels Ferguson &#8211;who our host @Brucehas worked with&#8211;, whilst working at Microsoft, got deeply suspicious about certain things. He started to go public with his suspicions and later showed the likely hood that the NSA had backdoored the NIST standard via a Digital RNG was probable. This backdoored DRBG was &#8220;mandated for US Government US&#8221; in generating amoungst other things &#8220;Roots of Trust&#8221;(RoT). Further somehow still not publically known backdoored the DRBG appeared in Jupiter Networks equipment that generated network encryption keys&#8230;</p>
<p>Whilst nobody has been able to point a finger at the BSD code, nor can anyone currently say it is not backdoored by some trick not yet identified&#8230; Which is a bit of a quandary, should you trust when you can not verify?, me I just mitigate where I can.</p>
<p>However when it comes to pointing fingers at backdooring codes, protocols in products, etc there are lots and lots of fingers pointing Microsoft&#8217;s way especially recently&#8230; Some would say that MSFT don&#8217;t want to be the &#8220;how not to&#8221; poster child, especially with Win 11 flapping badly in the wings.</p>
<p>So who gets to decide who is right and who is wrong in a finger pointing game?</p>
<p>Well some say the majority vote (and MSFT has that by the bucket full). Me I&#8217;m of the &#8220;Court Standard Evidence&#8221; for blaim, &#8220;meer whispers of impropriety&#8221; for mitigation[1] view.</p>
<p>So yes I have two standards and they are more than a few &#8220;country miles&#8221; appart. Because as I know from experience,</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Atribution is hard very hard, but false flag Ops and rumours are easy&#8221;</b>.</p>
<p>[1] My over caution on what might be rumours, comes about from personally backdooring crypto code. It&#8217;s quite some years ago as I&#8217;ve previously mentioned and actually was way to easy to do. No the backdoor did not go out in shipped product, but it did get right through the &#8220;code review and test phases&#8221; and was at the point it was packaged to be &#8220;code signed&#8221;. My reason for doing so was to demonstrate the fundemental failing of the QA process and in specific the &#8220;code review&#8221; process. The organisation concerned had a managment ethos that the best programers produced product, those that did the code reviews were frequently not even past programers&#8230; Unfortunatly this &#8220;the best create the worst review&#8221; ethos is all to common in the consumer and much commercial software production organisations. Clearly it fails, and fails badly, however on ISO9000 and similar paperwork it looks good&#8230;</p>
<p>The moral,</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Trust ye not, what ye nor others can expressly verify, so cast not stones but mitigate accordingly&#8221;</b>.</p>

				<p>Excellent. If you American butchers don&#8217;t want to get your just desserts, don&#8217;t murder millions around the world.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m more concerned about US far right billionaire sourced dark money hiding behind front organisations and money laundering flooding Europe but that&#8217;s just me. It&#8217;s all been traced back to the source and names named not that you would read about it in the mainstream media. Attribution is difficult? Not when they brag about it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been an interesting choice of ransomware victims lately. Sinclair Media? Maybe ransomware hackers with a social conscience?</p>
<p>Yes protocols and networks are backdoored but the ones which get my attention are the ones related to human rights and governance not technology. As for the police and government not being there to help you to a large degree in the UK at least they are the problem. As for standards reviews of &#8220;bad actors&#8221; I can say with absolute certainty they are not up to scratch. As for whistleblowing one of of the reasons why I am planning for taking &#8220;exceptional measures&#8221; is the whistleblowing angle. I have been directly to my face threatened over this and criminal and other measures do apply and the police looked the other way. It didn&#8217;t even get as far as being &#8220;no crimed&#8221;. It never made the official record.</p>
<p>I differ from Clive in his application of blame on court standards versus mitigate on the rumour. The reason is it depends on history and context, and what indicators exist and who is the source. Sometimes it depends. Sometimes the threat is coming from elsewhere. Technology is fairly cut and dried. People are a bit more messy.</p>
<p>As for OpenBSD if there is a backdoor in there I suggest stop treating it as technology as this encourages linear thinking. Treat it more like an exercise in sociology or people. You have to be alert to being lied to, misinformed, shuffled about, invisible doors going clang to create rachet effects, broken contracts and people going behind your back, and data being deleted. It&#8217;s very rarely any single thing and not always something which appears bad until later. To the unknowing eye it may appear benign but to the expert eye who sees beyond the surface a vortex of horror.</p>

				<p>Weirdly two of the groups associated with SVR’s APT29 group are named after elements: NOBELIUM and YTTRIUM.</p>
<p>The element Nobelium was first produced in 1956, at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna, then in the USSR. However it was named after the place where it was thought that it had been discovered &#8211; Sweden and their Alfred Nobel. Nobelium is a radioactive metal whose half life is only 58 minutes.</p>
<p>The element Yttrium was actually first isolated in Sweden and is named for the Swedish village of Ytterby.</p>
<p>I am no expert in deciphering the names of threat actor groups, nonetheless they are curious choices.</p>
<p>MITRE’s list of associated APT29 groups:<br />
hxxps://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016/</p>
<p>If I’m wrong about any of this, feel free to correct me.</p>

				<p>All these recent public claims that one or any other particular nation caused any particular hack or malware attack is not likely;</p>
<p>There has been no full substantiation of claims; no evidence; no proof;</p>
<p>This is all just &#8220;heresay&#8221;, gossip.</p>
<p>If the accused nations were individual people within the USA, they would be able to sue in response, with a likelihood of winning;</p>
<p>To continue the metaphor, the accusations might fall under the legal categories of libel and slander and defamation.</p>
<p>Without any hard proof of wrongdoing, it&#8217;s just gossip or propaganda, maybe both.</p>
<p>Is it really a good idea to follow the news straight into WWW III types of zeitgeist ?</p>
<p>thanks(?)</p>
