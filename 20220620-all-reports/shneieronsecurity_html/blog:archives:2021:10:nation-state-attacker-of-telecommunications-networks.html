		<p>Someone has been <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/an-analysis-of-lightbasin-telecommunications-attacks/">hacking telecommunications networks</a> around the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>LightBasin (aka UNC1945) is an activity cluster that has been consistently targeting the telecommunications sector at a global scale since at least 2016, leveraging custom tools and an in-depth knowledge of telecommunications network architectures.
<li>Recent findings highlight this cluster&#8217;s extensive knowledge of telecommunications protocols, including the emulation of these protocols to facilitate command and control (C2) and utilizing scanning/packet-capture tools to retrieve highly specific information from mobile communication infrastructure, such as subscriber information and call metadata.
<li>The nature of the data targeted by the actor aligns with information likely to be of significant interest to signals intelligence organizations.
<li>CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that LightBasin is a targeted intrusion actor that will continue to target the telecommunications sector. This assessment is made with high confidence and is based on tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), target scope, and objectives exhibited by this activity cluster. There is currently not enough available evidence to link the cluster&#8217;s activity to a specific country-nexus.</ul>
<p>Some <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/analysis/black-hat/trio-of-hacking-clusters-targeting-telcos-traced-back-to-chinese-state-espionage">relation to China</a> is reported, but this is not a definitive attribution.</p>

				<p>Attribution is hard. (I know, I know, I&#8217;ll be that parrot/broken record today).</p>
<p>Internet protocols/standards/layers need a serious remodeling from ground up.<br />
It was built on a very insecure foundation and it&#8217;s time it got rebuilt with<br />
NON-REPUDIATION built in everywhere. Every step of the way, non-repudiation<br />
must be enforced, non-negotiable, not optional, mandatory.<br />
This would take care of Authenticity, Accountability, Integrity, and<br />
many other important things because the amount of negative consequences<br />
(impact on human lives/safety), grows by the day, and we need to start<br />
making these cyber crimes (ransomware, etc) an INTEGRAL part of our foreign policy.<br />
I&#8217;m referring to the USA, but this can easily be applied to any other country/government.<br />
In other words, there must be political/diplomatic, state level policies in place,<br />
on the books, that provide for appropriate sanctions for those engaging and/or aiding<br />
such activities. I may not live to see it, but some of these nasty hacks taking place<br />
today, may actually lead to, or be perceived as acts of war in the near future.<br />
But &#8220;Let&#8217;s go back to the rock and see it @440&#8221;<br />
Attribution is hard.<br />

Trying to act my age today.</p>

				<p>All data goes over TCP/IP (including Voice). It should be possible to create a system that does all communication using e2e encryption (like Signal) with end-point obfuscation (a la Tor). Say, by hooking up a computer-like device to a mobile phone as a hotspot. That way I should be able to combine mobile phone level flexibility with the &#8220;best available security&#8221;.</p>
<p>That this is not already done tells me I have not seen all the obstacles.</p>
<p>My question is, what are the obstacles?</p>

<p>Probably because there is no incentive for the ISPs/telecoms to work on it. It would not lead to any improvements for the average user (who doesn&#8217;t care about security at all), while having a small cost attached to it.</p>

&#8220;Probably because there is no incentive for the ISPs/telecoms to work on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, the police and TLAs of the home countries would work actively against any such adaptation.</p>
<p>But as a user, I can already use tor/vpns on my mobile phone, or simply hook up my laptop/tablet to my phone in &#8220;hotspot mode&#8221;, and do everything over the mobile network. I can do voice and video calls over Whatsap or Signal, using a second mobile as a hotspot. This all keeps the telco&#8217;s out of the loop. And if Signal is not private enough, you can set up your own Signal network (the code is FLOSS).</p>
<p>Still, people pay premium prices for crappy cryptophones that connect directly to the telco networks.</p>
<p>What obstacles do I miss here?</p>

				<p>@Peter, @Winter</p>
<p>TOR might work pretty well for text messages.</p>
<p>Latency and especially tail latency would be a huge problem for voice calls.</p>
<p>TOR would collapse if everyone used it for all their mobile web browsing.  You could throw resources at the problem but TOR multiplies network bandwidth by design and consumes non-trivial compute.</p>

&#8220;TOR would collapse if everyone used it for all their mobile web browsing. &#8221;</p>
<p>That is obviously true as TOR is run by volunteers. The only alternative is paid VPN&#8217;s, which seem to be not particularly good. Dedicated users could set up their own TOR&amp;Onion/VPN servers and tunnel into them. All suboptimal to functioning shared services.</p>
<p>But almost everything you can think off seems to me better, privacy and security wise, than using the mobile network itself.</p>

				<p>Yes, seecurity is getting more attention than it was.  But expecting to get to a system that has non-repudiation everywhere seems rather too optimistic even if one wwanted to start from scratch, and though one could get a replacement deployed.</p>
<p>When we did IPv6, we started out trying to mandate support (not even use, just support) for IPSec in every system.  The mandate was simply ignored.  Eventually, recognizing reality, it was removed.</p>
<p>The good news is that a lot of applications are using TLS by default.  But that does not give you the system-wide coverage that is really needed for this sort of thing.</p>

				<p>@ The usual suspects,</p>
<p>Note,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;There is currently not enough available evidence to link the cluster’s activity to a specific country-nexus.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Nor if the cluster is doing it&#8217;s job[1] should there be, unless it is made to look like it&#8217;s coming from somewhere else.</p>
<p>I guess the US side of things is finally waking up to,</p>
<p><b>Attribution is hard, very hard.</b></p>
<p>I wonder if they are also waking up to,</p>
<p><b>False Flag Operations are not hard, not hard at all.</b></p>
<p>Likewise considering what the implications of those two combined is&#8230;</p>
<p>@ ALL,</p>
<p>But is this realy news?</p>
<p>We know Level III attackers such as the NSA have been intercepting certain academics and consultants Emails in Europe for years.</p>
<p>Would it realy be any surprise that they would be extending their scope, as technology reduces cost of action, and increased budget gives rather more ability to &#8220;reduce cost&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>A little bird has told me that over in Germany, Level III entity priorities have just been &#8220;reassessed&#8221;. No doubt simillar will follow in other places.</p>
<p>[1] On the loose assumption they are &#8220;working stiffs&#8221; / &#8220;Salary men&#8221; at a Level III adversary. Be it Corporate or State cutting the monthly checks.</p>

				<p>TOR, VPN, etc don&#8217;t really solve the problem here.  Your network, be it internet, TOR, or avian carrier, is only as secure as the software it is running on. It doesn&#8217;t matter how secure your data is in transit, if your device is compromised.</p>
<p>The ONLY way this problem will get fixed is if software &#8220;engineers&#8221; and the companies they work for are made liable for the damages caused by their shitty products, like EVERY other industry.</p>
<p>Your ketchup just poisoned a million people?  The wheels fell off your truck?  Your building collapsed, killing thousands?  Pay a huge fine, class action and/or go to jail.  Your shitty software allowed a hospital to be hacked, costing millions of dollars in damages and ending three lives?  Oh, the hospital should have done better.  This is victim blaming at it&#8217;s finest!</p>

				<p>@Clive<br />
&#8220;&gt; My question is, what are the obstacles?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;1, Social, 2, Political, 3, Criminal, 4, Economic, 5, Technical, 6, Other.&#8221;</p>
<p>1-3 are not interesting to me<br />
4 I can think of a mobile phone + tablet setup that would be (well) under €1000.</p>
<p>To me, 5&amp;6 are of interest. What would subvert a setup with Signal+Email+VPN/TOR?</p>

				<p>I think we need to be able to send someone with an axe to cut ALL Internet access from a specific region or country on short notice.</p>
<p>Specifically, when Some Country attacks Another Country in the near future, we need to be able to block all Some Country&#8217;s traffic immediately to at least have a chance of surviving their hacking into our infrastructure and critical systems.</p>
<p>We also need to make sure that the operators of all this infrastructure and critical systems have been motivated to check their systems for logic bombs and other planted problems like malware, back doors etc. that Some Country has implanted to bring us to our knees when they attack the other Country.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be interesting.</p>

<p>&#8220;My question is, what are the obstacles?&#8221;</p>
<p>The main one is that the International Telecommunications Union is a union of governments, not of people. Effectively, the ITU&#8217;s a diplomatic body, and it acts (VERY SLOWLY) in the interests of the member governments. It has no brief to act in the interests of ordinary people. It is almost completely unlike the IETF.</p>

<p>Yeah. Ain&#8217;t going to happen.</p>
<p>Loads of the comments up-thread are going on about TOR, VPNs and TCP. This is an attack on <em>telecoms</em> infrastructure, not on IP networks. That is often not private organisations. The protocols they share are agreed by diplomats, who are only advised by engineers, not instructed by them.</p>
<p>No government really wants secure communications infrastructure. Their intel agencies wouldn&#8217;t stand for it. How would the CIA feel about their diplomats agreeing to more secure infrastructure in Iran, Israel, Russia, China? But telecom is now fully international, you can&#8217;t have secure infrastructure in the USA unless <em>everyone</em> gets it, everywhere.</p>
<p>Secure communication isn&#8217;t that hard; find a field, stand in the middle, and whisper.</p>
<p>Encryption is groovy, and all that; but most people don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s been done right, or whether it works at all, or whether it&#8217;s been broken. If you want to keep secrets, use telecom as a channel for establishing security. &#8220;Which field do you want to meet in, specifically?&#8221;</p>

				<blockquote><p>LightBasin’s focus on Linux and Solaris systems is likely due [&#8230;..] to the comparatively lax security measures and monitoring solutions on Linux/Solaris systems that are typically in place on Windows operating systems within an organization.</p></blockquote>
<p>Somebody had to say it sooner or later. Is it because Windows is assumed to be cheap commodity crud and needs to be securely bolted down, while Linux/Solaris is just assumed to be OK? Surely the telecomms industry must have grown out of the mindset that you can see and/or hear a wiretap on a physical line. Do they then assume that &#8220;free&#8221; &#8220;open source&#8221; means you don&#8217;t have to pay the right price for quality security?</p>
<p>My personal banking and medical data are unlikely to be of interest to LightBasin, but it still confounds my bank and doctor when I refuse to use their &#8220;app&#8221;.</p>

				<p>Personally I believe the propogation of human rights abuse over telecoms systems is the bigger worry. Speaking of which according to usually reliable sources one known bad actor who has effectively been banned by the highest levels of the United Nations was unmasked online this week hiding behind a false identity. There was also a slip up by the office of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom as a very suspect communication by Downing Street surfaced. A few high profile politicians and one member of the privvy council were caught red handed being wrapped up in or co-opted into the broader problem.</p>
<p>Social media especially US social media is a very big problem. Currently management shout about privacy while the legal environment in the US is the company owns your data. While it is not directly said you can see from what is withheld and what is said there is a bias in favour of commerical interest and deflecting regulatory or legal action, and hiding behind known weak or flawed oversight mechanisms.</p>
<p>There are a lot of technical and sociological and neuro-psychological feedback loops in this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible to take Bruce&#8217;s post as a model and rewrite everything I have said to fit the clipped formality.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say attribution is necssarily difficult even with layers of reactive proxies. It can be more of a messy thing. None of these intelligence reports properly dwell on this in their conclusions which creates more questions&#8230;</p>

				<p>Hmmm&#8230;.</p>
<p>I am seeing ping times of 341ms more or less. Often source is obscured [made to appear local].</p>
<p>Suggests Japan and China to me.</p>
<p>Does computer security exist?</p>
<p>A simple, easy to audit, AES SIP 2 way p2p client in assembly code on a simple micro would be a good beginning.</p>
<p>In the earlier days if ping time was &gt;150ms connection was refused.</p>
<p>Lots of fun :).</p>

				<p>@ Winter,</p>
<p>I note you now have two comments (7:40 &amp; 8:23) that end in a</p>
<blockquote><p>what are the obstacles?</p></blockquote>
<p>Question, my original reply was to the first.</p>
<p>Which states,</p>
<blockquote><p>That way I should be able to combine mobile phone level flexibility with the “best available security”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well in the &#8220;technical&#8221; asspect your above indicates you are assuning a computer is the &#8220;best available security&#8221; it is not, not by a very very long way.</p>
<p>Nearly all commercial applications and OS&#8217;s these days, the main stream one&#8217;s in particular are</p>
<p>1, Not even remotely secure by design, in fact the opposite.<br />
2, Have &#8220;ET phone home&#8221; spyware as standard called &#8220;Telemetry&#8221;.</p>
<p>But also in some cases the company that supplies your computer load on their own &#8220;Spyware / tracking&#8221; for &#8220;security&#8221;. Oh and we know the SigInt agencies also get at &#8220;packages in transit&#8221; so &#8220;online acquisition&#8221; is best avoided</p>
<p>One the phone side the same applies but you need to also throw in the service supplier&#8230; Anyone else remember CarrierIQ in the US, phoning home with your every action and key stroke?</p>
<p>The reason for all this surveillance crap is neo-con and MBA mantras that lead to &#8220;money on the table&#8221; thinking by these corporations. They believe and argue to legislators in the US why they have the &#8220;right&#8221; to do this, so far the EU has not brought the hammer down under the GDPR which isca shame.</p>
<p>So the top level thinking in the production side of hardware and software is &#8220;security is in the way of profit&#8221; and the US legislators in particular for two reasons see it as good,</p>
<p>1, Because they get taken care of by the corporations.<br />
2, Because the government entities tell them such things are desirable to fight XXX.</p>
<p>So none of the software nor hardware it runs on is in any way secure.</p>
<p>But as I&#8217;ve explained and our host @Bruce has explained you have to look at &#8220;the weakest link&#8221; not the strongest in any system.</p>
<p>Currently everyone talks about &#8220;secure messaging apps&#8221; like signal that yes does have some strong crypto in it, but it has no security by design. It keeps the crypto to it&#8217;s communications, not anything else it does or the rest of the system does.</p>
<p>Users hear what they want to hear which is &#8220;secure messaging&#8221; not the reality that the system has no security thus &#8220;secure messaging&#8221; is altogether pointless. It&#8217;s like tying a Gordian Knot in a steel hauser and tying a bit of string across it and using the string with a massive dead weight in the middle to lift things&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes you are actually less secure with a secure messaging app than you are without one&#8230;</p>
<p>If you want real securiry then you need to &#8220;Get off the consumer technology&#8221; and go back to basics.</p>
<p>And that &#8220;go back to basics&#8221; is another issue of significant failure that of &#8220;Operational Security&#8221;(OpSec) it&#8217;s the human side of security and it is no easy task to get right few can, most do not want to bother, they are lazy and just do not care. But worse technology like CCTV works against you, things are &#8220;totaly recorded&#8221; they are nolonger ephemeral. Those recordings can be analysed over and over from now untill long after you are dead, and it won&#8217;t be long before the likes of</p>
<p>1, Identity recognition systems<br />
2, Location systems<br />
3, Health / biomedic systems<br />
4, AI / ML sysyems</p>
<p>Get linked together as a coherant whole, to notice paterns, link them together and form inteligence sources to LEO&#8217;s, IC / Mil entitiesit&#8217;s and other commercial entities. It&#8217;s what is going on at Palantir Technologies set up by Internet Billionair Peter Thiel, and chums Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, Alex Karp in Colorado back in 2003.</p>
<p>Basically &#8220;total surveillance no questions asked, guilt served on a screen&#8221;.</p>
<p>The thing is you can quite innocently be in the wrong place at the wrong time. You don&#8217;t know it in most if not all cases as nobody remembers seeing you there and you do not get to hear about what went &#8220;wrong&#8221;. Even if you do see what went wrong, most don&#8217;t consciously remember they look away and they dont stop and tell because &#8220;It ain&#8217;y my business&#8221;. In some peoples eyes that is &#8220;running away from the scene of a crime&#8221; and &#8220;innocent people don&#8217;t run&#8221;. To be &#8220;guilty&#8221; all that has to be done is find you have some circumstantial connection with what went wrong&#8230; The bad news is everyone has circumstantial connection to their local in more ways than they can appriciate. We&#8217;ve all heard about the &#8220;six steps of connectedness&#8221; that says you are six or less human connections from someone famous, well the same applies to places and events such as things that went &#8220;wrong&#8221;. The closer they are the less steps the more guilty you look.</p>
<p>Now imagine a computer algorithm that simply follows links and establishes those steps for a group of people whos mobile phone or other location information puts them in the geo-temporal local. It then sorts the list by least steps, and those are &#8220;the suspects&#8221;&#8230; Now what about electronic traffic, it&#8217;s another dimension, you send an encrypted data packet into a route hiding network around the time a wrong event happens, what are the circumstantial steps there?</p>
<p>We already know that a student used Tor around the time a bomb threat arived on campus, he became suspect number one just on circumstance&#8230;</p>
<p>The student then under interogation apparently admitted it&#8230; But with the US plea system and FBI history, lets just say they have driven people to suicide and false confession way to often.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/runasandvik/2013/12/18/harvard-student-receives-f-for-tor-failure-while-sending-anonymous-bomb-threat/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.forbes.com/sites/runasandvik/2013/12/18/harvard-student-receives-f-for-tor-failure-while-sending-anonymous-bomb-threat/</a></p>
<p>That event was more than seven years ago, think how much more can be dug out these days. Then add in there are now new tor services such as time shifting remailers etc. So just accessing tor some time before makes you look guilty. As for visiting a &#8220;Coffee Shop&#8221; with CCTV coverage these days you can be linked by your cloths you left home in, facial recognition is not required&#8230;</p>
<p>Maybe if they do not already exist somebody should start a &#8220;Pocket Burqa in a bag&#8221; product line much like &#8220;Pac A Mac&#8221; and more recently &#8220;Pac A Mask&#8221;&#8230;</p>

				<p>@ JohnnyS,</p>
<blockquote><p>Specifically, when Some Country attacks Another Country in the near future, we need to be able to block all Some Country’s traffic immediately to at least have a chance of surviving their hacking into our infrastructure and critical systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>It won&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>I could list some of the very many reasons but consider this,</p>
<p>I set up a computer in a closset somewhere in &#8220;another country&#8221; on which I&#8217;ve installed a zero day worm waiting to be released at some future point unknown.</p>
<p>To it I add an HF Radio Modem which is receive only. I send it an encrypted and encoded plaintext message every so often[1]. One message type is a &#8220;stay alive&#8221; that acts as a &#8220;deadmans switch&#8221;, that is as long as the message is sent the worm is not released. The other message type is a &#8220;release now&#8221;.</p>
<p>It matters not what external network connections from &#8220;some country&#8221; you cut HF Radio &#8220;skips over&#8221; that.</p>
<p>Look on it as a variation on a &#8220;trusted insider&#8221; attack. The only way you stop that zero day worm is by shutting down all internal networks in &#8220;another country&#8221; where that computer in a closet is located.</p>
<p>For various reasons, the more technically sophisticated a country is the more reliant it is on insecure networks.</p>
<p>Think about what would happen if the Internet and phone networks went out entirely in the US, then some third world country with little or no communications infrastructure. Remember,</p>
<p><b>Technology is the Achilles heel of the modern world.</b></p>
<p>Not the third world.</p>
<p>[1] I&#8217;ve discussed these innocuous looking messages that carry payload that can not be deduced or demonstrated by a third party before.</p>

<blockquote><p>Somebody had to say it sooner or later.</p></blockquote>
<p>*nix, got the telco gig long before Linux made it out of University.</p>
<p>The reasons &#8220;Hardware&#8221; and &#8220;Up Time&#8221; not security. In fact C2 did not come to any commercial *nix till long after *nix was entrenched in telcos.</p>
<p>And *nix is still holding the &#8220;Up Time&#8221; advantage on other widely used commercial OS&#8217;s to this day.</p>
<p>Microsoft OS&#8217;s based on NT are never realy going to be able to compeate on &#8220;Up Time&#8221; for a number of very fundemental reasons. I won&#8217;t go into them but only say they were pushed onto NT&#8217;s design by &#8220;Marketing&#8221; and so fundemental was the issue it critically effected the whole design architecture and inflicted the equivalent of a genetic hereditary disease on NT&#8230;</p>

				<p>@Denton Scratch, @msb @All</p>
<p>re: <i> The ONLY way this problem will get fixed is if software “engineers” and the companies they work for are made liable for the damages &#8230; </i></p>
<p>From a recent MSM article:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Boeing 737 Max chief technical pilot charged with deceiving US aviation regulators over MCAS</p>
<p>&emsp; He hasn&#8217;t got $2.5bn to hand to the DoJ, unlike his bosses</p>
<p>A Boeing 737 Max test pilot has been charged with obstructing US aviation safety regulators &#8230;  prosecutor claimed that [redacted] had supplied the FAA with &#8220;materially false, inaccurate, and incomplete information&#8221; about MCAS, the Manoeuvering Characteristics Augmentation System.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That section of the software keeps the nose of the plane level.  The 737 had a tendency to tilt, so they fixed it in the software instead of having the pilots do a constant leveling maneuver to hold the nose level.</p>
<p>Unfortunately and catastrophically, the system went TSUP and the pilots got into a fight with the computer over &#8220;What Level? is Level&#8221;.  Level ending up at Augered In.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of bad software, there&#8217;s a lot of software that&#8217;s bad because people didn&#8217;t know how to do better or because their bosses told them to do it THISWAYorTHEHIGHWAY.</p>
<p>In many systems it&#8217;s the directing mind that gets the blame.  Convicting and fining a computer hasn&#8217;t been too successful and computers have no problems sitting in SHU for 24&#215;7.  So they go up one or two or a dozen levels.</p>
<p>There are other items with equally devastating results, where going up two or a dozen levels is prohibited (USA). For these you can only go up one level at most and many times even that is prohibited (USA).</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Partial search terms:<br />
* Boeing 737 Max / US aviation regulators / MCAS</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say never, but I&#8217;m also not going to hold my breath.  Within the next couple hundred years we might have finally developed a good library of standard algorithms and codes of industry best practices much like engineering tables, if we can ever get past the giant steaming pile that is IP rights.</p>
<p>Yes, they are attacks on telecom infrastructure, but the attack vector is primarily Linux/Solaris systems on IP networks.  From inside, the telecom infrastructure is relatively secure, so China can&#8217;t actually use their telecom connections to exploit US carriers, which is why they need to come in out of band via IP networks.</p>
<p>I would disagree that secure communication is simple. Communication requires two (or more) people.  So you want to meet in a big empty field and whisper?  How are you going to tell me what field to meet at what time?  If you tell me that over the phone, now that information is compromised so someone knows what field to monitor and when to look there.</p>
<p>Meta-data can be as valuable as the data itself, especially if you can gather enough of it. without being able to see a single spot of ink, you can tell what a word says on a page by the shape of the white space around it.</p>
<p>People have been trying to secure communications for thousands of years, and nobody has perfected it yet.  At some point in time every single communication must exist in a state that can be understood and intercepted without exception, so security will always be a balance of usability and security.</p>
