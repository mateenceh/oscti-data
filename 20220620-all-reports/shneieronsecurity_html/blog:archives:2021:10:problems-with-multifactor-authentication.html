		<h2 class="entry">Problems with Multifactor Authentication</h2>
		<p>Roger Grimes on why multifactor authentication <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-majority-our-mfa-so-phishable-roger-grimes">isn&#8217;t a panacea</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first time I heard of this issue was from a Midwest CEO. His organization had been hit by ransomware to the tune of $10M. Operationally, they were still recovering nearly a year later. And, embarrassingly, it was his most trusted VP who let the attackers in. It turns out that the VP had approved over 10 different push-based messages for logins that he was not involved in. When the VP was asked why he approved logins for logins he was not actually doing, his response was, &#8220;They (IT) told me that I needed to click on Approve when the message appeared!&#8221;</p>
<p>And there you have it in a nutshell. The VP did not understand the importance (&#8220;the WHY&#8221;) of why it was so important to ONLY approve logins that they were participating in. Perhaps they were told this. But there is a good chance that IT, when implementinthe new push-based MFA, instructed them as to what they needed to do to successfully log in, but failed to mention what they needed to do when they were not logging in if the same message arrived. Most likely, IT assumed that anyone would naturally understand that it also meant not approving unexpected, unexplained logins. Did the end user get trained as to what to do when an unexpected login arrived? Were they told to click on &#8220;Deny&#8221; and to contact IT Help Desk to report the active intrusion?</p>
<p>Or was the person told the correct instructions for both approving and denying and it just did not take? We all have busy lives. We all have too much to do. Perhaps the importance of the last part of the instructions just did not sink in. We can think we hear and not really hear. We can hear and still not care.</p></blockquote>

				<p>I kind of understand the VP position.</p>
<p>Many system, not necessarily this one, are many times too complicated and flawed.</p>
<p>You can question them. Sometimes you get more insight into them. But far too many times the lesson learned is that you can’t change the flawed design.</p>
<p>So when a new system comes in and you don’t fully understand it, why bother questioning it.</p>

				<p>The one variation I’ve seen work is to give the user multiple choice and they have to select information currently on the screen. Like a dynamic two-digit code. An improvement to the design would be for the Deny/Approve buttons to be “I didn’t request this code” and “Confirm.”  Then the deny button results in a notification to the security team.</p>

				<p>At my work the IT group sends ‘test’ phishing emails. If you suspect it is a nefarious email, you click a button in Outlook that says ‘Report Phishing.’</p>
<p>You get an immediate pop up box that says “Good job…” if you caught on to their test. Otherwise, they say something to the effect of… thank you and they are looking into it. Then they follow up shortly telling you if the email is actually legit or if it was spam.</p>
<p>The only one I ever got tricked on was a work ‘pet costume contest’ email. When I clicked on a link, I got a popup box that said phishers often use emotional content like this.</p>
<p>Well i didn’t click on that email this year. But i still like cute pet costumes.</p>

				<p>At my organization we use Azure Active Directory for our IDP/MFA solution.  We spent months trying to develop clear descriptions of when users should receive MFA prompts.  The various configurations for token lifetimes did not seem to behave consistently.  We could force MFA every time at every sign in, but this was deemed unacceptable from a user experience perspective.  With token refresh cycle, if you keep your browser open you might go days without a fresh MFA prompt.  This story shows the importance of getting these descriptions into language the users can understand.  Maybe it would be easier if we described when they should NOT expect MFA prompts.</p>

				<blockquote><p>At my work the IT group sends ‘test’ phishing emails. If you suspect it is a nefarious email, you click a button in Outlook that says ‘Report Phishing.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Have the IT group ever tried putting a &#8220;Report Phishing&#8221; button inside the email? That&#8217;s how I&#8217;d phish a company after hearing about this policy. &#8220;Congratulations, you passed the test! Please enter your login to record your success.&#8221;</p>
<p>I used to have ssh-agent/gpg-agent set up to prompt for confirmation, but that turns to be a pain in the ass for various reasons. The prompt never said what program was requesting access or why; often I&#8217;d started and mostly forgotten about some background task a minute ago. The default button was &#8220;yes&#8221;, so often I&#8217;d press Enter from some unrelated typing and accidentally allow it anyway. The &#8220;confirmation&#8221; setting was completely ignored for ed25519 keys. And if I were ssh&#8217;d into the machine, the prompt would sometimes appear on a different ssh session; I&#8217;d be sitting there like an idiot wondering why my command was hanging.</p>
<p>My bank does an automated phonecall for web-banking 2FA. Apart from sucking in general (insecure, and problematic while traveling), it reads the code before saying what it&#8217;s for. &#8220;Your access code is&#8230; 1..2..3..4..5..6&#8230; for your&#8230; login&#8221;—and I&#8217;m always glad it didn&#8217;t say &#8220;giant wire transfer&#8221; at the end, because by then I&#8217;ve already typed the code. Dammit, Unnamed Bank, use TOTP or better yet my debit (smart)card as the second factor. (Even the old-school method of a printed and mailed set of codes is better than a phonecall or text.) Worse, when I need to phone the bank for whatever reason, the second factor is my birthdate or account balance or some shit like that. (&#8220;I&#8217;m logged into your site right now; can&#8217;t you just send me a random code via that site?&#8221;—&#8221;No.&#8221;)</p>

				<p>One part of a problem is reliance on customer- or employee-owned devices. Big organizations have to implement the least common denominator technique (such as plaintext SMS) or issue their own devices, which induces extra costs and annoys customers, who expect to have their whole life being dependent on one shiny rectangle in their pocket. Carrying an extra gizmo is out of question for them.</p>
<p>Many years ago a company I worked at issued physical tokens as 2FA for remote access authentication. Then, after a blunder at the well-known token company, for an inexplicable reason they refused to issue a replacement physical token when the current one expired, but told me to go with software token from the same company instead. However, I did not have any device the software would run on. Well, what goes out, must come back in, so I hacked up my own remote access channel (arguably, even more secure than the original one). I left the company some time after that.</p>
<p>Banks used to issue hardware tokens in the past; now they don&#8217;t, even if you agree to pay extra. Very few issue OTPs still, which I consider safer than SMS &#8211; you can&#8217;t remotely hack (think SIM-swap) a piece of paper or plastic. Now the choice is between SMS (sometimes) and an app with push notofications.</p>
<p>I still refuse to own and carry a &#8220;smart&#8221; phone, but accept the tradeoffs connected to carrying a &#8220;dumb&#8221; phone &#8211; which I can switch off and on as needed.</p>

				<p>So I ready the referenced LinkedIn post, and watched Kevin&#8217;s video (I wondered what became of him).<br />
WHERE DOES THAT SSH SESSION COME FROM?</p>
<p>He just presents it as a <i>fait accompli</i></p>
<p>Well, duh. If you can monitor traffic or have some other sniffer running, of course it can compromise a session.</p>
<p>While I agree with the point that all MFA is hackable, this demo is uncomfortably close to snake oil.</p>

				<p>@Fred: My employer has inflicted KnowBe4&#8217;s training videos on us in the past.  They&#8217;re not the worst I&#8217;ve ever seen, but they&#8217;re far from good. One year the annual training told us that the only safe email attachment type was .TXT, which was always safe to click on.  Thankfully the next year&#8217;s version had that particular bit of foolishness removed.  I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s been a year yet where I didn&#8217;t say at some point, &#8220;I know which answer they want me to select.  And I know which answer is <em>correct</em>.&#8221;  Would not recommend.  Though they do provide an afternoon&#8217;s worth of bemusement around the water cooler / slack channel as people compare wtfs.</p>

<p>This is a generic/strategic problem across the board. Only this past year there is some information I needed to propograte through the UK state administrative system. For one reason or another I have run into protocols and policies and implementation including individual interpretations of what should be done or how people believe the system does or should work and little focus on the &#8220;why&#8221;. Add in multiple departments and individual interpretations of law etcetera&#8230; It all gets a bit messy and circular.</p>
<p>This week I decided to activate a protocol with security and national security policy relevance. (It&#8217;s not a fraction as dramatic as it sounds.) The information I passed on, on reflection, lacked one component which normally should be implied so I thought I would get ahead of this. Thankfully the staff I dealt with were helpful which saved resubmitting information.</p>
<p>The annoying thing was I couldn&#8217;t get things done on the phone because&#8230; national security. On the plus side if anyone wants to cause a mischief&#8230; national security.</p>

				<p>As a follow up: I forgot to add the protocol I invoked involves roots of trust and multi-factor security of various forms.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, on a not directly related issue I also gained lawful access to another system today. There are security checks in place within this system. Getting that sorted out involved passing security checks elsewhere which I organised some months ago so when system X talked to system Y it didn&#8217;t throw a hissy fit. Other similar systems have additional gold plating for political reasons with no supporting law and no published risk analysis even when their gold plating contradicts authoritative published opinion by a relevant regulator.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not even going to bother writing up the red faced bulging eyes empire building hissy fits if you have the temerity to fill in a complaint fom.</p>

				<p>Panacea?  MFA isn&#8217;t even a good idea, and I wish security professionals would stop pretending it is.  Certainly the VP isn&#8217;t without blame, but the biggest error is trying to externalize the cost of security on to someone who has no expertise in that field.  If your authentication process <em>requires</em> users to do absolutely everything right at all times, you&#8217;ve done a poor job of architecting your system.</p>
<p>I mean, take those 10 mistaken MFA approvals.  I&#8217;m 100% certain that there were <em>many</em> signs that the activity was suspicious (e.g., access via foreign IPs), but that information was probably completely ignored.  Likewise, no single person should be trusted to the extent that apparently this VP was over the operation of their <em>entire</em> IT infrastructure.  If that was a management decision, the CEO bears a significant portion of the blame, too.</p>

				<p>The paragraphs that Bruce quotes talk about &#8220;push-based MFA&#8221;. That method has a huge fundamental flaw in that the second factor is sent over a side channel. The authentication is decoupled from the session. I can&#8217;t understand how anyone can think that&#8217;s a good idea. Obviously authentication must be done in the session that is to to be authorized.</p>
<p>The Swedish proprietary BankID protocol has this flaw, and it enabled an outbreak of fraud a few years ago. The attacker would call the victim and say something confidence-inspiring. They might for example claim to be calling from the bank or the police. Then they&#8217;d ask the victim to prove their identity, while at the same time attempting to log in to the victim&#8217;s bank account. The bank would then send an authentication request to the victim&#8217;s BankID app. The victim, ho had just been told to expect this, would approve the authentication, and the attacker was then logged into the victim&#8217;s bank account.</p>
<p>The banks eventually worked around the design flaw by displaying a QR code in the web interface to be read by the BankID app, which links the side channel to the session, but using the QR code is optional on the server side. The BankID cartel has been pushing rather successfully for their proprietary protocol to be used for authentication everywhere, and various other places still use it in fraud-inviting mode.</p>

				<p>@ Fred, ALL</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; watched Kevin’s video (I wondered what became of him)</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin Mitnick is still around but he&#8217;s getting on for 60, so he&#8217;s probably slowing down a bit, like many a body around here 😉 I here however he&#8217;s still handing out &#8220;lock pick business cards&#8221;.</p>
<p>His tie up with KnowBe4 back in 2012 did provide some fun reading[1] in the trade press and even MSM,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;The biggest risks to information security are the people. Studies have shown that most security incidents start from within, and are usually accidental,&#8221; explained Mitnick, citing the use of social engineering tactics by cybercriminals. &#8220;All it takes is one person making a bad decision to compromise the entire business.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>So not much has changed in the past decade, if not way longer&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that &#8220;one person&#8230;bad decision&#8221; aspect, that makes one of the first questions I ask,</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the business case for having that system connected to the Internet&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, when you clear away the MBA Mantras, there often is no real business case at all other than in some limited cases &#8220;cost reductions&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which brings up another major issue,  &#8220;short term risk&#8221; the &#8220;It ain&#8217;t going to happen next quater, but bonuses are&#8221; thinking that pervades much senior managment means in reality there is little or no buy-in to any real security no mater how many C-suit Execs &#8220;mouth the mantras&#8221;</p>
<p>The attitude is &#8220;Money not spent on costs is there to make profit&#8221; or the old &#8220;Money left on the table&#8221; reasoning. Which actually pervades the US almost every where you go, you can see it in all the infrastructure with &#8220;bodge job repairs&#8221; and &#8220;lowest bid maintainence&#8221;.</p>
<p>I suspect that some living in South / West states who have had utility crisis after utility crisis year after year, will be stuned to hear that in London and the South East of England utility outages are so rare they come as a major shock. The same with many other places in Europe.</p>
<p>Near where I was born, back in the early 1950&#8217;s they put up electrcity pylons. I know that for atleast the last 50years they have not given any problems and needed very little maintainence. Similarly major underground cables in SW London. The usuall cause of problems is &#8220;JCB Jimbo&#8221; digging a trench where he should not be and going through armoured cables &#8220;eventually&#8221; (Yup it&#8217;s rare for them to do it without lots of warning signs they just ignore).</p>
<p>It would be unfair of me to say &#8220;The US is falling appart&#8221; because there are worse places in the world. I just happen not to reside in them and the poverty that results from such short term thinking.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let others say what they think is good or bad, but seriously an outage once a decade for a utillity where I live is considered to be unacceptable.</p>
<p>[1] Took me a while to find the quote,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kevin-mitnick-partners-with-knowbe4-159403195.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kevin-mitnick-partners-with-knowbe4-159403195.html</a></p>
<p>I remember thinking at the time &#8220;tell me something I don&#8217;t know&#8221; as I&#8217;d got tired telling it to others knowing full well it would go in one ear, followed by a knee jerk tick in the checkbox, then straight out the other ear&#8230;</p>
