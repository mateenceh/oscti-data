		<h2 class="entry">Textbook Rental Scam</h2>
		<p>Here&#8217;s a story of <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/15/amazon_textbook_rental/">someone</a> who, with three compatriots, rented textbooks from Amazon and then sold them instead of returning them. They used gift cards and prepaid credit cards to buy the books, so there was no available balance when Amazon tried to charge them the buyout price for non-returned books. They also used various aliases and other tricks to bypass Amazon&#8217;s fifteen-book limit. In all, they stole 14,000 textbooks worth over $1.5 million.</p>
<p>The article doesn&#8217;t link to the indictment, so I don&#8217;t know how they were discovered.</p>

				<p>Hmmm&#8230;. Fun to watch Amazon and friends try to convince the world that paper books are still of ANY interest!</p>
<p>I can always show up with a memory stick with a pdf and have paper if I REALLY need it?</p>
<p>I give away a memory stick with 5GB of books on &#8216;soil and health&#8217;. Most of the worthwhile stuff on it was written many years before I was born and the &#8216;word processor&#8217; did not exist and authors had something really important experience to share with their neighbors.</p>
<p>The recent authors who have something real to share, mostly release their stuff free from copyright!!</p>
<p>Lots of fun :).</p>

				<p>“According to the indictment, from January 2016 to March 2021, Talsma rented thousands of textbooks from Amazon’s Textbook Rental Program…”</p>
<p>You do wonder what Amazon’s threshold for detection is, if these guys stole 14,000 books worth $1.5 million over 5 years.</p>
<p>My school professors created their own textbook. We can either order a paper copy thru the school bookstore or an e-copy through the publisher. The cost is around $20 for either option, which is a completely reasonable price. Thankful for that.</p>
<p>I did order a separate kit from Amazon for the class. They said it was delivered, but I never received it. Amazon customer service was able to send me a replacement at no charge. I  did wonder how they knew I was being honest about it. But the kit was also around $20, and I’ve only had this happen once so I was hoping it didn’t trigger any red flags. I see a lot of people on the social media site “Nextdoor” who don’t receive their Amazon packages or receive someone else’s packages by mistake.</p>

				<p>@John</p>
<p>The books have value because students need them to pass their classes. Imagine that your professor instructs you to read pages 125-140 and do questions 1-10 on page 142. An equally good textbook will be useless for this task.</p>
<p>To make things worse, the textbooks tend to have sections rearranged and problems slightly altered every few years to ensure that students must keep buying new textbooks.</p>
<p>The best solution I have seen was to buy a textbook, scan/photograph the relevant pages, then return it for a full refund within a few days. Most university bookstores will allow you to do this.</p>

&#8220;Hmmm…. Fun to watch Amazon and friends try to convince the world that paper books are still of ANY interest!&#8221;</p>
<p>Studying from paper is preferred by many people. And handling a stack of hundreds of pages you printed yourself is not always an option.</p>
<p>That said, textbook prices tended to be ridiculous and teachers forcing students to buy the textbooks written by themselves (every year a new edition) is a scam that should fall under &#8220;abuse of power&#8221;.</p>

<p>The school libraries will usually let you do the same, but letting you skip the &#8220;buy/return the book&#8221; steps.</p>

				<p>@Me</p>
<p>That strategy may have depended on where you went to school. At my university the libraries officially had 1-2 copies of each textbook, and I never saw one on a shelf (despite no one being allowed to check them out). I suspect that students were hiding them so that they could access them without any competition.</p>

				<p>I retired back to college.  I rediscovered what a scam textbook publishers operate.  I do not sympathize with textbook publishers.<br />
I&#8217;m particularly offended by textbooks that cannot be purchased but can only be rented.  The story doesn&#8217;t say whether these textbooks were available for purchase.  If they were not, then I begin to sympathize with the resisters.</p>

				<p>@Winter: teachers forcing students (or their parents actually) to buy new textbooks is one little problem you can often avoid. The government forcing it is much bigger issue &#8211; probably not in the USA, but elsewhere it happens very often. Then the government offers subsidies &#8220;for textbooks&#8221; but they&#8217;re insufficient, of course, and the taxation wasteloop grows and grows&#8230; As a father of three I see it very acutely.</p>

				<p>Many professors have already made their own quality textbooks available as free pdfs. Wisconsin.edu has one such program. ocw.mit.edu is another. I have taken courses from them.</p>
<p>They are of amazing quality. I did Organic Chemistry. Learned a lot.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t need textbooks or going to campus unless I have &#8216;extra&#8217; money to burn.</p>
<p>Cornell.edu has &#8220;the&#8221; geochemical textbook as an open on-line book. It was a VERY interesting read. I would not have guessed that plants select certain molecules with particular istopes rather than just looking for elements or molecules!</p>
<p>I have not read that anywhere else? Have you?</p>
<p>Lots of fun :).</p>

				<p>@ John,</p>
<blockquote><p>I would not have guessed that plants select certain molecules with particular istopes </p></blockquote>
<p>Indicating that either or both of the following are true,</p>
<p>1, Some living organisms are sensitive to quantum effects.</p>
<p>2, The isotopes of the sane atom have sufficiently different chenical properties.</p>
<p>Untill fairly recently it was geberally assumed by biologists that 1 was not possible, even though physicists have been investigating it for nearky a cebtury, and the likes of mathmatician Roger Penrose have suggested that cognition is infact a quantum effect at some level. Indicating not only that there is evidence for it but that there were certain structures&#8230;</p>
<p>One piece of evidence that started a long running argument was the orange-mint flavour issue in olfaction. It lead researchers to believe first tast and later smell detect not chemicals by their reactions, but by what is in effect their frequency spectra (resonance).</p>
<p>Since then other probable quantum effects in biology have been hypothesized to the point now where most just accept it and are waiting for definitive proof. Which might be some time coming as some effects are in the low femtoseconds (1e-15( where light only travels (0.3um) a um or two. Whist we can under some circumstances measure quite a way down in um, those circumstances are not yet in biology.</p>

<p>@John</p>
<p>C re: <i> Many professors have already made their own quality textbooks available as free pdfs.  </i></p>
<p>A: Eons back when struggling through college, I did not have the funds to buy and extremely expensive book and checked out an older edition from the library. I explained the constraints to the Prof.  The Prof was less than sympathetic and said I was On-My-Own to find the references and risked failing exams because the older book did not have the new content.</p>
<p>Hotdogs became my diet for a long time after I bought the newer book. Worse, when the buy back happened that book was Not On The Buyback listing. I was stuck for the funds.</p>
<p>B: Not all libraries carry text books and loads of them do not hold textbooks because the are part of a financial churn between Profs and Publishers.  Any current edition in the library is &#8220;money on the table&#8221;.</p>
<p>Even library book donation drives have &#8220;no textbooks&#8221; requests. I figure it&#8217;s because the textbook authors rarely include any answers or decent examples in the book;  relying on their lectures so they don&#8217;t bother to include them.</p>
<p>C: Depending on where you are and the way the U system is setup (in the USA each state and district and public v private have their own deals), Profs get brownie points for &#8220;publishing&#8221; towards their tenure-track and their credentials.  Publish or Die is the by word.  Even publishing won&#8217;t help as many educational systems have dumped their tenure track and dupe PhD/MA-MS candidates that they will benefit if they sign up for it.  They find out at the 7/8th mile marker their services are no longer needed.</p>
<p>There are excellent pdfs but many of those are from folks who have already Made It through the academic roundabouts.  Even fiction writers are sensitive to &#8220;free pdfs&#8221;.  The digital conversion and reading-as-rental-income has helped.</p>
<p>Give a check on the &#8220;overdrive&#8221; contracts for your local library to see how that&#8217;s gated. You maybe able to compare the local contract with another city and see how it shakes out.</p>

				<p>@John, Clive:</p>
<p>Isotope selectivity in plants is certainly news to me!</p>
<p>I only learned chemistry to the &#8220;comic book&#8221; level; I&#8217;m used to thinking of chemical properties as governed by valence electrons.</p>
<p>I note (without understanding any chemical implications) that for the relatively light elements abundant in biology, the difference in molecular mass between isotopes is well over one percent.</p>
<p>Anyway, from a quick search it seems that isotope selectivity in redox reactions is a known phenomenon, but I didn&#8217;t yet see an explanation for the mechanism.  Perhaps in the electric fields of redox, differential mobility comes into play?</p>
<p>In connection to isotope-selective uptakes by plants, I saw references to iron and copper.</p>
<p>There are vast libraries filled with what I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<blockquote><p>I would not have guessed that plants select certain molecules with particular istopes rather than just looking for elements or molecules!</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow! I had never heard that! That is interesting! I am studying organic chemistry right now. Next semester is physics if all goes well.</p>
<p>Do you think there is something about certain topics that lend themselves to being open source vs. expensive?</p>
<p>The textbook titles the Register article mentions are &#8220;Compensation” and Economics.” Do you think these were the subjects of interest to the scammers or that this was more of a commentary by the author?</p>

&#8220;2, The isotopes of the sane atom have sufficiently different chenical properties.&#8221;</p>
<p>IIRC it is a thermodynamic thing generally having to do with mass fractioning between phases, liquid/gas, or height. I am not aware of (bio-)chemical reactions that are sensitive to the mass of isotopes. But my knowledge of this stuff is seriously outdate, I assume.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why the article mentioned those particular books &#8230; but I do remember my shock when a friend told me that his classmate from college days had just received a $1,000,000 <em>advance</em> to write an Econ textbook.  That was in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Before those Economics students attend their first lecture or open their crisp new textbooks, they are already getting lessons on the topics of Captive Markets and Monopoly Rent Theory!</p>

				<p>@ Winter,</p>
<blockquote><p>But my knowledge of this stuff is seriously outdate, I assume.</p></blockquote>
<p>You are not the only one, you can be assured of that Quantum-Biology is one of those fields where striding is still common 😉</p>
<p>Whilst it is not quite the first thing that crosses my mind in the morning&#8230; Being &#8220;seriously out of date&#8221; is one of two usual thoughts that cross my mind when reading a newspaper on Public Transport&#8230;</p>
<p>The other thought being,</p>
<p><b>When are the bl@@dy idiots going to read and learn from history.</b></p>
<p>I guess it is a sign of old age, I shall probably soon start shaking my stick and muttering about &#8220;Kidds of today don&#8217;t know&#8230;&#8221; soon =(</p>
<p>However I take solace from the local Korean community. Koreans love children especially the little ones, and in most cases their faces light up when they see them. Just seeing some one become happy in such a simple way, makes me in turn happy. But as with any up there is a down, and in this case think of the wrinkles the smile is giving me&#8230;</p>
<p>It is now the simple things like watching a bright red ladybird/bug moving across a green leaf shortly after a gentle summer shower that make me shrug off the &#8220;melancholic brown study&#8221; after reading a newspaper.</p>
<p>More recently though what makes me realy smile, is an agressive robin in my garden in the morning. He lands on the handle of the wheel barrow to get at the water and be lord of all he surveys. If I&#8217;m sitting at the table by the french windows eating, he chirps aggressively, fluffs himself up and when he sees me looking back, he cocks his head backwards and gives me a boat load of stink-eye. On occasion he will flutter down to the windows sill and tap on the glass with his beak. But&#8230; The other week I&#8217;d left open the upstairs toilet window, and I heard noises. In the past a burglar climbed in that window, so with some trepidation and a handy saucepan I went and yanked open the door. Imagine my surprise on seeing not a burglar I good get a good swing in on, but a flurry of wings creating an angry buzz as the robin flew at my face like a 4lb cannon ball. Needless to say I ducked, and spent the next couple of hours chasing Mr Robin out of the house again&#8230; I guess there are no hard feelings from his side because he still perches agressively and gives me the stink-eye[1].</p>
<p>As they say &#8220;It&#8217;s the little things that are sent to try us&#8221; but it&#8217;s also a good way to do your cardio for the day 😉</p>
<p>[1] I guess when the weather turns which oddly it has not yet done, &#8211;bees are still buzzing at the third set of flowers on the blackberry bush&#8211; I&#8217;ll hang up a fat ball or something similar to see him and his almost but not quite invisable mate through inclement times, along with any other non migratory birds that find nature is not providing.</p>

				<p>@ Ted,</p>
<blockquote><p>There must be oodles and oodles of money to be made on the front end</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps not&#8230;</p>
<p>Let me put it this way most economics books are not worth the paper they are written on when it comes to real knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>However as propaganda for certain people they are worth more than they weigh in platinum.</p>
<p>So that million dollar up front fee was probably a bribe to write the right things&#8230;</p>
<p>You come up with a hypothesis that sounds good, and importantly makes it appear that greed is so necessary it should be 100% tax deductable, and it can not be disproved&#8230; then you will be in the gravy for not just life but some considerable time there after.</p>
<p>For certain people just one year of not paying tax would pay that 1 million back thousands of times over&#8230;</p>
<p>To those who think I&#8217;m being cynical, no, I&#8217;m not being cynical enough (the probably chucked in a ghost edittor from a Washington think tank to write much of it).</p>

				<p>Hmmmm&#8230;.</p>
<p>The book suggests they have different masses and therefore &#8216;ring&#8217; at different frequencies.</p>
<p>An electron or two come slamming through, the isotope &#8216;rings&#8217; at the right frequency with the right oriented magnetic field and some mostly unlikely transition, necessary to life, occurs?</p>
<p>Apparently you can detect Tempest like noise when plants are growing&#8230;.</p>
<p>The ultimate side channel!</p>
<p>Makes sense to me.</p>
<p>For further research look up the organic compound Germanium 132. Inorganic Germanium is VERY toxic. Organic Germanium 132 not at all!! It is thought to be the active ingredient in Turmeric and other Chinese Medicinal Herbs.</p>
<p>Keep your brain working, eat farm fresh alive food especially cabbage and carrots and raw eggs, meat and organs. Leave out the addictive Ultra Processed Foods.</p>
<p>Lots of fun :).</p>
