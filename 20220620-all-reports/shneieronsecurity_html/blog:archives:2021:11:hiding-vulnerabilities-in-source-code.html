		<h2 class="entry">Hiding Vulnerabilities in Source Code</h2>
		<p>Really interesting <a href="https://trojansource.codes/trojan-source.pdf">research</a> demonstrating how to hide vulnerabilities in source code by manipulating how Unicode text is displayed. It&#8217;s really clever, and not the sort of attack one would normally think about.</p>
<p>From Ross Anderson&#8217;s <a href="https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2021/11/01/trojan-source-invisible-vulnerabilities/">blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have discovered ways of manipulating the encoding of source code files so that human viewers and compilers see different logic. One particularly pernicious method uses Unicode directionality override characters to display code as an anagram of its true logic. We&#8217;ve verified that this attack works against C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, and Python, and suspect that it will work against most other modern languages.</p>
<p>This potentially devastating attack is tracked as CVE-2021-42574, while a related attack that uses homoglyphs –- visually similar characters –- is tracked as CVE-2021-42694. This work has been under embargo for a 99-day period, giving time for a major coordinated disclosure effort in which many compilers, interpreters, code editors, and repositories have implemented defenses.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://trojansource.codes/">Website</a> for the attack. Rust <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/11/01/cve-2021-42574.html">security advisory</a>.</p>
<p>Brian Krebs has a <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/11/trojan-source-bug-threatens-the-security-of-all-code/">blog post</a>.</p>

				<p>Anyone familiar with COBOL and dot matrix printers when trying to find the source of a ten page error report knows this problem.</p>
<p>Compiler vendors are fundamentally lazy. You see this through entire &#8220;compiler like&#8221; toolchains. You have designers of languages ignoring rationality and piling in function after gee whiz function while ignoring legal mandates such as equality law governing accessibility. The lack of regulatory oversight and remedy in law perpetuates this.</p>
<p>File under avoidable problem.</p>
<p>Reality is a concrete mattress disguised by avoidant language much as &#8220;beef&#8221; when people really mean dead cow. Hence &#8220;Not normally&#8221; &#8211; a horrible phrase often used by lawyers along with &#8220;that depends&#8221; and &#8220;with kind regards&#8221;. You can add it to the same list as politicians speak such as &#8220;endevour&#8221; and &#8220;pledge&#8221;.</p>
<p>See you same time next year for the some problem wearing different clothes.</p>

				<p>I used to have a long, angry Unicode Rant.</p>
<p>I would bring it out at the slightest provocation, expounding on the evils of lookalike characters and the possibility of deceptive source code with &#8216;fake-equality&#8217; of identifiers, of &#8216;meta&#8217; or control characters doing unexpected things to display of characters they&#8217;d never been meant to apply to,  about a multiplicity of different code sequences to denote the same character, about there being more than one &#8216;normalization form&#8217;, about its chaotic non-ordering, about its unused codepoints, about the way it was accumulated rather than designed and continued to mutate year after year after year when people were already using it, and about the way we had somehow gotten from the important business of actually communicating language somehow to the idiotic situation of worrying about whether users identified with the supposed ethnicity of abstract symbols that should never have had any kind of color associated with them in the first place and cataloging poop emoji.</p>
<p>We have ADULTS, spending their days cataloging poop emoji.  Anybody who cared about communicating language is now beating their heads against a wall and weeping.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ll spare you the long version of the screed.  The above is like a few reminders of things I can go on for pages about.</p>
<p>It was a good and important idea. It got sidetracked into something else and became a  juddering abomination.</p>
<p>So meta characters that can do unexpected things turn out to be a bad idea? So deceptive source code that displays different semantics to humans and compilers has been enabled?  Color me surprised.  I&#8217;ve been telling people so for decades!</p>

				<blockquote><p>We’ve verified that this attack works against C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, and Python,</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this really a problem with these languages? Aren&#8217;t they just behaving as described on the box, allowing code writers to think and comment in their own human language? Surely the problem is in the compilers/interpreters that allow nonfunctional inclusions in the code to perform naughty functions.</p>
<p>As @Clive suggests in <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/10/friday-squid-blogging-squid-game-has-a-cryptocurrency.html/#comment-391195"><br />
 #comment-391195</a> in the squid thread, the solution is to use sane filtering ahead of compilers/interpreters that are insane.</p>

				<p>@ ALL,</p>
<p>I posted on this earlier over on the current squid page.</p>
<p>Something similar came up last century when *nix went internationalzed. It was the *nix internationalization effort that gave rise to much that is now in Unicode&#8230;</p>
<p>Unfortunatly it looks like the bidirectional printing behaviour has remained.</p>
<p>For some reason of nearly all technical based domains the IT industry realy does not learn from it&#8217;s history&#8230;</p>
<p>Thinking back to when the *nix internationalisation was causing issues and what people did as work arounds back then is worth thinking about.</p>
<p>First off back then few &#8220;code editors&#8221; supported anything other than ASCII, and as far as I&#8217;m aware that is still true for the basic *nix editors of the time that are still around (ed / vi). Thus simply opening in RO mode with one should throw up a visual clue at code review.</p>
<p>There may also be a simple work around[1] for some source code to executable compiler &#8220;pipelines&#8221;,</p>
<p>1, Run all source code through a filter that converts Unicode to ASCII (many editors will have a “Save as ASCII” option anyway).</p>
<p>2, Run the filter output through the compiler pre-processor only, so you get code expansion etc.</p>
<p>Take that expanded pre-processor output and then do your code review on it…</p>
<p>[1] Not all compilers are going to have this issue, because they don’t accept “unicode source” as input. I have quite a number of &#8220;old&#8221; compilers and I know they only take &#8220;7bit clean&#8221; ASCII.</p>
<p>Why modern compilers do take Unicode by default is a bit of a mystery as well… They realy should not do so unless specifically told to with a “switch”. On the “least unexpected behaviour” principle and likewise the “No hidden behaviour” principle (which did cause older source code control systems to barf).</p>

				<p>@Yabba Dabba Don&#8217;t ..</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s Ken Thompson&#8217;s 1984 Turing Award paper &#8220;Reflections on trusting trust&#8221;, and it is the very first reference cited  in Nicholas and Ross&#8217; paper.</p>
<p>On reading the paper, my immediate thought is &#8220;Oh, bother&#8221;  .. well, that&#8217;s the cleaned up version.</p>
<p>When I worked on the display of interesting text (Japanese, Hebrew) on mainframe terminals (IBM 5550 family of terminals designed in Japan), the control characters were always displayed so you could always see the [SO/SI] characters sequences that changed how you interpreted the text. Very handy for debugging that feature.</p>

				<p>In the comments on Brian Krebs&#8217; article, someone links back to a very similar sounding issue discussed in Golang back in May 2017</p>
<p>h++ps://github.com/golang/go/issues/20209</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a long history of discoveries publicised by and/or attributed to people other than the first discoverer (h++ps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiple_discoveries): this might be another example.</p>

				<p>@lurker</p>
<p>Validate your data. This was one of the first things I was taught and I was known for writing bullet proof code.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t even read Clive&#8217;s comment before posting my own. Clive isn&#8217;t the only pebble on the beach and he&#8217;s began circling around putting engineers on a pedestal and beating up coders again.</p>
<p>Physicists do physics. Engineering is applied physics. Engineering doesn&#8217;t teach creativity or what should be done. It&#8217;s mostly a long list of rote learned formulas and sanity checks. This is not to put the formal and informal aspects of the discipline down. Just don&#8217;t put it on a pedastel.</p>
<p>This whole topic pivots around psychology. There is linear &#8220;here are the rules&#8221; which heads off &#8220;you shouldn&#8217;t/cannot do that&#8221;. Psychology is not rules is not laws. The brain stalls and misses the superset. A person coming at it from the point of creativity looks at the superset and dodges all the rules to get the outcome they desired.</p>
<p>If you rewind life back to when you were in school there is only so much school teaches. Some of it is formal and some of it is implied and some of it is sourced externally from the surrounding culture and parents and friends and other teachers and influencers. Snap back to the present and take this insight and apply it to where you are now.</p>
<p>Unlike engineers and engineers in QA departments coders don&#8217;t have the same proectections in law. They cannot just say &#8220;no&#8221; and halt the production line. That is a quick way to be fired and yes I have been fired more than once for doing it. On one occasion the MD even admitted that I had been wrongly fired by a middle manager but the &#8220;management line had to be upheld&#8221;. The other time after I opened by mouth during a board level meeting I was unceremoniously fired and the company later went bust for massive cost overruns on vanity projects I had warned them not to do. This was a company which spent £10,000 on desks and from outside the meeting room you could hear managers shouting and banging the desk, and where not a single woman in the whole building would say boo to a goose even though they knew it was nonsense. Except me, of course, but I&#8217;m stupid like that. It was a company which effectively printed money and it would have taken an imbecile for it to go bankrupt which is exactly what happened. There&#8217;s more stories of management corruption and strongarming I could write about and other organisations going bust and inadequate management being fired and fraud but things would ramble on.</p>

				<p>The simplest mitigation for a tool chain is likely to provide an &#8211;ascii-only flag. At a guess &gt;99% of code has no need for anything outside 7-bit ASCII, so just enforce that.</p>
<p>I suspect the majority of the exceptions are in string literals, which suggests a useful middle ground option. Even then, I&#8217;d consider a style rule that non-ASCII string literals should go in isolated translation units.</p>

				<p>Let&#8217;s all point fingers at Unicode, which should be a pure character set, and let text/word processors decide if and how they want to handle LTR/RTL. Sure, we should be able to write Arabic backwards if we want, after all some people (not just xkcd) think backwards English has some use. Even with the control characters there are still some text/word processors that cannot cleanly handle Arabic quotations embedded in English text. And while we&#8217;re at it, what about Unicode control characters for vertical scripts? W3C in its wisdom or otherwise has recommended html devices for displaying traditional Chinese, but there are still enough browsers out there that throw a hissy fit at it.</p>
<p>I had a little smile at Ken Thompson&#8217;s rotated character set for vertical graph axes, but PostScript could do it more cleanly by drawing the string in normal characters then rotating the whole string.</p>
<p>No, this problem is a compiler/interpreter problem. Most of them are pretty good at parsing white space, then extend that to invalid characters in valid places.</p>

				<p>@All</p>
<p>What do you all think about the Defense strategies listed for this vulnerability in the paper (on page 8)? Are any of these more or less effective?</p>
<p>One of them is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Therefore, a better defense might be to ban the use of unterminated Bidi override characters within string literals and comments. By ensuring that each override is terminated – that is, for example, that every LRI has a matching PDI – it becomes impossible to distort legitimate source code outside of string literals and comments.

				<p>@ lurker,</p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s all point fingers at Unicode, which should be a pure character set, and let text/word processors decide if and how they want to handle LTR/RTL.</p></blockquote>
<p>The issue is not just Unicode. The problem is &#8220;in band signaling&#8221; that is silent to the user, which is stupid.</p>
<p>Even ASCII has it&#8217;s control chars, with which you can print backwards and forwards as much as you want. It was after all how *nix &#8220;man pages&#8221; got their <b>Bold</b> titles on printers that lacked any kind of intensity control (nearly all serial printers and many parallel port printers going into the 1990&#8217;s).</p>
<blockquote><p>No, this problem is a compiler/interpreter problem. </p></blockquote>
<p>The issue is not realy the compilers either they are acting on what is actually in the file, not what appears on the screen as seen by the human eye, because it&#8217;s actually the application that displays the file, that lies to the users eye.</p>
<p>So the real problem is stupidity, for not thinking such behaviour would not have undesirable side effects.</p>
<p>But the problem goes deeper, there has never yet been invented a &#8220;universal tool&#8221; that &#8220;can do every job&#8221;&#8230; The nearest we have to that when you think about it is a broken claw hammer&#8230;</p>
<p>And &#8220;broken&#8221; is the real issue. To try to make a tool that &#8220;can do every job&#8221; you have to break things, the only real question is,</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you want the breaks to be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then make them &#8220;hard breaks&#8221; where they can not hide or be used to hide other things.</p>
<p>That is &#8220;overt&#8221; not &#8220;covert&#8221; behaviour with &#8220;in band signaling&#8221;, anything else is asking for trouble&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s harder than it looks.</p>
<p>You are going to have to implement that override in the lowest level of the interpreter/compiler. The lexical analyzer is usually a finite state machine that tokenizes the sequences of characters in the input program into logical items.  Adding recognition of the Unicode Bi-Di state in addition to the language&#8217;s lexical state is complex.  I can see interactions when attackers start using homoglyphs for end-of-string-literal or end-of-comment. The lexical analyzer will now have a different view of the input state and may skip ahead. An attacker can use that to remove an input validation check.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t even say no bi-di text interleaved with non-bidi text, because it is perfectly reasonable to comment in Arabic or Hebrew while most of the program text is plain text.</p>
<p>The immediate response is a program source file with <em>any</em> Unicode control code should be flagged as &#8220;needs careful review. Then someone gets to write a scanner that looks for anomalies &#8211; the challenge is this has to be programming-language dependent.</p>

<p>This is correct.</p>
<p>This &#8216;feature&#8217; to accept UTF-8 in source code at the parser level, was a mistake, that added unneeded complexity.  And with unneeded complexity, the attack space increases.</p>
<p>All programmers, world wide, even if english was not their native language, knew enough english to read and write source code.  More importantly, how to read documentation.</p>
<p>No one needs UTF-8 to get machine code generated.</p>

				<p>@ Ted, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>Are any of these more or less effective?</p></blockquote>
<p>They are all good or bad depending on your view point under any of many different circumstances&#8230;</p>
<p>An editor for writing source code in, should not be hiding such things, some don&#8217;t (ed / vi / vim) but most other modern editors do which under most circumstances is bad.</p>
<p>Why modern code editors do this, I have no idea, after all it adds needless code by the bucket full, and as we should all know the number of vulnarabilities in code is approximately related to the number of lines, and worse is multiplied by needless complexity&#8230;</p>
<p>The design principle should not be to hide things from the user in a coders editor, because it&#8217;s asking for trouble&#8230;</p>
<p>The principle of &#8220;least surprise&#8221; is now well established and hiding things by the use of control charecters and other silent in band signalling is most definately very high on the surprise list&#8230;</p>
<p>As a temporary fix, making all source files &#8220;7bit clean&#8221; ASCII via a simple filter is probably the best thing to do, because it will fix the problem with minimal surprises.</p>
<p>In the long run &#8220;yes&#8221; we can fix the editors and other tools that hide what is actually in the source file.</p>
<p>But programmers have no need in by far the greatest number of cases to need anything other than 7bit clean ASCII by default. If they need to add &#8220;funnies&#8221; then they can put them in with escaped numeric or hex codes. But realy, they realy realy should not do even that&#8230; You should never embed presentation in the program logic. It&#8217;s the very reason the internationalization started in the first place. Programers should lift such stuff out and put it in tables in seperate files not the source code. Back in the 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s some lessons were learnt the hard way, yet now that all appears to have been forgoton.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Therefore, a better defense might be to ban the use of unterminated Bidi override characters within string literals and comments.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Is a bad idea for two simple reasons,</p>
<p>1, It still gives a hiding place &#8220;for no good reason&#8221;.<br />
2, It adds unnecessary complexity &#8220;for no good reason&#8221;.</p>
<p>Either is bad, but combined, they form the base of another disaster waiting to happen.</p>
<p>It would be better to say &#8220;no control characters&#8221; other than the basics&#8230; But as I&#8217;ve pointed out even ASCII control chars alow you to write backwards thus &#8220;over-strike&#8221;. Which with modern displays in reality means &#8220;hiding information&#8221;, thus does not follow the &#8220;least surprise&#8221; principle.</p>

				<p>&#8220;No one needs UTF-8 to get machine code generated.&#8221;<br />
I&#8217;m going to disagree, here. That&#8217;s because different OS have different default mappings, especially when they support multiple natural languages. ASCII-7, vs. CodePage-1252 vs. EBCDIC vs. ISO 8859-1. Moving code written with one character set to another character set, then compiling leads to problems. People don&#8217;t chenge their native code page when writing or editing code. Maybe they should, but I have to import whatever is out on GitHub and can&#8217;t enforce an authoring choice. Just shifting between Mac and Windows gives problems. So I convert to Unicode, THEN filter the characters. UTF-8 in the source file to get around 16-bit byte order problems.</p>

				<p>This is very old news. Back in the 80&#8217;s I have used a few control characters in a particular ZX Spectrum BASIC program to hide a conditional I sneaked into it, so it wasn&#8217;t visible when the program was displayed on the screen. The program, written by our teacher, was used to proctor physics tests. You can probably imagine what the conditional did. I told my classmates to use the feature sparingly, as not to raise suspicions. As far as I know, it persisted until the very end of the poor Speccy&#8217;s life. I am sure such tricks were used by many people before, on much older systems.</p>
<p>Introducing non-ASCII characters to a programming language parser, so you could call your temporary variable хуй, or use Sanskrit numerals, is just plain stupid. Every programmer has to know some English &#8211; the keywords are in English anyway (in the languages I know at least, unless you specifically alias them somehow). Moreover, using sensible English names not only makes your code readable for everyone &#8211; it also, for a non-native speaker at least, makes you stop and think more abstractively what the object is for and if it is needed at all.</p>
<p>Unicode text strings is a different thing. However avoiding text literals in he code shall be a common practice in inernationalized software &#8211; they should be placed somewhere else. Alas, there&#8217;s also debug code which virtually nobody cares about etc. which can be misused to hide something from plain view &#8211; but only if your editor is stupid enough.</p>

				<p>@Clive, Z.Lozinski</p>
<p>Thank you for replying to my question about defense strategies. I am doing my best to keep up with your impressive knowledge.</p>
<p>Based on your responses, I am wondering if I went the wrong direction with my question. I saw someone tweet an excerpt from the conclusion of the paper.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The fact that the Trojan Source vulnerability affects almost all computer languages makes it a rare opportunity for a system-wide and ecologically valid cross-platform and cross- vendor comparison of responses. As far as we are aware, it is<br />
  an unprecedented test of the coordinated disclosure ecosystem.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you think this is more about a system wide assessment than a particular vulnerability?</p>

I've been writing about security issues on my <a href="/">blog</a> since 2004, and in my monthly <a href="/crypto-gram/">newsletter</a> since 1998. I'm a fellow and lecturer at Harvard's <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/bruce-schneier">Kennedy School</a>, a board member of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and the Chief of Security Architecture at <a href="https://inrupt.com/">Inrupt, Inc.</a> This personal website expresses the opinions of none of those organizations.</p>
