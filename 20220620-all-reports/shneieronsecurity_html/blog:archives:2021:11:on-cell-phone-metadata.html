<p>Very interesting rebuttal from benny bryant.</p>
<p>benny included what looks like highlighted screenshots from court case filings. Are these out there and accurate?</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bennybryant17/status/1455133837848109058" rel="nofollow ugc">https://twitter.com/bennybryant17/status/1455133837848109058</a></p>
<p>benny also tweets:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  PSb/ they have not all been discovered solely by telecoms data<br />
  they&#8217;ve been discovered via Signal chat, GoToMeeting meetings, Facebook messages, bank records, phone records, email records&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Does cell phone metadata still take the lead on discovery? Also what is benny’s angle on disagreeing with Tomi Ahonen?</p>

<p>Having followed the proceedings primarily through @emptywheel at <a href="https://twitter.com/emptywheel" rel="nofollow ugc">https://twitter.com/emptywheel</a> and <a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.emptywheel.net/</a> , I believe @bennybryant17&#8217;s screenshots are accurate.  You can check them yourself at <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.courtlistener.com/</a> or, from a more authoritative source but one that you have to pay for, at <a href="https://pacer.uscourts.gov/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://pacer.uscourts.gov/</a></p>
<p>I think video evidence has taken the lead in discovery.  There are thousands of hours of video taken from security cameras inside and outside the Capitol as well as the intruders&#8217; own smartphones that they used to record their activities to upload or stream to social media.  The video evidence is primarily buttressed by financial info such as hotel and flight charges.  The cell phone meta data may have been used as a screen to tell investigators who to investigate, or to help identify false leads, and has been used in search warrants.  I&#8217;m not sure how much of it has been used in the actual indictments however, but it may have been in cases where the tower pings or GPS data strongly indicated a location directly in the interior of the Capitol.  Reading the indictments and unsealed search warrants would definitively answer that question tho.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think @bennybryant17 has an angle on this except to take umbrage to fake news and efforts at self promotion.</p>

				<p>@Ted,</p>
<p>PS, as @bennybryant17 also correctly points out, a lot of the investigation has made use of social media posts (facebook, parler and others) in which persons bragged about their activities on January 6, which was then traced back to the suspects using server IP logs, etc.  Indictments and plea agreements were also leveraged to expand the investigation by requiring suspects to identify with whom they communicated, traveled, and/or entered the Capitol, and to allow their phones and social media accounts to be searched.</p>

&#8220;Very interesting rebuttal from benny bryant.&#8221;</p>
<p>I particularly like the fictional account by Tomi Ahonen. He has worked at Nokia from before SMS was invented and through the whole mobile revolution. His job has always been to extract data for marketing from mobile networks. He has a good view on what mobile meta data is available and how it can be used.</p>

<blockquote><p>Network analysis is the most effective discovery method I know short of telepathy.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s other people way on the case more than I am (like 1000%) or spotting something ages before I wombled in to things. I&#8217;ve seen some of the network analysis (by a person with a job title in this area) and it made my eyes pop.</p>
<p>I have zero idea what intelligence agencies or law enforcement do with this stuff. Cops by and large are utterly dumb and have their own issues as we&#8217;ve been hearing about recently but then the cops are what they are so there&#8217;sonly so much you can expect. The current UK government is half the problem so not much noise from them. I find their centralisation of power, secrecy, and use of behavorial psychology very suspect on top of everything else.</p>
<p>Two things just dropped in my lap today. The BBC (and Guardian) has some real problems. Mismanagement is one thing then there is the lying by management. There&#8217;s a traffic analysis angle here but also how you interpret this. It&#8217;s not so much what&#8217;s in the media but what they&#8217;re keeping out of the media.</p>

<p>Follow the thread from the picture of Motel6. Then you get a picture of Tomi (with hat) in front of the Arby&#8217;s in Penna. 😉</p>
<p>However, this story is what they teach in security kindergarten. It is just that the foot pawns and front people are generally really, really &#8220;underqualified&#8221;</p>
<p>PS: It is no secret that Tomi loves America but does not like Trump et al. (which is an understatement).</p>

				<p>Note also some frightening assumptions such as &#8220;Means he was AWARE of his guilt&#8221;. So, turning off your tracking device (your smartphone) now makes you a suspect.</p>

&#8220;Note also some frightening assumptions such as “Means he was AWARE of his guilt”. &#8221;</p>
<p>That is quite normal. If you argue there was no premeditation, then anything that indicates you took precautions or preparations is relevant.</p>

<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t find the picture, darn it. But I still need your help. I’m hoping you can explain to me why Tomi would use misinformation (it is misinformation right?) to inform his 116k twitter followers about the exact nature of the surveillance and particularly the phone surveillance used to ID the conspirators when there is SOO much astounding legitimate information.</p>
<p>@Alan had some awesome info. I couldn’t find the exact documents that benny bryant screenshott’d in his tweets, but I found a related one searching for Case 1:21-cr-00028-APM.</p>
<p>I guess I don’t understand if Tomi is trying to be humorous or be a part of the action? Or is he trying to spread general, even if it’s wrong or incomplete, info?</p>
<p>Reading the case document about the conspirators is horrifying and entertaining at the same time. It gives more details about some of their activity, but due to time constraints on my end I don’t know how it aligns with Tomi’s twitter thread.</p>
<p>These people remind me of my cousins, if my cousins were 8 and bat 5h*t crazy.</p>

&#8220;I’m hoping you can explain to me why Tomi would use misinformation (it is misinformation right?) to inform his 116k twitter followers about the exact nature of the surveillance and particularly the phone surveillance used to ID the conspirators when there is SOO much astounding legitimate information.&#8221;</p>
<p>What you will see in the news media will be the clear evidence. But that does not tell you how the FBI found/will find the suspects in the first place. Tomi&#8217;s account tells us how they could have done it using public information about the technology and the FBI.</p>
<p>Tomi writes:<br />
&#8220;I have no intention to give a &#8216;how to commit a perfect crime&#8217; guide-book on finer details of my industry. I will keep this broad, but everything in this Thread is 100% true. FBI went into FAR more detail than this fictional &#8216;episode of The Wire'&#8221;</p>
<p>ht-tps://mobile.twitter.com/tomiahonen/status/1453798439893012485</p>
<p>Tomi also makes it clear in every tweet that this is fictional: He calls it &#8220;The Wire: Trump Special Thread&#8221;. As you might know, The Wire was a fictional series.</p>

				<p>@ Stéphane Bortzmeyer,</p>
<blockquote><p>So, turning off your tracking device (your smartphone) now makes you a suspect.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is the modern version of &#8220;behaving suspiciously&#8221;.</p>
<p>Anyone who plans to do something has two problems with regards the planed scene to be,</p>
<p>1, Explaining they were not there.<br />
2, Explaining where they were.</p>
<p>Those with sufficient resources solve both be getting another party to carry out the plan.</p>
<p>They then just behave normally, or make the plan coincide with some public function they attend and have many independent witnesses. Their only problem is ensuring they are noticed and remembered which is not that hard when you think about it.</p>
<p>Others used to &#8220;loan&#8221; a friend who looks similar to them their credit card, mobile phone, etc so they go out for the night and spend on the cards in various places maybe send a few texts fron there etc (but not take or make voice calls). The friend being wise enough to be careful to avoid CCTV. Obviously this is getting more difficult due to the increase not just of CCTV but the miniaturization and hiding of high resolution cameras that make facial recognition and other ML systems to identify people etc a breeze&#8230;</p>
<p>Streetwise kids in London go out in groups and swap not just phones, but travel cards, and as they go along clothes and back packs etc they also &#8220;mill&#8221; amongst themselves making tracking hard. That is they create so much noise in the CCTV footage that it&#8217;s never going to be believable in court, and almost anyone can say they were &#8220;in the group&#8221;.</p>
<p>So what does someone planing to do something do to not be where they are carrying it out.</p>
<p>Well the first is to &#8220;run silent&#8221; that is no phone use only cash have clothes etc in a bag they can use to change their appearence several times. Unfortunately CCTV is to numerous and &#8220;body build&#8221; and &#8220;gait&#8221; are very very hard to disguise.</p>
<p>A second option is &#8220;run under false flag&#8221;. Which is to appear as an identifiable individual using their phone, cards, clothes etc. This is a highly risky strategy for a whole variety of reasons, but it can be done.</p>
<p>One variation that is almost in the realms of fantasy is for you to &#8220;set someone up&#8221; to be the prime suspect. That is  in effect you carefully get travel cards, burner phone etc and associate them with the target in various ways prior to the planed action. You then at the planed place ensure that there is &#8220;contact&#8221; / &#8220;trace&#8221; of the objects, and likewise contact evidence of the place on the objects. Having carried out the plan you then arange for the objects to be found at a place such as the targets home in a way that looks like there was an effort to destroy them that failed. Whilst it is a near fantasy for people making plans, a variation of it most definately not. That is &#8220;fitting up&#8221;  suspects that certain UK police forces have been caught doing over the years to &#8220;get results&#8221;.</p>
<p>But that still leaves the problem of being somewhere else and this is actually quite hard to do convincingly. Just leaving your phone at home or turning it off is not going to work.</p>
<p>The reason &#8220;humans are creatures of habit&#8221;. Unless you plan otherwise for quite some time before hand the change in your behaviour will show up in cell phone records etc, like a shining beacon.</p>
<p>So you have to do two things as a minimum,</p>
<p>1, Change your habits a long time in advance (ie six months or more).<br />
2, Have a believable and verifiable reason to have changed your habits.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is not to have a plan and then have to change habits, just change your habits now bit by vit. That is say tommorow you become just a little eratic in how you use your phone, and over time become more erratic or make changes for shopping and going out that gives you &#8220;me time&#8221; or &#8220;windows of opportunity&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>That is if you plan to go out for the evening with the girls/guys, turn your phone off the night before when you go to bed, putting it on charge. Then only turn it on when you say get to work in the morning. Over time you make the night before put on charge or turn off earlier and earlier then you have a believable window. Sometimes just turn it off before you leave work. If anyone asks why &#8220;saving the battery for night out&#8221; helps establish patterns in other peoples heads as well as cell records. Bit by bit you build up space or &#8220;windows of opportunity&#8221; that you can, if you later need to plan something use to your advantage. Likewise if something unexpected happens the fact that your phone was off when it&#8217;s most likely to happen gives you space.</p>
<p>There are several other things you can do, but the point is &#8220;habits are a strong signal&#8221;. Much worse if you &#8220;break habits they are as strong a signal&#8221; of &#8220;difference&#8221; thus circumstantial evidence that can be easily made to look like &#8220;guilt&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have &#8220;habits&#8221; then all you make is &#8220;noise&#8221; which makes the circumstantial evidence harder but still arguable by a prosecutor. The real trick is to have weak habits that work in your favour that way you have counter argument to assumptions of guilt.</p>
<p>People get taught such techniques as part of basic &#8220;field craft&#8221; courses so that if they have to meet a handler or visit a drop box etc there is not a visable pattern in what they do that correlates such meetings etc.</p>
<p>Aside from people &#8220;flapping their gums&#8221; which gets police well over 80% of their suspects, t&#8217;s all about &#8220;finding,patterns&#8221;. Not just in your activities but in other peoples activities that coincide or correlate over time. In communications we talk about &#8220;Traffic Analysis&#8221; in other activities they talk about &#8220;contact networks&#8221; and similar. In all cases they are looking for patterns and correlation. These are getting the &#8220;trickle down&#8221; effect and moving out from intelligence agencies into law enforcment agencies, as well as private contractors / consultants working for large corporates etc.</p>
<p>In all cases the investigators MO is get a list of potential suspects as a starting point, droping those who have credible alibies etc, till there are just a few &#8220;likely suspects&#8221; then the game changes the investigators stop looking to eliminate suspects, but find indicators of guilt. But at all points of an investigation individuals are automatically assumed guilty untill proven not guilty in one way or another. Circumstantial evidence almost never makes you &#8220;not guilty&#8221; but it very often does make people &#8220;guilty&#8221;.</p>
<p>That is in the eyes of investigators, circumstantial evidence is just &#8220;random&#8221; / &#8220;chance&#8221; when it might clear you. But &#8220;probative&#8221; / &#8220;probable&#8221; when it might make you guilty. This is a cognative bias at work, and nearly all investigators have it. Because they are almost always &#8220;results driven&#8221; and a &#8220;result&#8221; is &#8220;finding someone guilty&#8221; as far as they are concerned &#8220;anyone will do&#8221; even if the happen to be innocent. Because &#8220;results matter, justice is irrelevant&#8221;, &#8220;case closed move on&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the sound advice is &#8220;Never ever speak to investigators even if you are innocent&#8221; there is absolutly no benifit in it for you, and potentially significant harm. Even telling the truth can make you look guilty. You say you were on a bus, they won&#8217;t try at all hard to find witnesses, it&#8217;s a lot of pointless work for them because you&#8217;re guilty anyway&#8230; They are more likely to try and find some one who thinks they saw someone vaguely like you, and warp their memory. That way in court the prosecution claim there was no evidence your story was true, but a witness very definately places you at the scene. That takes a jury just about long enough to have a cup of coffee to find you guilty&#8230;</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve read where many of the domestic terrorists were using cheap FRS phones. Most terrorist teams probably wouldn&#8217;t stray far from each other, I agree. There is safety in numbers.</p>
<p>I think only rubes would continue to use cell phones in the 21st Century, in order to plan and blow-up the country, thus making the way for the Haitians and Hondurans to empty the Treasury.</p>

<p>Nice read. Note how the origal thread of bennybryant17 criticized Toni&#8217;s story along the lines that the perpetrators were not able to keep up the opsec they should have.</p>
<p>This coup failed because the insurrection was executed by people who were as hopelessly incompetent as their boss.</p>

<p>Their poor opsec made no difference in the success or failure of the coup attempt. Their poor opsec was only discovered and used against them after the coup failed.  Hopefully next time, if there is a next time, they will be discovered and the coup attempt thwarted before it even gets started.</p>

				<p>@ Alan,</p>
<p>If you read @bennybryant17, it&#8217;s clear his &#8220;core competence&#8221; is not cellular phones.</p>
<p>Because he missed something quite important.</p>
<p>If you read @tomiahonen thread in tweet /8 you find,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;There is a process called triangulation, by which the network knows roughly where you are, <b>accuracy of about one city block</b>&#8220;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Is realy not true for a whole host of reasons, not least of which is what counts as a city block anyway?</p>
<p>Very roughly in the US it&#8217;s an area 1/16th of a mile by 1/8th of a mile. This is not a shape that fits snugly into either a circle or the more traditional triangulation &#8220;cocked hat&#8221; triangle.</p>
<p>Yes I know some people informaly use a &#8220;block&#8221; as a measure of distance by saying &#8220;Oh it&#8217;s about five blocks from here&#8221; but again it has no meaning when talking about radient signals eminating from a point.</p>
<p>But there are other issues, triangulation by cell tower is not done by measuring angles, but by measuring &#8220;time delay&#8221; in theoryvas with GPS it could be very accurate&#8230;</p>
<p>In practice it&#8217;s not. If you are in a totaly open space and can see all three cell site masts then yes you get the best accuracy but it&#8217;s not that good. However the minute you can not see a cell site mast, there are two big issues that arise,</p>
<p>1, Multipath<br />
2, Reflection increased path length.</p>
<p>Without going into details both can very significantly effect the times used to calculate distance thus position.</p>
<p>Anyone who has worked in the mobile phone industry should be able to tell you why they perform considerable surveys, and it&#8217;s not just to check to see if all streets get coverage.</p>
<p>Firstly even in a perfectly open environment the accuracy of the location varies with time delay from the mast. So you end up with a variable degree of accuracy. In effect you have a circle around each of the sites representing time delay. Where the three circles cross is aproximately where the mobile will be in theory&#8230; Each circle has a width so you end up with a very funny shape sort of triangle, called for historic reasons a &#8220;cocked hat&#8221; there four there are four places the mobile &#8220;might&#8221; be in. The first is inside the triangle, the other three are outside the triangle aproximately bounded by a distance equivalent to the point of the triangle furthest away from the side. In practice it&#8217;s quite a lot more uncertain.</p>
<p>If the mobile signal is blocked by a building from the direct path to a cell tower, then the signal will arive via one or more reflections that are of unknown extra time delay. This has the effect of moving that sites time circle to have a larger radius which can be quite significant. Thus the cocked hat will not just enlarge the cocked hat significantly it will have a high degree of uncertainty related to the number of reflections (think RMS).</p>
<p>Another side effect of reflections is as a mobile moves at a constant rate along a straight path, the position reported by the time delays &#8220;jumps&#8221; and if you just overlaid on a map you might well appear to jump several streets away in just a few seconds. In fact you could end up appearing to junp back and forth like a flea on a hot griddle, at very very unlikely speeds&#8230;</p>
<p>So where are you?</p>
<p>Are you at one end of the jump or the other or some point in between. The answer is &#8220;Err&#8221; that is it is unknown you are in effect in any or all of those places so you are in an elipse or lozenge shaped area with no real way of determining, because it does not matter what method you use to average, the only thing you will have any degree of certainty on is &#8220;It&#8217;s most likely wrong&#8221;.</p>
<p>Even 5G with it&#8217;s fancy beam stearing is not going to realy improve on things, in fact it could easily be a whole lot worse&#8230;</p>
<p>The point is these PlonkerBoys et al are very probaly not that bright, their alledged leaders certainly are not. They probably don&#8217;t have the levels of confidence a well trained infantry squad would have. Theirfore they are likely to either stay in eyesight of the leader or directly adjacent to an easily recognised land mark. Most probably they would stay quite close if not very close to each other. Which would have the net effect as far as cell tower triangulation of putting them in the same place.</p>
<p>Therefor I suspect as there was a lot of CCTV around and the idiots dressed in recognisable ways, the FBI would probably use CCTV footage rather than cell tower triangulation.</p>
<p>Thus I would say that @tomiahonen is putting way to much butter on his bread and hoping to get as much jam. Or if you prefere a more rural expression his story &#8220;ain&#8217;t worth the price of a pile of horse apples&#8221;.</p>
<p>P.S. People should realise that most people who work for cell manufacturers or mobile service providers are not at all technical in fact they tend to be sales / marketing / admin / janitorial etc. The number of people who are actually involved with the design of mobile phones, again only a very small number will have technical expertise on the radio side. If memory serves, from an interview he gave to a podcast in the entirety of Nokia they only had one person doing the RF design work around the antenna&#8230;</p>
<p>When I worked in a similar environment the &#8220;electronics&#8221; engineers were few and only three had RF design capability and most of the time &#8211;more than 90%&#8211; they did not do RF work but all the other bits including mechanical design. In other organisations I worked in RF design was done by the &#8220;device manufacturer&#8221; as &#8220;App Notes&#8221; that just got copied. In fact there is only one company I worked for outside of the &#8220;Defence Industry&#8221; where true RF design and inovation was done. I was one and worked &#8220;contract&#8221; not &#8220;permi&#8221; the other was one of the owners of the company and he and I had gone to school together. Sadly he died accidentally a little over a year ago. The last project we worked on was a light weight low cost UV-C anti-viral personal breathing apparatus for doctors and nurses. We had developed a prototype but due to his death it all stopped.</p>

				<p>@Clive</p>
<p>You are 100% correct and some of the search warrants I read gave way too much credence to the accuracy of the cell phone location data.  Some of that location data may have been based on phone&#8217;s GPS location data, which is more accurate but still not that accurate.  See also this article and the associated FBI document that Bruce blogged about a few days ago:<br />
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/10/how-the-fbi-gets-location-information.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/10/how-the-fbi-gets-location-information.html</a></p>
<p>As I mentioned however, I don&#8217;t believe the phone location data was used except as a prescreen when trying to narrow down suspects and identify them based on video and other evidence.  An actual review of the search warrants and indictments should show this.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the answer.  If you make the assumption that a cell phone is a person, and no one goes anywhere without one, the above youtube video link show tracking individuals via cell tower data.</p>
<p>I bet you  could identify and track a pickpocket during Mardi Gras if you knew the IMEIs of some of the victims.</p>
<p>This is why I put a phone cradle on my Roomba so that my phone moves randomly around the house all of the time</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve just read someone reporting the far right material I mentioned up thread contains threats against the current US President. I will leave it to others to join the dots with the insurrection referenced in the topic. People have reported this material to the appropriate authorites including the Secret Service. Direct threats have also been made against some very well loved people with an international public profile. As for whether prosecutions follow is another topic as is prosecutions against whom because the source of this far right material is low hanging fruit and just one data point in a cloud of data points.</p>
<p>Ordinary people can be frustrated and say daft things which is why on one occasion I warned someone to delete a comment along these lines. I know they were joking but the fact is by law the US Security Service is required to investigate all threats. Whether they picked this up or went beyond toggling a key on their keyboard for &#8220;idiot mouthing off but not a threat&#8221; I have no idea but I also said they would not want to put future legitimate and lawful international travel at risk. But threats can also be very very fluffy and indirect much like the modern far right media friendly types indulge in. They&#8217;re not so much making threats but nurturing and inflaming and directing anger. Behind the luxury yachts and gift of the gab the people pulling the trigger retain their empires and wealth and status and are walking free. For now?</p>
