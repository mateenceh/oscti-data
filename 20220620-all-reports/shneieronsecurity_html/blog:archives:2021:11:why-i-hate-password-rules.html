		<h2 class="entry">Why I Hate Password Rules</h2>
		<p>The other day I was creating a new account on the web. It was financial in nature, which means it gets one of my most secure passwords. I used <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/passsafe/">PasswordSafe</a> to generate this 16-character alphanumeric password:</p>
<pre><code>:s^Twd.J;3hzg=Q~
</code></pre>
<p>Which was rejected by the site, because it didn&#8217;t meet their password security rules.</p>
<p>It took me a minute to figure out what was wrong with it. They wanted at least two numbers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secure_1.html">Sheesh</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, that&#8217;s not really why I don&#8217;t like password rules. I don&#8217;t like them because they&#8217;re all different. If someone has a strong password generation system, it is likely that whatever they come up with won&#8217;t pass somebody&#8217;s ruleset.</p>

				<p>Aren&#8217;t long passwords better than short ones (<a href="https://xkcd.com/936/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://xkcd.com/936/</a>)?</p>
<p>I usually use</p>
<p>pwgen -ync 40</p>
<p>to create password. But there&#8217;s quite a few sites/services that don&#8217;t want such long passwords or reject special chars.</p>

				<p>It would be nice if all password managers would standardize password generation options. Then the website could say: please instruct your password manager to use option x,y,z to generate the password &#8211; and that is it.<br />
It may also boost usage of password managers and strong passwords.</p>

				<p>Fortunately, PasswordSafe allows you to specify custom password rules if needed. Especially idiotic are custom sets of special characters for a website. Fortunately some tell you what they allow and you can copy the set into the custom rule.</p>
<p>I agree wholeheartedly that custom password rules are a nuisance, as well as the requirement to change the password at regular intervals.</p>

				<p>@ Bruce, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>If someone has a strong password generation system, it is likely that whatever they come up with won’t pass somebody’s ruleset.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whilst true and expected, it is actually also desirable that it should be so.</p>
<p>If you invert the argument you get,</p>
<p>&#8220;All password rules should be the same&#8221;</p>
<p>Is perilously close to,</p>
<p>&#8220;All eggs in one basket&#8221;</p>
<p>Failings, or as others might put it,</p>
<p>&#8220;Lacks hybid vigour&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s important.</p>
<p>As I and others have been discussing[1] there is a great deal of importance in,</p>
<p>“It you build something and it works you learn nothing you did not know already, if it fails and you fix it you learn something new, success is built on failure not success.”</p>
<p>So logically a multiplicity of rule sets gives us,</p>
<p>1, Hybrid vigour.<br />
2, Oportunities to learn.</p>
<p>Both are desirable.</p>

				<p>Oh wow! I just tried to generate a password in PasswordSafe and the first one gave me at least 2 numbers. I won&#8217;t disclose it here, because it is my first test and it is in use.</p>
<p>But here is another example: Lj]B*U7dm)P1</p>
<p>Further tests show that the default password generation policy doesn&#8217;t necessarily have a rule for a minimum of two numbers. But then I realized you could change the policy settings in the generator to give more numeric digits and check this out: 04(882SRj=B7</p>
<p>Oh my yay! Fun, fun, fun! &#x263A;</p>

				<p>@ ALL,</p>
<p>With regards password managers on various devices, there is a conversation over on the Friday Squid about reasons to use or not use one and why,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/11/securing-your-smartphone.html/#comment-393432" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/11/securing-your-smartphone.html/#comment-393432</a></p>
<p>So not one but to cases of synchronicity in one place at the same time&#8230;</p>
<p>Does that mean &#8220;Enemy action&#8221;?</p>

				<p>Passwords will never go away.</p>
<p>NIST should sponsor a contest to develop better password complexity scoring algorithms the same as they do for cryptographic standards.</p>

				<p>The variations on &#8220;which special characters are okay&#8221; is annoying, but I guess <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/" rel="nofollow ugc">Little Bobby Tables</a>, AKA Robert&#8217;); DROP TABLE STUDENTS ;&#8211; might be to blame.</p>
<p>No, what bugs me is the pages that won&#8217;t let you copy/paste from your password manager to the password box, PLUS lookalike characters if you forget to check the &#8216;avoid similar-looking characters&#8217; box when generating the password.</p>
<p>0O001l11l0O1</p>
<p>Which is <em>FINE</em> if you see it in a decent font, but not all webpages do that.</p>

				<p>The NIST has already advised on passwords, and issued guidelines a couple of years ago &#8212; recommending LESS COMPLEX passwords (no rules) in favor of longer passwords.<br />
They cite research indicating that complex passwords are not harder to crack, and are much harder to remember (which is why people write them down, or now use password managers).  Longer passwords, on the other hand, can be easy to remember as phrases or strings of words, etc.  Longer passwords are harder to crack.</p>

				<p>The reason I hate everyone&#8217;s password complexity requirements is because practically no one tells you what they are until you haven&#8217;t met them!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve found that most financial sites have very short limits on password lengths and often get confused by any punctuation.  It seems they may be passing the input directly to their 20 yr old MVS system or they only want to support passwords someone with a touch phone can enter?</p>
<p>In my head, I know that a completely random, 15 character password should be fine, but something tells me that a 33, 44, 55, 66 completely random character password is better.<br />
It isn&#8217;t like I&#8217;ll ever remember these or ever actually type them in, so if I must have a password at all, why not allow 15-4K as the length boundaries and disable complexity mandates after 30 characters?</p>
<p>Hopefully, everyone here is using a password manager, perhaps a U2F token for 2FA. My bank sent out a branded RSA key when I ask years ago for free, but they have never made it mandatory to use, if you have one. That seems foolish to me. Allowing people to use less secure methods should only be allowed if they call in and speak with a bank employee trained on anti-phishing conversations.</p>
<p>Remember at one bank, they asked me for a few answers to the security questions when I called them to report a login failure bug.  Seems she could see those.  I always use random answers for all their &#8220;security questions&#8221; &#8230; and told her that.  She was convinced I was me when I said the last 4 characters for my dog&#8217;s name was $9rP and it was about 30 random characters.</p>
<p>The entire &#8220;site image&#8221; stuff is a joke.</p>

				</p>

				<p>My personal way to accommodate the rules is:<br />
&#8211; create a long secure password with letters only<br />
  ex: lqpkdfanptnolofhtji<br />
&#8211; Add the requested constrains:<br />
  ex: lqpkdfanptnolofhtji.1A</p>
<p>The security of the final password is the security of the initial one (20 alphabetical characters should be fine).</p>
<p>The only problem is when the constrain is to make the password shorter. If the length limit is 12 characters, my final password has the secirity of only 9 alphabetical characters.</p>

				<p>@Scott Raun: Or tell you what they are, but in vague terms.  &#8220;One or more special characters like ! @ #&#8221; and then reject things like &#8216;&lt;&#039; or &#039;;&#039;.  Even better is the login page I saw that listed the section sign (U+00A7, §) among the examples of acceptable symbols.  Right, like I&#039;m going to trust that your coders can stick to a consistent codepage or Unicode normalization.</p>
<p>And then there are the sites which silently mangle passwords on the password change form, but <em>don&#039;t</em> apply the same mangling rules on the login page.</p>

				<p>NIST has published guidelines on what types of passwords should be accepted for login systems. We should promote and share solutions to the problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html</a></p>
<p>Specifically the relevant recommendation here is: Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., requiring mixtures of different character types or prohibiting consecutively repeated characters) for memorized secrets.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been befuddled before by a financial website when it rejected my password which was auto generated from a password manager. First, my password was to long; seemed their limit was 10 digits. Second it wasn&#8217;t that they didn&#8217;t want special characters, it was that they only wanted one special character. Then I had to make sure my digit was not at the beginning of the password. After I finally made a successfully adjusted password and logged in&#8230; I wrote the bank customer service and righteously gave them hell for actually making password security weaker with such nonsense. I no longer have to deal with the site but they are now at least incorporating two factor authentication; wondering if I got through to them or they had a security breach.</p>

				<p>@jason  Re: XKCD scheme</p>
<p>Although longer passwords are better than shorter passwords, if you click through on the &#8220;Sheesh&#8221; link that Bruce provided, that resolves to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secure_1.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secure_1.html</a> . In that article, he explicitly notes:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why the oft-cited XKCD scheme for generating passwords — string together individual words like “correcthorsebatterystaple” — is no longer good advice. The password crackers are on to this trick.&#8221;</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t try to expand further on Bruce&#8217;s excellent explanation (and good follow-up comments), but it is noteworthy that that post was made in March of 2014 .</p>

<p>Usability has a huge impact on how people interact with systems.  If you purposely make the experiance different from site to site &#8211; users will take shortcuts including making weaker passwords.  A common &#8220;password standard&#8221; would benefit everyone greatly and reduce risk over all.</p>

				<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t necessarily mind the differing rulesets for passwords across different sites. What really annoys me are those sites that don&#8217;t provide the full ruleset, and also don&#8217;t correctly check the provided password against the mystery ruleset, which then allows the password creation/change but then doesn&#8217;t accept the password upon login. This tends to happen mainly with backslashes, not sure why.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m personally a fan of Apple&#8217;s Keychain password generator. You&#8217;re guaranteed 1 uppercase, 1 digit, 1 nonalphanumeric, and the rest lowercase. The security margin is about 72 bits.</p>
<p>Granted, this wouldn&#8217;t meet Bruce&#8217;s bank&#8217;s requirements in that they need 2 digits, but in most cases, this never fails.</p>

				<p>@ Tim,</p>
<blockquote><p>Usability has a huge impact on how people interact with systems.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>sad shake of head</i></p>
<p>Then why after the biblical lifetime are we still using a system that we have known from day one is broken?</p>
<p>Seventy years ago when people first started thinking about passwords for computer security, computer resources were so expensive in terms of storage that passwords made sense. Also the only human interface other than switches and light bulbs were old fashioned teleprinters going back fourty or fifty years before then.</p>
<p>We have kind of moved on, bio-metrics has come and more or less been found to be wanting in much the same way four digit PINs are.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve even tried moving the PIN onto a token that produces a TAN or equivalent.</p>
<p>The simple fact is user authentication sucks, either it is insecure or not fit for purpose.</p>
<p>Arguably passwords need to be up in the 100-200bit equivalent, the human mind can do maybe 24bits of random digits and depending on who you talk to less with random alphas.</p>
<p>So we try using words from a list which have betwen 8 and 12 bits depending on the list size, but again only as random, humans will try to rearange the word order to make it more memeroble, then depending on other measures those words could be as few as 4bits each.</p>
<p>Pass phrases tend to get selected from common sources such as songs, poems, dialog and have as little as 2bit per word&#8230;</p>
<p>So you are back to a random password for security&#8230;</p>
<p>Passwords that have any kind of human determination in them are weak, a lot weaker than people think, and length realy has little to do with it.</p>
<p>To see why, guess the last two letters of,</p>
<p>&#8220;TheCatSatOnTheM&#8221;</p>
<p>Or,</p>
<p>&#8220;L1v3L0ngAndPr0sp&#8221;</p>
<p>Or a whole bunch more.</p>

				<p>Many years ago, my bank &#8211; a major US financial institution &#8211; wouldn&#8217;t accept account passwords with characters other than [a-zA-Z0-9] or longer than 8 characters.</p>
<p>Their help pages mentioned &#8220;WILL1AM&#8221; as an example of a good password. Certainly no evil haxxor could figure out such clever spelling tricks! I am not making this up.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, things are mostly sane these days, and most sites will accept a secure password.</p>
<p>There is still the idiocy of disabling paste in password fields &#8211; who came up with that?? why?!? &#8211; but it seems to be falling out of favor, too, and a short snippet of javascript, stored as a bookmark, fixes the problem. There&#8217;s also a browser plugin for that IIRC.</p>

				<p>In addition to poorly defined password rules (given only after you&#8217;ve had one rejected), another poor practice is to require user names to be something common, often an email address. This makes it easy for hackers to target many of a person&#8217;s accounts, since breaking one usually leads to a cascade of other broken accounts. I prefer to generate user names using a random string generator like the one in PasswordSafe.</p>
<p>Oh yes &#8211; every password rule makes it easier to crack the password, by decreasing the possible entropy of the allowed choices. Other than reasonable hardware limits, there should be no rules.</p>

				<p>Still better than many banks that either truncate the password to only 6 or 8 characters or drop out all special characters.</p>
<p>I tested this on a small credit union and could put anything or nothing after the first six characters and it still authenticated.  On another city government payment portal if you left out the special characters from your password it still would authenticate.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it was a legacy unix setting to conserve storage or cup processing hash but still shocked it was still this way.</p>
<p>The bank responded and after a while it had been increased (not sure how many characters) but the government office never replied.</p>

				<p>@clive, you make good points, but don&#8217;t let them be dragged down by poor ones.  in the case of &#8220;TheCatSatOnTheM&#8221; and &#8220;L1v3L0ngAndPr0sp&#8221; while a human can easily finish those, a computer can&#8217;t.  plus (as we all know) when cracking a password it&#8217;s all or nothing, not like in the movies where it gets decrypted one character at a time and the cracker could help by finishing the job manually.<br />
but the latter password has decent entropy and would actually be pretty good&#8211;if it weren&#8217;t just dictionary words with standard substitutions.</p>

				<p>What annoys me the most is the length limitation. I like to use KeePass to store my passwords, and I like to use random.org to generate passwords, then mix them, and I wrote a python script that adds a random amount of UTF-8 asian + various characters at random so I get a very long and secure password.</p>
<p>They are so long and complex that I don&#8217;t even try to type them.</p>
<p>First problem I meet : websites that limit passwords to X characters. Sometimes with values as low as 8.</p>
<p>Second problem : websites that will let you enter a 64-character long passwords, but only record the first N chars from it. So when you come back next time, you paste the password and it doesn&#8217;t work and you have to guess how much you have to paste to enter, while avoiding an account lock.</p>
<p>Third problem : websites that are so badly programmed they can&#8217;t even apply their own rules. I have this at work currently : they want a password with numbers, lower case and upper case and symbols. I create a password that has several numbers, several upper, several lower, and several symbols and it FAILS to be accepted. This, being a developer myself, drives me absolutely nuts. Because they can&#8217;t even make a Regexp properly. And when you put your hand on the person that wrote that crap and see the code, they did not even use a Regexp but a series of .contains().</p>
<p>Passwords should be something like 128 or 256-chars wide. Full UTF-8 including any langage : egyptian glyphs, asian-langages symbols, old tongues from previous millenia. Perhaps a standard needs to be pushed for 256-char full UTF-8 range + a generator based on proper random source to generate such very-strong passwords. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Passwords might not be the future, but those limited to 8-chars are surely not.</p>

&#8220;but the latter password has decent entropy and would actually be pretty good–if it weren’t just dictionary words with standard substitutions&#8221;</p>
<p>Not really. As you already mention, 1337 5p34k is a very simple substitution cipher. And any combination of characters found by Google search has a theoretical strength in the order of ~70 bits (very optimistic).</p>
<p>Any type of order, or trick, in your passphrase makes it predictable to a smaller, or more likely, larger extend. You lose password strength much faster than you think, whatever you think.</p>
<p>What helps a little is to increase the length. Many password crackers cannot handle very long strings well and will run out of memory. They will find a solution to this, eventually.</p>

				<p>It seems this could be mitigated quite a bit for websites, if there was another HTML INPUT tag attribute for the password input that describe the password rules, in such a way that a password generator could use it. If a browser could also parse it into human language, that would make it even better. It there were a set of standardized pre-defined rules, that could make this easier.</p>

				<p>My favorite are ones where there&#8217;s a maximum length, implying they don&#8217;t even hash the password and store it in a varchar(x) db column</p>

				<p>I agree that the worst &#8220;rule&#8221; is on password length.</p>
<p>Not only because it limits entropy, but because it implies that the backend storage is just plopping the password into a database, no hash, so salt and no pepper.</p>

				<p>I use pass, the standard unix password manager.</p>
<p>pass generate sitename.com</p>
<p>usually passes the test on the first try  (20 characters by default) though sometimes I have to pass the -n flag to disable special characters. Sometimes the site requires at least one special characters but you cannot include some special characters. At this point I usually give up.</p>

				<p>@ Laurent,</p>
<blockquote><p>Add the requested constrains: ex: lqpkdfanptnolofhtji.1A</p></blockquote>
<p>Has the advantage that you can use a simple rule for adding the constraints that would be easy to memorize, so not have to be stored with the actual password.</p>
<p>Thus gives you a little extra protection should your Password Manager contents become known to an adversary.</p>
<p>@ ALL,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a point that many miss, but a true random paswword concatonated or interleaved in some way with a site specific prefix, suffix or both that is far from random, and is easy to remember or work out means that you only store away incomplete passwords that are not of use to an attacker unless they have seen you type in a suffix etc AND can work out what the pattern/rule is you use.</p>
<p>They have to get the whole password right within three or for tries on a live system or grind through one heck of a lot of combinations on a password cracking system.</p>
<p>It not only strengthans your password, it also gives you a measure of extra protection should your password manager contents become known to an adversary.</p>
<p>However do remember that those random passwords do have to be different for every site otherwise you are in effect doing the equivalent of &#8220;reusing a OTP&#8221; thus alowing an easy attack in depth.</p>

				<p>Sites disallowing some special characters is the worst. &#8220;It&#8217;s gonna lead to SQLi or OS injection&#8221;. Well, what the heck are you doing with my password. It should go from request.POST(&#8220;password&#8221;) to scrypt (or something) to your database and not be used in cleartext anywhere.</p>
<p>To verify, scrypt.verify( request.POST(&#8220;password&#8221;), value_from_the_database )</p>
<p>So to be clear, where is request.POST(&#8220;password&#8221;) being used <strong><em>IN_ANY_CONXEXT</em></strong> other than the storage or verification of my password?</p>
<p>Look at the rules for an AWS password. They are insane.</p>

<p>There is actually some logic to that. The idea is to keep the password out of the cut and paste buffer, where it could possibly be exfiltrated, or accidently pasted later into another formbox.</p>

				<p>@ Iain,</p>
<blockquote><p>What really annoys me are those sites that don’t provide the full ruleset, and also don’t correctly check the provided password against the mystery ruleset,</p></blockquote>
<p>The ones that &#8220;rattle my bars&#8221; as it were are the backend systems having one set of rules, but the front end web interface having a different set of rules.</p>
<p>So the backend system say only alows 8chars but the web interface alows more say 12chars in some frames but only 10 or 8 in others&#8230;</p>
<p>Where it goes horribly wrong is when it comes to changing passwords where the backend system wants you type them in twice, but the front end designer fails to handle it properly or worse trys to be cleaver by &#8220;comparing two web form entries&#8221; on the web interface rather than send it to the backend service &#8220;as is&#8221;&#8230;</p>

				<p>@ Jamesz,</p>
<blockquote><p>in the case of “TheCatSatOnTheM” and “L1v3L0ngAndPr0sp” while a human can easily finish those, a computer can’t.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think you missed my point</p>
<p>They are very common well known phrases which should &#8220;never be used&#8221; as password crackers have these in their databases.</p>
<p>All I&#8217;ve done is a little obfuscation by in the first case capitalising the initial letters of each word (so the last two are &#8220;at&#8221;). And in the second use &#8220;leet speak&#8221; substitution (so the last two should be &#8220;3r&#8221; not &#8220;er&#8221; as some might think).</p>
<p>The point is password crackers have these two obfuscation rules built in as standard, along with many others including different countries keyboard mappings.</p>
<p>So whilst the might make the search by a password cracker longer, those passwords will be searched for so found.</p>
<p>In effect the substitution is known.</p>
<p>So what effect does it have?</p>
<p>The base phrase &#8220;thecatsatonthemat&#8221; is 17 lower cas chars.</p>
<p>This makes the brut force search space 17^26 ~1e32 or ~2^107</p>
<p>But with upper case letters the brut force search space is now 17^52 ~1e64 or ~2^214.</p>
<p>But the phrase is just one of maybe a few thousand stock phrases, lets be generous and say 8192 or 2^13 which is a tiny search space.</p>
<p>Now with a &#8220;known rule&#8221; of capitalise each words initial letter it only doubles the search space or adds just 1bit to it&#8230;</p>
<p>With eight rules it only adds 3bits of increas to the search space, so each rule adds only 3/8ths or 0.375 of a bit&#8230; Each &#8220;known rule&#8221; adds a decreasing bit value to the search space&#8230;</p>
<p>So the difference between a 17 char random string and known string all in lower case is 2^107 -v- 2^13</p>
<p>But the nieve expectation of using capitals is the search space goes up to 2^214 not the reality of 2^14&#8230;</p>
<p>Hence many tend to think about some immense value in such rules, where as the reality is only fractions of a bit increase if the password cracker knows the base phrase and the obfuscation rule being used.</p>
<p>For some reason most do not see passwords the way the developers of password crackers do&#8230;</p>

<p>A MITM Attack could tell you</p>
<p>&#8220;Password length 6-6 chars.&#8221;</p>
<p>The result would be a lot weaker but still be within the host system rule set.</p>

				<p>The worst is when they want a shorter password than you&#8217;ve given them, but silently clip off the unwanted characters from end of string; but then your password manager doesn&#8217;t know it, and your password fails next time you try to log in.</p>

				<p>Creating a password generator that works for (theoretically) all rulesets would significantly reduce the search space for brute-forcing passwords.</p>
<p>The best ruleset is no ruleset* but only if you can trust your users to generate safe passwords.</p>

<p>If I think about what bad things an adversary might do if they have the ability to inject a MITM attack on the password registration web page, I cannot imagine why they would care about changing the password rules communicated to the user.</p>
<p>But, regardless, that MITM on the password rules is present even without this attribute. Usually the website describes the password rules in some form, which could still be intercepted. This just puts them in a common standardized place.</p>

<p>It could, but will it?</p>
<p>The reason &#8220;Protocol Fall Back Attacks&#8221; have worked in the past and still work today is that,</p>
<p>&#8220;Software does not warn/tell the user what protocols are in use&#8221;.</p>
<p>This appears to be standard behaviour in the software industry. A mentality of,</p>
<p>1, Make it work regardless.<br />
2, Never worry the user.<br />
3, Users will click through anyway.</p>
<p>The first two appear to be &#8220;branding&#8221; and &#8220;support cost&#8221; issues, the third typical marketing dept cynicism.</p>
<p>If you look at the hotel industry they alow all sorts of petty fraud to get by &#8220;just to keep the customer happy&#8221;. But they &#8220;swallow the cost&#8221;.</p>
<p>Credit Card companies likewise alowed offline transactions even though they could be used for fraud &#8220;just to keep the customer happy&#8221;. But they would try to make the customer, merchant, or bank &#8220;swallow the cost&#8221;</p>
<p>Debit Card banks positively encorage low value fraud with NFC &#8220;tap-n-pay&#8221; systems &#8220;just to keep the,customer happy&#8221;. But they try to force the customer, or merchant &#8220;swallow the cost&#8221;</p>
<p>We are not talking small sums of money here the Card Payment Industry tries to keep it &#8220;hidden&#8221; but at one point they indicated 4% of either transactions or turnover&#8230;</p>
<p>That is the power of &#8220;just to keep the customer happy&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Brand names are even more important managment does not want a &#8220;user product&#8221; getting a bad name because some idiot site developer can not be bothered to secure things properly, so why worry the user with flashing red signs or popups? After all it&#8217;s more likely to be some idiot news site, magazine or food blogger site than anything important.</p>
<p>Cory Doctorow has a piece over on his link site about getting attacked,</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/13/opsec-soup-to-nuts/#secured" rel="nofollow ugc">https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/13/opsec-soup-to-nuts/#secured</a></p>
<p>Note his software did not warn him about the link being potentially dodgy, and his after thoughts of,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;I&#8217;d created my Twitter account while standing in line for a Game Developer&#8217;s Conference press pass, after Ev Williams sent me an invite to the beta. I didn&#8217;t think I needed a good password for it, because it was a toy that sent you updates about other people&#8217;s lunches over SMS. Half a decade later, I had tens of thousands of followers and the account was key to my professional life.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>What would Cory Dotorow&#8217;s accounts be worth today?</p>

				<p>Actual exchange with an admin.</p>
<p>Me:<br />
The password I’m trying to set is DIPq$22eXAcghjt9, but I get the following error message:<br />
New password is not strong enough.</p>
<p>Admin:<br />
One of the conditions for a password is that it cannot contain dictionary words.  The password, below, has DIP in it.  I guessing that is the issue.</p>

				<p>Just received this gem:</p>
<blockquote><p>

3. Mandatory special character. Please be advised that the only special character that system is accepting for now is a $ character.

				<p>Yeah, and then there are those that have no idea how to escape characters for their database and thus refuse to allow backslashes or quotes in passwords.</p>
<p>Wait, we no longer store plaintext passwords, and PHP has some sensible SQL escaping these days (assuming that you remember to actually use it, natch). No matter, we still reject those characters.</p>
<p>The most fun I had recently was with one that accepted UTF8 for registration, but I had to hack the HTTP:POST data encoding to LATIN1 in order to log in. Of course it worked on <em>their</em> system.</p>
