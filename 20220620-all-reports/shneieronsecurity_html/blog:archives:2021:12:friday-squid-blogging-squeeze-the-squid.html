				<p>Apple has alerted 11 U.S. Embassy employees that their iPhones had been hacked in recent months by Pegasus spyware from NSO Group, an Israel-based company that licenses software to government clients in dozens of countries that allows them to secretly steal files, eavesdrop on conversations and track the movements of its targets, according to people familiar with the notifications.</p>

				<p>Civil Rights, in Absence, Confer a Level of Civic Security?</p>
<p>What say ye&#8230;</p>
<p>With the attack and outright disregard for civil and human rights in the United States, does this represent a threat to individual or collective security? Does life and liberty infer a right to its pursuit? Does self governance require individuals to honor others rights? As those that confuse political and governance as purely an exercise do not recognize the personal security it affords. Devolving into a &#8220;might makes right&#8221; renders many vulnerable to a authoritarian aggregation of power and control.</p>

				<p>@name.withheld.for.obvious.reasons</p>
<p>This is a problem around the world. The internet and the flow of information threatens “might makes right”, hence we see an increasing flow of disinformation and misinformation, much from authoritarian states.</p>
<p>The free flow of information also threatens the privileged members of society, who have long &#8216;closed ranks&#8217; to maintain this privilege. Hence they are only too willing to allow the increase of surveillance powers, in a hope it will help them maintain their authoritative and privileged position.</p>
<p>A jab in the arm is uncomfortable, but the soothing surveillance of the electronic panopticon is oh so subtle and comforting. It will surely keep us all safe from all the terrifying and confronting changes that assault our senses on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I am hoping to achieve the lowest possible social credit score, and I won&#8217;t be moving an inch on that (mostly because I won&#8217;t be free to move an inch because of that low score).</p>

				<p>Earlier this year, the Australian Capital Territory’s highest court, the ACT court of appeal, ruled that Collaery’s trial should be held in the open, citing the importance of open justice and the need to deter political prosecutions.</p>
<p>But the ACT court of appeal never published its reasons for making that decision, because the Commonwealth wanted them partly suppressed on national security grounds.</p>
<p>The court of appeal refused to redact the judgement.</p>
<p>In a dramatic escalation late on Friday, the Commonwealth sought leave to appeal in the high court to have parts of the judgement suppressed.</p>
<p>The attorney-general Michaelia Cash did not respond to requests for comment. But the high court confirmed the application had been filed.<br />
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/03/bernard-collaerys-lawyers-say-governments-secret-evidence-would-cause-irreparable-prejudice" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/03/bernard-collaerys-lawyers-say-governments-secret-evidence-would-cause-irreparable-prejudice</a></p>
<p>Justice David Mossop questioned whether there is any prospect of completing the prosecution of Mr Collaery, given the process to update the evidence could take in excess of a year given any appeals.</p>
<p>Justice Mossop said he was &#8220;thinking out loud&#8221; when pondering if the evidence and the case would be &#8220;stuck in a perpetual vortex of being updated&#8221;.</p>
<p>He also queried whether his decision was constrained by the ruling of the appeal&#8217;s court, which overturned his decision to have the case heard in secret.<br />
<a href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/7505356/judge-asks-will-collaery-case-ever-end/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/7505356/judge-asks-will-collaery-case-ever-end/</a></p>
<p>It’s the latest in a never-ending, Kafkaesque attempt to prosecute the barrister and former ACT attorney-general for offences stemming from the disclosure of information about Australia’s bugging of the Timor-Leste government.<br />

<p>It&#8217;s a very common practice. Also backdoors are popped into equipment, then someone else finds it (like Russia discovering a certain CIA backdoor in a certain encrypted communications system, which was set up by the CIA and sold to a certain other country).</p>
<p>Wiretapping from an embassy is illegal in nearly every country. But that is precisely the task of the SCS, as is evidenced by another secret document.<br />

				<p>Australia has offered to share profits 80-20 in Timor Leste&#8217;s favour, but with the oil and gas processed in Darwin.</p>
<p>Timor Leste wants a 70-30 split but with processing done in its own country to encourage the growth of a domestic processing industry.<br />

<p>Australia has been ordered to cease spying on East Timor and its legal advisers, in a landmark decision by the International Court of Justice relating to a bitter dispute between the two countries over $40 billion of oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea.<br />

				<p>East Timor is one of the poorest nations in the world.</p>
<p>Normally a dispute such as this would be referred to the International Court of Justice or the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for an impartial decision, but the Australian government had withdrawn from these international jurisdictions (solely on matters relating to maritime boundaries) shortly before East Timorese independence.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, under public and diplomatic pressure, the Australian government offered instead a last-minute concession solely on royalties from the Greater Sunrise gas field.<br />
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051201131559/http://www.crikey.com.au/articles/2005/05/09-1204-7954.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://web.archive.org/web/20051201131559/http://www.crikey.com.au/articles/2005/05/09-1204-7954.html</a></p>
<p>Other developments within waters claimed by East Timor but outside the JPDA (Laminaria-Corallina and Buffalo) continue to be exploited unilaterally by Australia, however.<br />

				<p>Steve Bracks, a former Victoria state premier and founder of the Timor-Leste Governance Project aid organization, described Australia continuing to take revenue from Bayu Undan as &#8220;pretty outrageous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie Scheiner, a researcher at La&#8217;o Hamutuk, an East Timorese research institute, said Australia had made $5 billion from oil and gas that it now agrees is in East Timor&#8217;s territory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Australia had no right to get 10% of Bayu Undan,&#8221; Scheiner told Australian Broadcasting Corp. &#8220;We hope that Australia will do the right thing and repay the money that it took from now things that they don&#8217;t even claim belong to Australia anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did not comment on the question of compensation, but said in a statement on Tuesday: &#8220;We look forward to formally bringing the treaty into force as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The treaty states that &#8220;the parties agree that neither party shall have a claim for compensation with respect to petroleum activities conducted in the Timor Sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rothwell described that clause as &#8220;a little unusual,&#8221; and reflected the multiple Timor Sea agreements over the decades that Australia had with Indonesia then East Timor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having that sort of compensation clause is really a lawyer&#8217;s way of making sure that there&#8217;s no further comeback on these issues,&#8221; Rothwell said.<br />

<p>You need considerably higher power than a router to emit energy capable of causing any damage. Electronics have strict rules to stay within the safety range which is very safe, by a very considerable margin.</p>
<p>However, the Russian government isn&#8217;t concerned with such matters as stupid rules in other countries, they have a more nihilistic approach and produce a very high powered device, that needs to be transported by vehicle due it&#8217;s significant size and power requirements.</p>
<p>&#8220;During a visit to Moscow earlier this month, Burns raised the issue with the leadership of Russia’s Federal Security Service, the FSB, and the country’s Foreign Intelligence Service, the SVR. He told them that causing U.S. personnel and their family members to suffer severe brain damage and other debilitating ailments would go beyond the bounds of acceptable behavior for a “professional intelligence service,” said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss highly sensitive conversations.&#8221;<br />
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/cia-havana-syndrome-russians-warning/2021/11/24/6d5a6e26-4d40-11ec-94ad-bd85017d58dc_story.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/cia-havana-syndrome-russians-warning/2021/11/24/6d5a6e26-4d40-11ec-94ad-bd85017d58dc_story.html</a></p>

<p>The Russian government is in the process of moving some equipment currently.</p>
<p>Footage shows a line of military troop-carrying trucks steaming down a highway in Bryansk around 100 miles from the border.<br />

<p>Additionally, the document states that “equipment may be left behind at different training ranges to enable a rapid, final buildup.”<br />
<a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/4204172/us-intelligence-russia-massing-troops-border-ukraine-offensive/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.the-sun.com/news/4204172/us-intelligence-russia-massing-troops-border-ukraine-offensive/</a></p>
<p>“Additionally, in the past month, our information indicates Russian influence proxies and media outlets have started to increase content denigrating Ukraine and NATO, in part to pin the blame for a potential Russian military escalation on Ukraine,” the official said.</p>
<p>“Recent information also indicates that Russian officials proposed adjusting Russia’s information operations against Ukraine to emphasize the narrative that Ukrainian leaders had been installed by the West, harbored a hatred for the ‘Russian world,’ and were acting against the interests of the Ukrainian people.”</p>
<p>In his comments in Latvia, Blinken cautioned the Ukrainians not to give Russia a pretext for military action.</p>
<p>“We’re also urging Ukraine to continue to exercise restraint because, again, the Russian playbook is to claim provocation for something that they were planning to do all along,” he said.<br />

<p>They may have their WIFI isolated, but what about their radio or their string quartet? If they are worried about radiation such as microwaves, why not shroud the entire house?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably a good market to corner, aimed at people that have not realized what Faraday Cages are actually for. Large cages could be sold as protection from nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The pitch:</p>
<p>The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!</p>
<p>Why bother with an expensive bunker you might never use, when you can be protected from radiation in your own home? You could even protect yourself from toothpaste, hair cream, cosmetics and suppositories that you may have left over from the 1940&#8217;s. If your smartphone isn&#8217;t working, you know it&#8217;s really working.</p>

				<p>@ Paul Suhler, Winter, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>“BARR: Biden’s ‘Infrastructure’ Bill Contains Backdoor ‘Kill Switch’ For Cars”</p></blockquote>
<p>You can kick the &#8220;political rhetoric&#8221; to the curb side, the capability is already built into many cars for &#8220;insurance reasons&#8221; using OnStar. Read,</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnStar" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnStar</a></p>
<p>And look for &#8220;Advanced Automatic Collision Notification&#8221; (also does eratic driving notification) and &#8220;Stolen Vehicle Slowdown&#8221; (also does stop).</p>
<p>The technology started being put in US vehicles over a decade ago.</p>
<p>The only thing that was not there was the legislation enabaling Police Use without a court order.</p>
<p>But it could have been done at any time by a number of insurance companies quite legally.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why I wish people would read the small print in the documents of what goods they buy (car) likewise what services (insurance) they get.</p>
<p>Currently some insurance policies alow the insurance company to monitor your driving style via OnStar or similar and charge you appropriately. As they can change that charge at any point in time they can technically void your insurance whilst you are driving so slow you down and stop you&#8230;</p>
<p>Sometimes that &#8220;good deal&#8221; is not at all good when you consider all the legal possibilities.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;To be clear, we are aware of others having successfully factored the key, but we arrived at our solution independently. Here&#8217;s how we did it.</i></p>
<p>Something about factoring a key but I don&#8217;t understand what this is, or even what the point of it is. I guess something to do with signing digital certificates.</p>

<blockquote><p>I don’t know anything about this below other than having read the tweet, but it looks to me like this pdf viewer that is mentioned, is used for academia stuff for viewing academic papers online, but supposedly it sort of records your reading habits, or so it is claimed:</p></blockquote>
<p>This sort of thing has been going on to my certain knowledge for the past three decades.</p>
<p>I was aware of it first being told of it in the 1980&#8217;s as the reason why Big Phama and similar do all research &#8220;in house&#8221; including looking up citations, papers and patents. That is they would buy the databases via obscure front companies and similar and then only run them on closed and issolated internal networks.</p>
<p>The reason was to stop what are &#8220;side channel leaks&#8221;, just looking up a paper tells a lot about what a researcher is thinking, the more citations etc or the actual search parameters are a gold mine not just for industrial espionage but investors and speculators.</p>
<p>In the 1990&#8217;s I took on a technical role for a citation database supplier. I was warned several times that our major competitor collected the information in their online offering. Unfortunately they took over the company I worked for and there behaviour was confirmed when I went through the source code. It was the reason they and I parted company. As far as I am aware nearly twenty years later what little is left is &#8220;online only&#8221; so researchers in Universities and the like are being ripped off in all ways imaginable.</p>
<p>The &#8220;publishing industry&#8221; around science is one of the most dishonest market places there is and it&#8217;s costing research, universities and similar billions with it&#8217;s fraudulent behaviours very year one way or another&#8230;</p>
<p>They have even approached me some years ago to write a book&#8230; obviously I was somewhat flattered who wouldn&#8217;t be. However my sixth sense said there was something hinky&#8230; So I looked into what they actually did and phoned around a few people I knew&#8230; The result I was horrified by what I found out. A few carefully chosen questions over a nice lunch kind of confirmed what they were upto so after they paid the bill I said I had things to think about as to how I was going to rearange work scheduals to fit it in. Then led them on for a while before saying that I was realy to busy.</p>
<p>In short they wanted me to spend about a year of my life writing a book, which they would pay royalties on, but no advanced fee. I checked through friends in university libraries and they basically said it was a scam as they would only print up a hundred or so books in hard back and only try to sell them to Uni libraries in the UK at around ~two dollars a page so a very high income per item. However the royalties were based on the number of copies sold starting at cents and getting upto maybe a couple of dollars, but with penalty claw backs based on unsold copies&#8230;</p>

				<p>@ Curious,</p>
<blockquote><p>What are ‘vanity RSA keys’?</p></blockquote>
<p>It depends on who you ask.</p>
<p>One type is where you generate lots of keys looking for ones that start or end with your organisational name&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kvdveer/vanity_rsa" rel="nofollow ugc">https://github.com/kvdveer/vanity_rsa</a></p>
<p>For obvious reasons these are very rare as the larger the organisational name the more searching you have to do.</p>
<p>However RSA keys can &#8220;hide information&#8221; in them because they are generated in a highly redundant way. It&#8217;s the basis of &#8220;Kleptocryptography&#8221;. A point noted in a paper in 1980.</p>
<p>On such form of hiding would be a short indicator as to where to start a prime search to find one of the two primes, thus critically weakening the public key[1].</p>
<p>However such redundancy means that RSA keys come in a range from veey weak to quite strong.</p>
<p>If you think about it the search for a vanity key puts constraints on what primes you can use. As a consequence it would make weak keys more likely.</p>
<p>[1] As I&#8217;ve mentioned before on this blog I once backdoored an RSA key generation program quite a few years ago as not just a proof of concept but also as proof that code audits were not a security panacea. The &#8220;secret&#8221; was generated using a quite short PubKey that encrypted a truely randomly generated number. The TRNG number was then determanisticly lengthened and used as the start point for the prime search for one of the two primes. The prime search then looked for two primes that when multiplied put the &#8220;secret&#8221; in the upper bits of the final RSA PubKey&#8230;</p>
