		<h2 class="entry">Law Enforcement Access to Chat Data and Metadata</h2>
		<p>A January 2021 FBI <a href="https://propertyofthepeople.org/document-detail/?doc-id=21114562">document</a> outlines what types of data and metadata can be lawfully obtained by the FBI from messaging apps. <i>Rolling Stone</i> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/whatsapp-imessage-facebook-apple-fbi-privacy-1261816/">broke</a> the story and it&#8217;s been written about <a href="https://reason.com/2021/12/07/secret-documents-show-which-message-apps-are-the-most-fbi-proof/">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see a lot of surprises in the document. Lots of apps leak all sorts of metadata: iMessage and WhatsApp seem to be the worst. Signal protects the most metadata. End-to-end encrypted message content can be available if the user uploads it to an unencrypted backup server.</p>

				<p>quoting the article :<br />
&#8220;Signal will provide only the date and time someone signed up for the app and <strong>when the user last logged into the app.</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>Last time logged is a very interesting metadata though.</p>

				<p>@Bruce<br />
“Lots of apps leak all sorts of metadata: iMessage and WhatsApp seem to be the worst.”</p>
<p>Is it that these apps leak metadata or that they are the most permissibly accessible? Doesn’t law enforcement still need a legal path to obtain information from these services?</p>
<p>Also, I sort of wish someone would retype up the FBI document. Was it faxed?</p>

				<p>If you want a Rolex, you buy a Rolex.</p>
<p>Most people know why a Rolex has such a high prowess association to its name and why so many people try to sell Rolex knockoffs. In agreeing to posses a knockoff you soon find that it can&#8217;t match the reality that was in your mind surrounding a real Rolex and you&#8217;ve only done yourself a disservice in acquiring the knockoff and pretending it was the real deal.</p>
<p>So why people use WhatsApp instead of Signal is understandable as for some ignorance is their bliss or their sense of self disservice hasn&#8217;t set in yet or their brand loyalty to Facebook is more powerful. If the later part of that is true then there are far larger problems at hand then acceptance of a crappy knockoff for secure messaging.</p>

				<p>@ Bruce, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>End-to-end encrypted message content can be available if the user uploads it to an unencrypted backup server.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the truth about &#8220;encryption can not be stopped&#8221; has got into certain peoples heads.</p>
<p>They are not going to stop fighting to force what they call &#8220;lawful access&#8221; with &#8220;for the sake of the children&#8221; and other FUD. Because they will always get some increased advantage in doing so.</p>
<p>However, they are moving to &#8220;spyware on the user device&#8221; where &#8220;plaintext&#8221; is available and &#8220;spyware on the cloud server&#8221;.</p>
<p>I fully exoect these to be the &#8220;Next battle grounds for the golden key&#8221; over the next decade.</p>
<p>It can be fought and yes it can easily be technically beaten.</p>
<p>But you and I both know,</p>
<blockquote><p>User convenience trumos all.</p></blockquote>
<p>For just about all, most will not recognise the harm they are doing. Others will hear very little, after they the hear the lock and key rattle at the start of &#8220;Special Administrative Measures&#8221;(SAM) for life or worse.</p>

				<p>I believe we should assume all of our phones are compromised (either by nations or advanced cyber criminals) or can be at any moment. If this assumption is true, then we have no secret keys and there is no end to end encryption. Call me crazy/paranoid, but I&#8217;m increasingly convinced this is true.</p>

				<p>@cybersmorgasbord, ALL</p>
<p>That’s awesome!! Thank you!</p>
<p>I wasn’t exactly sure how to interpret the search warrant info for Apple iMessage from the FBI’s document, particularly whether access to iMessage content was allowed.</p>
<p>However, the ‘<b>r</b>eason’ article that Bruce linked to (under the word ‘elsewhere’) does a really great job of being more explicit about this.</p>
<p>The short answer is ‘yes’ the FBI can access iMessage content if you back it up to iCloud (although Apple had fought against this, unsuccessfully.) Andrea provides more excellent details in her article.</p>
<p>She also brings to light something that I hadn’t thought about, which was the date on the document &#8211; January 7, 2021. This would have been the day after the attack on the US capital.</p>

				<p>@ ALL,</p>
<p>It should be noted that there is a bit more to this than at first it might appear.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably best for most people to &#8220;draw a diagram&#8221; to get their mind around things but hey as the old adage has it &#8220;A picture is worth a thousand words&#8221;, I&#8217;ll try for a fee less.</p>
<p>Most important to understand,</p>
<p>1, There is a big big difference between a &#8220;system&#8221; and a &#8220;subsystem&#8221; which forms part of it.</p>
<p>2, Systems are made as &#8220;chains of subsystems&#8221; that for reliability and availability, NOT security can be paralleled up.</p>
<p>3, A system is only as strong as the weakest link in the system.</p>
<p>Therefor consider that a &#8220;secure messaging App&#8221; might be quite strong, but it is pointless, if other links in the chain are weak or compleatly broken, as many are.</p>
<p>So you have to consider &#8220;the WHOLE system&#8221; when doing your security analysis not just one subsystem.</p>
<p>4, The less complex subsystems are often called &#8220;components&#8221; in general these are not capable of being secure on their own.</p>
<p>5, Only by carefull considered design can components with no inherent security be made into secure subsystems and so eventually secure systems.</p>
<p>The &#8220;secure&#8221; design process is first and formost a &#8220;Quality Process&#8221; if you don&#8217;t understand QProc design then you&#8217;ve got a large mountain to climb. BUT over and above QProc design there are a whole bunch of non intuative design rules based on a solid understanding of the laws of physics, reasoned logic, and mathmatics. Few people have the skills or experience to design secure systems without having to resort to rules of thumb to give mitigation, which then necescitates extensive testing that again few posses the knowledge and skills to do to the required level.</p>
<p>So be distrustful of systems designed by &#8220;one man bands&#8221; or even &#8220;teams&#8221; where the expertise can not be verified by you or others that have the required knowledge and ability to assess them. That by the way also means,</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not implicitly trust what I say, VERIFY what I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also do it as a &#8220;continuing process&#8221; as QProc requires for design, manufacture, operation, and EOL disposal.</p>
<p>As now should be clear to everyone, computer hardware can no more be trusted, than software, and likewise the firmware that joins the two. Or for that matter any other part of the computing stack from the lowly circuit trace from transistor to transistor that is part of the logic that makes up the hundred of thousands of parts you do not see behind the &#8220;Instruction Set Architecture&#8221;(ISA) at the chip pin out.</p>
<p>I have no idea just how many vulnerabilities will be found this year only a small number of them will get &#8220;official recognition&#8221; by CERT, and they will number in the tens of thousands[1]. Yes, that ages old &#8220;eternal vigilance&#8221; quote realy does have teeth, and those that ignore it will at some point get bitten.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to go any further into the design rules other than say you need to be aware as a minimum,</p>
<p>A, Issolation can be a friend.<br />
B, Efficiency is dangerous.<br />
C, All channels are bidirectional.<br />
D, Bandwidth should be minimal.<br />
E, All work is inefficient.<br />
F, All energy and matter can be modulated.<br />
G, All modulation carries information.<br />
H, All errors are communications.</p>
<p>And quite a few more besides, getting your head around them and relating them to the laws of physics takes time.</p>
<p>But what about a description at the system level</p>
<p>Put simply to communicate requires as a minimum a &#8220;Shannon Information Channel&#8221; that has a transmitter at the originating end and a receiver at the recipient end. The first party has a channel between them and the transmitter and likewise there is a channel from the receiver to the second party. Normally this pair of paths are not discussed, however in security work you have to be acutely aware they exist and have characteristics that usually makes them insecure by default (ie &#8220;plaintext&#8221;).</p>
<p>The channel between the transmitter and reciver has certain characteristics, such as at minimum bandwidth, loss, and noise. What is not often mentioned is that the noise can be natural (what some call QRN) or manmade (what some call QRM). The level of the signal to the total noise defines an expected error rate for the type of signal. Man made noise falls into two varieties &#8220;consequential&#8221; and &#8220;deliberate&#8221;. We tend to call consequential noise &#8220;background&#8221; and assume in most casses it can be modeled as random or &#8220;Average Gaussian White Noise&#8221;(AGWN). Deliberate noise however is not random and can be purposeful such as &#8220;jamming&#8221; or from other channels as &#8220;cross modulation&#8221; and the like.</p>
<p>Which brings us to a &#8220;third party&#8221; on the channel. Jamming is used by a third party to raise the effective noise threshold such that communications between the transmitter and receiver are disrupted. Cross modulation carries information thus forms a &#8220;side channel&#8221; which a third party can use.</p>
<p>One example of a side channel is &#8220;trimming uncertainty&#8221; or &#8220;jitter&#8221; which originates at some point in the trasmission device. With poorly implemented stream cipher systems no matter how strong the key-stream, if jitter originates in the mixer (XOR gate) then carefull observation by the third party might well result in them being easily able to strip off the key-stream. Similar issues arise with block ciphers and public key ciphers as well.</p>
<p>But most practical communications systems have to have some kind of control system. Which requires &#8220;signalling mechanisms&#8221;. These can be &#8220;in band&#8221; or &#8220;out of band&#8221;. In band signalling reserves some of the characters for channel control, hrnce &#8220;Control Characters&#8221;. In times past of Full Duplex Serial communications &#8220;Ctrl-S&#8221; sent to a remote system would stop it transmitting, &#8220;Ctrl-Q&#8221; would start it again. Out of band signalling requires another communications channel, back in the davs of V.24/28 signalling (RS232 signalling) there would be additional wires that were used in pairs such as CTS/RTS DSR/DTR.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that in nearly all communications there is hidden away an implicit extra channel for handeling error conditions and the &#8220;back channel&#8221; can be used to attack a secure system in a number of ways.</p>
<p>In modern data communications many &#8220;logical channels&#8221; share the same &#8220;physical channel&#8221; and this represents a significant risk.</p>
<p>The logical channels have to be &#8220;demultiplexed in the receiver by the &#8220;communications stack&#8221; which is generally a function of the &#8220;Operating System&#8221;(OS). As the OS also handles the &#8220;User Interface&#8221;(UI) which for most secure messaging Apps is &#8220;plaintext&#8221; then no matter how secure the App is any weakness in the OS can potentially alow an attacker to compleatly bypass the Apps Security in an &#8220;End Run Attack&#8221;. Such attacks are way way more likely than Crypto attacks on the logical communications channel.</p>
<p>Though not directly seen on the FBI sheet, the Apple iPhone suffers from a very significant &#8220;end run attack&#8221; which is all the Apps files stored in &#8220;plaintext&#8221; become available whenever the users phone syncs to the Apple backup which happens automatically unless the user takes care not just to ensure it is off, but stays off, it can be turned back on by an &#8220;Over The Air&#8221;(OTA) update.</p>
<p>But even &#8220;End to End Encryption&#8221;(E2EE) has real issues&#8230;</p>
<p>It is not at all secure in &#8220;group&#8221; or &#8220;broadcast&#8221; messages. Some Apps can be left in &#8220;group&#8221; mode in which case E2EE is easily broken by just adding a &#8220;ghost user&#8221;.</p>
<p>Worse E2EE can be not realy what you might think E2EE should be due to &#8220;Key Managment&#8221;(KeyMan) issues. Think about the who/how of not just &#8220;Key Generation&#8221;(KeyGen) but how it is distributed by &#8220;Key Communications&#8221;(KeyCom) or distribution (KeyDist). There are a whole manner of ways this can be done, many are not in reality as secure as their descriptions and &#8220;proofs&#8221; might lead you to think.</p>
<p>Finally consider this,</p>
<p>In the US the rules are in effect &#8220;encrypted comms&#8221; once pulled from the wire can be kept indefinitely what appears to all intents and purposes to be &#8220;plaintext&#8221; can not, though the rules are a real mess to rven understand let alone work through. In Australia and the UK there are other rules that can get you sent to jail, simply because you have no idea what the &#8220;message key&#8221; is, even if you can provide the plaintext of any requested message (from storage etc).</p>
<p>Currently all secure messaging Apps give away the fact they are sending encrypted messages one way or another.</p>
<p>So not only are you opening yourself up to having your messages held for ever, you are also &#8220;painting a target on your back&#8221; that at the very least can open you up to all sorts of legal abuse you can not defend yourself against no matter what you do.</p>
<p>The way things are going politically with Law Enforcment, sooner rather than later they are going to bring the hammer down on people to scare everyone else into stop using either all encrypted messaging Apps or the ones they can not work around.</p>
<p>There are ways that you can communicate securely whilst sending &#8220;plaintext&#8221; such methods are &#8220;ages old&#8221; and when used correctly have saved many peoples lives.</p>
<p>One such was the correct use of &#8220;Duress Codes&#8221; by SOE agents during WWII. However the stupidity of the &#8220;Dutch Section&#8221; of SOE in London shows what can go horribly wrong, as it ment many individuals got captured, tourtured, and killed.</p>
<p>[1] It was just under seventeen and a half thousand last year, and we are a thousand up on that already this year with another 6% of the year to go (holidays mean nothing to crackers). That&#8217;s going to be over 53 per day, any one of which might effect your &#8220;secure system&#8221; even if you do not realise it.</p>

				<p>I think the main thrust of the Rolling Stone piece is problem of corporations making semi-false statements to their customers. To be blunt, Apple and Facebook [or Meta] almost committed fraud or betrayal of their &#8220;valued privacy concerned customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Apple and WhatsApp have built themselves into multibillion-dollar behemoths, they’ve done it while preaching the importance of privacy, especially when it comes to secure messaging&#8230; Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has articulated a “privacy-focused vision” built around WhatsApp, the most popular messaging service in the world. Apple CEO Tim Cook says privacy is a “basic human right” and&#8230; For journalists, activists, and government critics&#8230;political retribution&#8230;facing imminent danger&#8230;A judge later sentenced Edwards to six months in prison.&#8221; -RollingStone</p>
<p>In these times scamming customers is business as usual. I will say this is the same one-way mirror abuse where citizens who are paying the salaries of FBI agents yet not being able to verify what government agents are actually doing is also SOP.</p>
<p>PS: Excuse all of the mistakes I short of time and have poor equipment .  My handle is a variation of my old handle used here years ago.</p>
