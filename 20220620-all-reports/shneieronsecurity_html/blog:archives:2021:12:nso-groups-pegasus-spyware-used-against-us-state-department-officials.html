		<h2 class="entry">NSO Group’s Pegasus Spyware Used Against US State Department Officials</h2>
		<p>NSO Group&#8217;s descent into Internet pariah status continues. Its Pegasus spyware <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-us-state-department-phones-hacked-with-israeli-company-spyware-sources-2021-12-03/">was used</a> against nine US State Department employees. We don&#8217;t know which NSO Group customer trained the spyware on the US. But the company does:</p>
<blockquote><p>NSO Group said in a statement on Thursday that it did not have any indication their tools were used but canceled access for the relevant customers and would investigate based on the Reuters inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;If our investigation shall show these actions indeed happened with NSO&#8217;s tools, such customer will be terminated permanently and legal actions will take place,&#8221; said an NSO spokesperson, who added that NSO will also &#8220;cooperate with any relevant government authority and present the full information we will have.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<p>I apologize for going broad before I go specific here. But I just learned of a good book through a recent ‘On Point’ podcast.</p>
<p>The podcast episode was titled <b>‘Why the U.S. is cracking down on international spyware.’</b></p>
<p>Steven Feldstein was one of the guests. He is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He is also the author of the 2021-published book “The Rise of Digital Repression.”</p>
<p>I just stated reading the book.</p>
<p>What I found interesting at the start was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There is a growing consensus that the world is experiencing a “third wave of autocratization.”</p>
<p>  […] 92 countries or 54 percent of the world’s population currently live under authoritarian rule.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t think the risks of autocratization are being overstated. Technology offers a HUGE (and to many an irresistible) platform on which to express their <b>highly-competitive drive for dominance.</b></p>
<p>I also think it helps to have some context as note-worthy stories continue to pepper the news.</p>
<p>***Does anyone else recommend any good books or podcasts on these topics?</p>
<p>Citizen Lab’s John Scott-Railton is also an important guest on the episode, with much good information to share.</p>

<p>Yes, probably any book from the 1980s. Including the players&#8217; manual for Shadowrun.</p>

<p>I have been saying for the last decade that we have entered a new age of autocracy. It is vital to grasp, however, that this autocracy is not based in traditional notions of dominance such as a monarchy, noblism, etc. Rather it hearkens back to the ancient Roman notion of the Praetorian Guard. I was unsurprised to find in the bowels of the organizations sponsoring 1/6 an organization that included just that name. Trump fancies himself an Augustus but in reality he is more Claudius. Putin represents the vanguard of this historical movement. It is a new world order based upon &#8220;what have you got on me;&#8221; a rule based upon fear rather than aspirations.</p>
<p>America dodged a bullet this past winter but never mistake the battle for the war. Trump failed for now but he or others will try again, make no mistake. The purveyors of surveillance capitalism such as Facebook and Apple don&#8217;t give a crap who their masters are so long as they can return value to their shareholders. Everyone needs to grasp that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not a bet on the future of America, they are a bet upon what will happen in the West when a democratic America is no more and the dollar cannot maintain its status as a reserve currency. A new kind of autocracy needs a new kind of currency; Bitcoin is it.</p>
<p>The historical movement is much deeper and broader than &#8220;digital repression&#8221;. That&#8217;s just a tool of the trade.</p>

				<p>@ Bruce, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>We don’t know which NSO Group customer trained the spyware on the US. But the company does.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does it realy matter, due to the old &#8220;If not Peter then Paul&#8221; principle.</p>
<p>That is it was inevitable it was going to happen the only question in reality is,</p>
<p>&#8220;Why has it taken so long?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a logical result of having such a market exist, people aquire product, people use product. The fact it gets used by people A on people B is fairly irrelevant especially when people B have been doing similar not just on people A and C through Z but also on citizens of B as well&#8230;</p>
<p>The things most people have not twigged though is,</p>
<p>1, This is an arms race.<br />
2, The war started last century.</p>
<p>The war may not be directly kinetic, but it&#8217;s definitely being faught.</p>
<p>Most here are aware that NOBUS does not work with back doors because,</p>
<p>&#8220;As any enginer knows, any exploit is a total exploit&#8221;</p>
<p>People have not realised that NOBUS is a compleatly false idea that is,</p>
<p>&#8220;As any observer of history knows, any idea with utility becomes a global idea, you can not stop it&#8221;.</p>
<p>The best you can hope for is a slim lead, but as technology improves that lead gets slimmer and slimmer, untill it&#8217;s gone.</p>
<p>Like it or not the market for such products as NSO supply is high, between 10-20% of the population in Western Nations would by and use such software on each other without the blink of an eye&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just the way that &#8220;aberrant people&#8221; think and behave, worse they also believe they are &#8220;entitled&#8221; to do so&#8230;</p>

<p>Nah, simply 1920/1930&#8217;s fascism and 1950/1960&#8217;s apartheid/segregation. White males feeling entitled to their dominant position and using violence to force it upon the rest of society.</p>

<p>Good point. But it’s here now. And for some it’s really bad.</p>

<p>From the Reuters Article:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  hit U.S. officials either based in Uganda or focused on matters concerning the East African country
</p></blockquote>
<p>So do we postulate that it was the Ugandan government that placed the spyware?</p>
<p>Wasn’t it @Izzy who posted the WaPo article that had a tweet from Ugandan politician Norbert Mao? That tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  When you wake up to a threat notification from @Apple that your iPhone is being targeted then you know that cyber terrorism from state sponsored cyber terrorists is real.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/norbertmao/status/1463364241688305664" rel="nofollow ugc">https://twitter.com/norbertmao/status/1463364241688305664</a></p>
<p>I like this later tweet from him:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Thank you @cnni for bringing @TimothyDSnyder to speak to us about threats to democracy today. What was said about Orwell’s 1984 by a reviewer can be said of @TimothyDSnyder’s work: His work “…has made us desire freedom more earnestly (and) loathe tyranny with such fullness.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/norbertmao/status/1467222048158142465" rel="nofollow ugc">https://twitter.com/norbertmao/status/1467222048158142465</a></p>
<p>Wikipedia said this on the Ugandan government:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Transparency International has rated Uganda&#8217;s public sector as one of the most corrupt in the world. In 2016, Uganda ranked 151st worst out of 176 and had a score of 25 on a scale from 0 (perceived as most corrupt) to 100 (perceived as clean).

				<p>@ Hummdee</p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<p>blockquote&gt;Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not a bet on the future of America, they are a bet upon what will happen in the West when a democratic America is no more and the dollar cannot maintain its status as a reserve currency. A new kind of autocracy needs a new kind of currency; Bitcoin is it.</p>
<p>Agreed. Considering that what lies ahead is a technological dystopia,  Bitcoin seems quite a natural fit for it.</p>
<p>Every way you look at the global pandemonium you talk about, you can see the signature of social media. The current state of affairs can be directly mapped to the rise of the “web 2.0“, notably social media. It is the source of all current cultural and political conflicts and misunderstandings, besides the decline in scientific thinking and the explosion of superstition. It is necessary to act quickly against further deterioration of the social environment. There is no doubt that social media is the primary cause of the collapse of public dialogue and eventually the collapse of democracy itself. We need to contain them, somehow. Contain Meta. Contain the mediating algorithms of human interactions. Is is already late, but we still can rebuild what has been lost. We have must act NOW.</p>

				<p>Did you guys see this from Slashdot?</p>
<p><b>“Spyware Firm NSO Mulls Shutdown of Pegasus Unit, Sale of Company”</b></p>
<p>“The prospective new owners include two American funds that have discussed taking control and closing Pegasus, one of the people said. Under that scenario, the funds would then inject about $200 million in fresh capital to turn the know-how behind Pegasus into strictly defensive cyber security services, and perhaps develop the Israeli company’s drone technology, one of the people said.”</p>

				<p>@ Ted,</p>
<blockquote><p>What do you all think of this? Strictly defensive? What does that even mean?</p></blockquote>
<p>Horse apples&#8230;</p>
<p>Think of it as,</p>
<p>&#8220;malware -v- Antivirus&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody buys the defencive AV software unless there is a very real malware threat at quite significant level.</p>
<p>NSO is in effect a big pusher of &#8220;malware&#8221; and it&#8217;s been very profitable for them as it was a lucrative niche market with eye wateringly expensive product with few direct costs so very high return.</p>
<p>As we know AV software is almost given away these days and even then people just don&#8217;t buy it&#8230;</p>
<p>After all do you have AV software on your phone or other Smart Devices? Probably not, few do and they would not want to pay more than a couple of bucks for it &#8220;through the store&#8221;.</p>
<p>But AV software is a tale of two sides&#8230; For AV to work it is said it has to get into the very heart of your device, and effectively own it. It is in effect little diferent to malware or ransomware in where it gets in only the payloads differ slightly.</p>
<p>Which means AV software adds significant vulnerability vectors to your device as well as &#8220;ET Phone Home&#8221; loading of files upto the &#8220;mother ship&#8221; etc. Remember what was said about Kaspersky AV and the Russia state allegedly looking over it&#8217;s shoulder?</p>
<p>Hence the latest &#8220;want&#8221; by the West&#8217;s Guard Labour is not for &#8220;golden key front doors&#8221;, &#8220;NOBUS backdoors&#8221; or what ever they call then today. No they want full unfettered &#8220;end point access&#8221;. That is full access on your system to run file scanning and the like just ad AV software does. That &#8220;Cop-tag&#8221; CSAM system Apple is talking about is just the very thin leading edge of what the Guard Labour want.</p>
<p>After all working at what is below the OS level, it gets access to everything the user does.</p>
<p>Have a search back about the CarrierIQ software that was sending every key press back to their Internet based servers in &#8220;plaintext&#8221; as I said at the time, I would have thought the NSA was sitting at the &#8220;first upstream router&#8221; doing &#8220;collect it all&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a trove of inteligence there is very very little difference between spyware and what CarrierIQ were doing, and when you throw in the file scanning and upload features of AV software&#8230; It&#8217;s the &#8220;total surveillance&#8221; wet dream of the Guard Labour&#8230;</p>
<p>Have a think about it, it&#8217;s almost certainly comming to the next over priced Smart Phone or Device you might buy, with Apple being just that little bit more honest about it than others will be&#8230;</p>
<p>But you can be certain of one thing if money can be made from selling that sort of &#8220;back door&#8221; access then NSO will get into it because that&#8217;s the soul of their organisation to get maximum value out of stolen privacy, be it directly or as a facilitator.</p>
<p>If I was &#8220;being evil&#8221; rather than &#8220;thinking how&#8221; to be evil, it&#8217;s what I would do.</p>
<p>Think &#8220;hinky&#8221; then maybe you can stay ahead, or atleast keep it on your shoulders&#8230;</p>

				<p>The technology helping keep women safe on the streets<br />
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59520815" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59520815</a></p>
<p>&#8220;At the University of Bath, researchers are trying to solve the problem of safety products which are difficult to physically activate. They are developing a women&#8217;s smart watch app called Epowar which would automatically send alerts if it senses the user is in distress &#8211; by monitoring heart rate and body motion.</p>
<p>Co-founder, student E-J Roodt, said the idea came to her while jogging in a badly-lit park, and worrying about the risk of an attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw that smart watches were being used to detect heart attacks I thought, well, maybe that technology could be applied to women&#8217;s safety,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Although the sample size is small, the app uses artificial intelligence to recognize distress, and responds if a user is attacked when walking or running alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Founder of the bSafe app for smartphones, Rich Larsen, believes his technology could help bring about prosecutions.</p>
<p>It has an emergency alarm feature which is voice-activated. It then automatically starts live-streaming video and audio to chosen contacts, and records everything that is happening.</p>
<p>Mr Larsen said: &#8220;These recordings could be used in evidence in court cases &#8211; like rape &#8211; which are often hard to prove.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paladin, the national anti-stalking advocacy service, says tech firms need to do more to protect victims if tech is misused.</p>
<p>Rachel Horman-Brown, chairwoman of the charity, said: &#8220;Many victims are tracked and monitored through their phones or tablets by spyware.</p>
<p>&#8220;So actually stalkers don&#8217;t even need to physically get a tracking device on the victim to be able to monitor them.</p>
<p>===&gt; [still only talking, not action]&#8221;Spyware is concerning as it can enable a stalker to switch on the camera on a victim&#8217;s mobile phone, so that they can see and hear what is happening. They can also read and send text messages from the victim&#8217;s phone, as well as tracking their whereabouts.&#8221;</p>

				<p>@ Ted,</p>
<p>The history of Uganda is a long and sorry one and there was even a film &#8220;The King of Scotland&#8221; about one of it&#8217;s leaders in the 1970&#8217;s who many believe was a cannibal.</p>
<p>Bad as it sounds today, it is actually an improvment. However technology appears to be now turning the clock back.</p>
<p>In the past as a dictator or tyrant what you could do was limited by others a point Stalin understood hence his purges.</p>
<p>Technology now alows the sort of surveillance by just a handfull of people that only very very few were subject to half a century ago due to the human resources required.</p>
<p>It was why people could escape Erich and Margot Honecker&#8217;s East Germany and it&#8217;s eventual fall at the end of the 1980&#8217;s as those large numbers of &#8220;human resources&#8221; effectively turned on the regime[1]. With modern technology the human resources needed are minimal and don&#8217;t need to be that smart. So they can be selected for loyalty rather than ability and they in turn can be better watched by technology.</p>
<p>I suspect the fall of East Germany is the last we will see of that type of social liberation. Simply because of technology, in those faux cries of freedom from terrorism early this century, we have built around us not a Castle we can defend, but a Prison in which we are observed thus can be oppressed in every thought and deed.</p>
<p>[1] I have a lump of concrete with spray paint on it, that came from the Berlin wall, knocked out with a rather nice West German hammer, to remind me of what can happen if society is alowed the freedom to act.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  But AV software is a tale of two sides…
</p></blockquote>
<p>Beautifully said Clive. I was doing a little search on NSO and came across another Lawfare podcast that discusses Apple’s lawsuit against NSO.</p>
<p>It’s sort of a follow up on Lawfare’s Lubin-Kerr podcast, with some semi-interesting commentary. (Hearing a candid plan-of-approach from Apple’s lawyers would probably be the most interesting.) I am a little frustrated that I don’t understand some+ of the details, but oh well.</p>
<p>However they said much the same thing you did (ie: a tale of two sides) as Apple helped provide law enforcement with access, but then these vulns were later exploited by various groups. And how.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  But you can be certain of one thing if money can be made from selling that sort of “back door” access then NSO will get into it
</p></blockquote>
<p>I only hope that a Democratically-aligned coalition (generally speaking) secures access to the Pegasus infrastructure and nails down it’s Flagrant (with a capital F) violations, and keeps it out of the hands of parties who work against our collective interests.</p>
<p>It will be interesting for many to watch I’m sure. The money, and the mechanics, and the drones(?), etc.</p>
<p>Thanks much for your thoughtful response! So greatly appreciated 🙂</p>

<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Movies and podcasts are a nice change-up from reading. That sounds like a really interesting movie to watch. I was just listening to a bit of Steven Feldstein talking about his book (‘The Rise of Digital Repression’).</p>
<p>He also mentions Uganda, but I couldn’t quite concentrate enough to get all the details.</p>
<p>I don’t know if there will be any quasi-connections to what he talks about and what recently came out in the news in Uganda?</p>
<blockquote><p>

<p>Ugh</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Yay! My dad somehow got one of those too. It would be special on so many levels for so many people 🙂</p>
