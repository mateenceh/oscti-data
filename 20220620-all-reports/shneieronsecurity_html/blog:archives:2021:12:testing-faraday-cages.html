		<h2 class="entry">Testing Faraday Cages</h2>
		<p>Matt Blaze <a href="https://www.mattblaze.org/blog/faraday/">tested</a> a variety of Faraday cages for phones, both commercial and homemade.</p>
<p>The bottom line:</p>
<blockquote><p>A quick and likely reliable &#8220;go/no go test&#8221; can be done with an Apple AirTag and an iPhone: drop the AirTag in the bag under test, and see if the phone can locate it and activate its alarm (beware of caching in the FindMy app when doing this). </p>
<p>This test won&#8217;t tell you the exact attenuation level, of course, but it will tell you if the attenuation is sufficient for most practical purposes. It can also detect whether an otherwise good bag has been damaged and compromised. </p>
<p>At least in the frequency ranges I tested, two commercial Faraday pouches (the EDEC OffGrid and Mission Darkness Window pouches) yielded excellent performance sufficient to provide assurance of signal isolation under most real-world circumstances. None of the makeshift solutions consistently did nearly as well, although aluminum foil can, under ideal circumstances (that are difficult to replicate) sometimes provide comparable levels of attenuation.</p></blockquote>

				<p>&#8220;although aluminum foil can, under ideal circumstances (that are difficult to replicate) sometimes provide comparable levels of attenuation.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly true, but aluminum foil is easily obtained, can protect objects as large as you want, can be double folded to any desired thickness, and can be folded &#8220;air tight&#8221; if you make an effort. If you want it grounded, that is not that difficult to achieve (if you have a good ground, that is).</p>
<p>Yes, a $1000 special purpose Faraday Pouch is much better. But if that is not handy, go for aluminum foil.</p>

				<p>Aluminum foil works pretty good for blocking signals. High five!</p>
<p>I just tested it with my Apple AirTags, and voila… the Find My app says “Signal is weak. Try moving to a different location.” This was when I was about a foot away from the tags.</p>
<p>I had to turn my phone off and on and fold/crimp the foil around the tags to lose the signal. But if I ever want to hide my keys from myself, I will know exactly how to do it!!! Happy dance! 🙂</p>

				<p>Also, I didn’t ‘know’ that the AirTag can play play a sound. When the tag is wrapped in foil the sound won’t play. The app says “AirTag Not Reachable.”</p>
<p>However, when it’s not wrapped I could get the AirTag to play a sound from at least 30-40 feet.</p>

<p>Are you 100% sure? The third paragraph mentions that some software/malware could still support signal transmission even when the phone is ‘off.’ Matt says that non-removable batteries can compound these issues.</p>
<p>I’ve got extra aluminum foil if you need it😉</p>

<p>The &#8220;phone part&#8221; controls the computer part, not the other way round. You, as a user, cannot alter the phone related chips without a soldering iron. You can do that from the telecom side.</p>
<p>In practice, this means the phone part can switch the whole phone on and off without user intervention.</p>

<p>What about putting multiple layers of aluminum foil inside a box and even protect it with something hard like polycarbonate sheets to make it more resistant to multiple uses?</p>
<p>@ Alan</p>
<p>Indeed, turning off a phone makes it look it has 100% attenuation.  Reality is odd, however; you do not really &#8220;turn off&#8221; a smartphone these days, at least without removing the battery.</p>

				<p>Have we not been through this just a short while ago?</p>
<p>One reason aluminum foil is not as effective as it could be is &#8220;slot antennas&#8221; and &#8220;Fractal Antennas&#8221; as I&#8217;ve mentioned before.</p>
<p>In fact without care it is extraordinarily easy to turn a sheet of aluminum foil into a slot antenna.</p>
<p>To fold it at the edges you realy should &#8220;roll tightly then crush&#8221; rather than &#8220;fold and crimp&#8221;.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that whilst aluminium as a metal is a good conductor, it&#8217;s oxide which easily forms is infact one of the best electrical insulators we have (though it&#8217;s thermal conductivity is high). It&#8217;s frequently used in high power radio frequency equipment for device mounting.</p>
<p>Also whilst aluminium metal is very soft,aluminium oxide is very hard and very dificult to machine.</p>
<p>I actually use slugs of anodized aluminium inside silver plated coils to change their inductance as they can in some circumstances work better than ferrite materials (other metal oxides)</p>
<p>[1] Slot antennas traditionaly are the inverse of a dipole. That is a half wave length narrow slot in a sheet of metal with the feed being across the slot. However an infinately large sheet of metal is impractical so many slot antennas are cuts in boxes or cylinders that form cavity resonators,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/aperture/slot2.php" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/aperture/slot2.php</a></p>
<p>But not all slot antennas look like slots,</p>

<p>[2] Fractal antennas are wide band antennas and are still not at all well understood. Some can look like a piece of modern art made with car springs&#8230;</p>

				<p>@ Matt Blaze</p>
<p>[wrt 5G networks] &#8220;It is possible that the containers tested here perform similarly at those frequences, but it&#8217;s also possible that they would do much worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the contrary, I think they will perform much better.  One of the key points on the old Ricochet network at California was that it worked at 900 MHz.  At that low frequency, a single pole-top access point was able to reach a lot of places and pass through multiple walls.  A similar 5G-like setup would have required tens of access points placed everywhere.</p>

<p>It looks like Matt tested three commercial pouches and three makeshift pouches. The makeshift pouches were: 1) Electrostatic and Mylar Bags, 2) Metal Cookie Tin, and 3) Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil. Each had varying degrees of effectiveness.</p>
<p>It would be fun to try your experiment!</p>

&#8220;Not quite sure I follow. Could you explain more?&#8221;</p>
<p>A mobile phone consist of two computers. The part that connects to the cell tower and handles calls and messages and the part that acts like a user computer and installs the apps etc.</p>
<p>The part that controls the calls and the messaging works independently from the user computer part. It is a much simpler type of computer. But it also can control what the computer part does and read out its memory.</p>
<p>And the phone part is controlled from the cell tower.</p>

<p>Is this a good example of a fractal antenna?</p>

				<p>I would think you can test by calling the phone from another phone.  First verify reception by calling the unprotected phone.  If it rings, then protected with whatever method you choose and call it again.  If it doesn&#8217;t ring you have some protection?</p>

				<p>Can a cell phone be located when turned off?</p>
<p>Apple says iOS 15 can and does.  I believe this.</p>
<p>In 2013 the NSA said that it can track a phone that is turned off.  &#8220;allegedly&#8221; and &#8220;reportedly&#8221; have been used in all the articles I could find.  Some articles mentioned infecting target devices with malware.  This is now eight years ago.  Has this malware been found?  Does it have a name?  Has anybody else been able to reproduce these findings and publish results?  On modern hardware?  I found an article that made a mention of a Nextel phone.  That&#8217;s at least 16 years ago.</p>

				<p>@Who,</p>
<blockquote><p>
  One of the key points on the old Ricochet network at California was that it worked at 900 MHz. [..] A similar 5G-like setup would have required tens of access points placed everywhere.
</p></blockquote>
<p>No.</p>
<p>5G is frequency independent, it is designed to be used in multiple bands from 450MHz, 900Mhz all the way up to 27 Ghz. And there are people working on 66Ghz.</p>
<p>5G in the 900MHz band would have the same coverage area and the same in-building penetratoon as 2G in 900MHz.</p>
<p>The reason you don&#8217;t see 5G deployed in the 900Mz, especially in the US and Europe are all the vested interested who are submitting objections when operators file to close down 2G service because they have deployed IoT devices using the 900MHz band and don&#8217;t want to have to upgrade them.</p>
<p>When people talk about 5G densification that is because there is another requirement &#8211; number_of_users * average_data_usage and to meet that requirement you need higher frequency which in turn deives extra cell sites. John Donovan (the now retired AT&amp;T CTO) once said he had seen 475000% growth in mobile data which lead to some challenges in network engineering.</p>

				<p>@ Who?, Ted, Winter,</p>
<blockquote><p>What about putting multiple layers of aluminum foil inside a box and even protect it with something hard like polycarbonate sheets to make it more resistant to multiple uses?</p></blockquote>
<p>Ask yourself the question,</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does the energy go?&#8221;</p>
<p>If you think about it, &#8220;wave guide&#8221; is a box lined with metal, it very efficiently transports the energy from one end to the other.</p>
<p>Then think about a microwave oven, it is a metal box at the end of a short piece of waveguide with a magnetron at the other dumping between 0.5-1.5kW of power into the system.</p>
<p>They tell you quite rightly you should not use a microwave when it is empty, because there is nothing to absorb the EM energy and turn it into heat that will not just cook the food but let the excess energy escape as convected heat.</p>
<p>If you put a mobile phone in a metal lined box the EM energy will bounce around untill either it is absorbed or it escapes out of the box.</p>
<p>Most likely with aluminium foil it will escape via a &#8220;slot radiator&#8221; where the lid and body of the box join&#8230;</p>
<p>To stop this with microwave ovens they cheat, they turn the broad lip of the box into a transmission line when the door is closed. It becomes a shorted 1/4 line that just happens to reflect the energy back in opposition therefore looks like a very high impedence the same at the odd harmonics. However at the second harmonic it is now a shorted 1/2 wave at that looks like very nearly a short circuit as it does at the even harmonics.</p>
<p>All of which is greate at the single frequency the microwave oven is designed to work at.</p>
<p>However at other frequencies that transmission line will take the EM energy out to the door edge where it will be a &#8220;slot antenna&#8221; and it will radiate outwards quite effectively.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s what amused me about the Ed Snowden story and supposadly putting the journalists mobile phones in the microwave oven&#8230;</p>
<p>If it was me I would have put them in the freezer conpartment of the mini-bar and chatted about nonsense for half an hour or so to wait for the electronics and importantly the battery to get very cold. Though the thermal insulation inside a fridge, generally is very good at muffling sound which the metal walls of a microwave do not do anywhere near as well.</p>

<p>Fascinating. Which almost goes to show that one would really need to test everything. The unknown unknowns are the worst.</p>

				<p>@ Marc, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>Has this malware been found? Does it have a name? Has anybody else been able to reproduce these findings and publish results? On modern hardware?</p></blockquote>
<p>The answer to all your questions is effectively &#8220;Yes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Only what you are chosing to call &#8220;malware&#8221; is actually part of the underlying phone standards going back before mobile phones as you know them existed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve pointed this out several times over the years on this blog, and for some reason it keeps getting asked&#8230;</p>
<p>Officially it&#8217;s there under the old rouse of &#8220;Health and Safety&#8221; that various Five-Eye members on the standards committees have used to &#8220;finesse&#8221; it in. It goes back to long prior to WWII and is a side effect of &#8220;Operator Breakin&#8221; on the ancient &#8220;Plain Old Telephone System&#8221;(POTS) that you might call a &#8220;land line&#8221;.</p>
<p>During the Cold War the UK developed a little device it could put into a POTS pair, it was based on an RF Noise bridge. What you did was squirt an RF signal around the Medium Wave frequencies into the bridge. It in turn would send it down the telephone pair which was effectively a &#8220;transmission line&#8221; where it would see a complex load of the hook switch capacitence and variable resistance of the carbon granual microphone (later variable inductance). This complex load would reflect back the energy but modulated by the impedence change of the microphone. The RF bridge enabled this to be recovered as an Amplitude Modulated signal in a simple diode detector, giving very clear audio&#8230;</p>
<p>If you read the first half of Peter Writes 1980&#8217;s book &#8220;Spy catcher&#8221; you will not only find the device described but be told how it was used to bug various Embassies in London. In one case &#8211;Egypt&#8211; apparently they had a phone line in their &#8220;CryptoCell&#8221; adjacent to their &#8220;CommCen&#8221;. Back then they were using Crypto Kit from a well known Swiss Crypto Company secretly owned by the US. Being electro-mechanical not only dis they generate EM signals they generated audio signals that leaked the wheel settings way way better. The result GCHQ knew the key settings almost before the first message of the day had bern encrypted&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why in the UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher banned the use of mobile phones in confidential or above meetings/briefings and would not alow mobile phones to be brought anywere close to crypto equipment. Because she knew there ws another trick that could be used with mobile phones.</p>
<p>A mobile phone is an RF generator and receiver. If RF gets into sensitive electronics it can,</p>
<p>1, Be cross modulated by the electronics pulling out secret information.</p>
<p>2, It can cause timing errors in computer circuits enabaling you to inject faults benificial to your activities.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned before I independently discovered all of this and more in the early 1980&#8217;s as I now know did several other engineers.</p>
<p>The thing is for something that is not in anyway secret these days, just how very very few know about it.</p>
<p>Worse when the Uni in Israel demonstrates upto date systems doing it wirh less than $50 of &#8220;Software Defined Radio&#8221;(SDR) people still do not appear to get it.</p>
<p>Likewise when it&#8217;s demonstrated by university students that you can use WiFi signals in people homes to not just see people move from room to room but see their hand movments as well such as typing at a keyboard people still do not get it&#8230;</p>
<p>I could go on wirh a very very long list of these &#8220;don&#8217;t get it&#8221; items, certainly enough to fill over a hundred pages of text&#8230;</p>
<p>But hey, most peoples ignorence is another man&#8217;s income&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Which almost goes to show that one would really need to test everything.</p></blockquote>
<p>Importantly &#8220;at all frequencies&#8221; not just a tiny number of &#8220;spot frequencies&#8221;.</p>
<p>One of the reasons EMC test houses use prober spectrum analysers is that they contain &#8220;tracking generators&#8221; that make such all frequency testing relatively painless.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s something I do from time to time and I&#8217;ve access to a proper test TEM Cell / RF anechoic chamber that is about the size of a &#8220;white van&#8221; of the Ford Transit variety.</p>
<p>I also have a walk in Faraday Sheilded &#8220;cage&#8221; that is also anechoicaly lined (quit cosy in the winter, stinking hot in the summer).</p>

<blockquote><p>Is this a good example of a fractal antenna?</p></blockquote>
<p>There are &#8220;fractal antennas&#8221; that look like that &#8220;decoration&#8221;. In fact one of the first demonstrated did look very similar.</p>
<p>However you would have to test it to know for sure.</p>
<p>But my keen eye suggests it is &#8220;unlikely&#8221; to be an effective &#8220;fractal antenna&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Why, because it&#8217;s not actually a fractal as such. If you look at the &#8220;limbs&#8221; you will see the wires are not parallel but taper being quite wide in the center and quite fine towards the tip. Kind of like the outline of a star. This would probably not provide a very good impedence against frequency profile.</p>
<p>Hence the need to test.</p>

<p>Well actually you do not want it,</p>

2, Have any gaps.</p>
<p>Whilst you could use a metal bin / trash can for the first requirment.</p>
<p>The second kind of means not so much the shaving of hair, but the need to  cut off the head at the neck. Which lets be honest could be,</p>
<p>1, Counter productive.<br />
2, Distinctly messy.</p>

				<p>This is a topic about which there is no shortage of misinformation.</p>
<p>First there are a lot of people who want to appear knowledgeable.  More than that they want to believe themselves knowledgeable.  They want to believe that they are in control of the situation, so they believe that the things they have come up with will work.</p>
<p>Second, there is moderate difficulty in testing claims.  Not severe difficulty, but sufficient to mean that claims made without testing evidence are usually unchallenged.  And, people usually don&#8217;t test their own &#8220;home remedies&#8221; either, partly because they prefer not to learn that they aren&#8217;t (yet) in control of the situation.</p>
<p>Third, there are a lot of people who want the first set of people to believe bullshit, who will do absolutely nothing to discourage the spread of such bullshit when it naturally arises, and who may or may not even wait for it to naturally arise.</p>
<p>You can see how these three things interact.</p>
<p>I once believed in cookie tins.  You know the metal containers with the tight-fitting metal lids that certain types of cookies (often marketed as &#8220;Danish&#8221; cookies) come in?  It seems like a good bet, doesn&#8217;t it?  Then I actually tested them.  That was disappointing.</p>
<p>A few hours later, after roughing the joint along the bottom of the tin with steel wool and then laying down a bead of solder all the way around it, putting a layer of tinfoil over the tin before pushing the lid on, wrapping it in bubble wrap to keep it from making electrical contact, and sticking that bundle inside a second, larger, similarly-treated cookie tin, I finally managed, as completely as I could tell with my testing equipment anyhow, to completely shut up the radio noise.</p>
<p>A cookie tin, by itself, can attenuate radio signal a lot. But on a different frequency, or with a different tin, or even just a different time the lid gets closed, it doesn&#8217;t.  I thought it was way more reliable.  I was wrong.</p>
