				<p>It remains to be seen if the structures they found are actually cephalopods.</p>
<p>Classical (as opposed to molecular) phylogeny on cephalopods is problematic- their tissues tend to self destruct on death, even more than you&#8217;d expect for a soft-bodied organism.</p>
<p>PBS Eons discusses the issues involved, in S3E45, titled &#8220;Where Are All The Squid Fossils?&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8212; Intel fails to get Spectre, Meltdown chip flaw class-action super-suit tossed out</p>
<p>&#8220;Intel will have to defend itself against claims that the semiconductor goliath <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/28/intel_spectre_lawsuit/" rel="nofollow ugc">knew its microprocessors were defective and failed to tell customers.</a></p>
<p>On Wednesday, Judge Michael Simon, of the US District Court of Oregon, partially denied the tech giant&#8217;s motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit arising from the 2018 public disclosure of Meltdown and Spectre, the family of data-leaking chip microarchitecture design blunders.</p>
<p>The Register broke the Meltdown story on January 2, 2018, as Intel and those who confidentially reported the security vulnerabilities were preparing to disclose them. The following day, Google&#8217;s Project Zero published details of Meltdown and its cousin Spectre, revealing that efforts to make CPU cores faster using speculative execution have opened them up to side-channel attacks that can read memory that should be out of reach and leak confidential information.</p>
<p>To defend against Meltdown and Spectre, Intel and other affected vendors have had to add software and hardware mitigations that for some workloads make patched processors mildly to significantly slower.&#8221;</p>

				<p>Bruce, any thoughts on this article?</p>
<p>Cause of Cambrian Explosion &#8211; Terrestrial or Cosmic?</p>
<p>Abstract<br />
We review the salient evidence consistent with or predicted by the Hoyle-Wickramasinghe (H-W) thesis of Cometary (Cosmic) Biology. Much of this physical and biological evidence is multifactorial. One particular focus are the recent studies which date the emergence of the complex retroviruses of vertebrate lines at or just before the Cambrian Explosion of ∼500 Ma. Such viruses are known to be plausibly associated with major evolutionary genomic processes. We believe this coincidence is not fortuitous but is consistent with a key prediction of H-W theory whereby major extinction-diversification evolutionary boundaries coincide with virus-bearing cometary-bolide bombardment events. A second focus is the remarkable evolution of intelligent complexity (Cephalopods) culminating in the emergence of the Octopus. A third focus concerns the micro-organism fossil evidence contained within meteorites as well as the detection in the upper atmosphere of apparent incoming life-bearing particles from space. In our view the totality of the multifactorial data and critical analyses assembled by Fred Hoyle, Chandra Wickramasinghe and their many colleagues since the 1960s leads to a very plausible conclusion – life may have been seeded here on Earth by life-bearing comets as soon as conditions on Earth allowed it to flourish (about or just before 4.1 Billion years ago); and living organisms such as space-resistant and space-hardy bacteria, viruses, more complex eukaryotic cells, fertilised ova and seeds have been continuously delivered ever since to Earth so being one important driver of further terrestrial evolution which has resulted in considerable genetic diversity and which has led to the emergence of mankind.</p>

				<p>Zelenskiy (&#8230;) appeared to disagree with the Biden administration’s bleak assessment that a Russian attack next month was “distinctly possible”.<br />
(&#8230;) We do understand what is happening. But we have been in the situation for eight years. (&#8230;) he said. “The threat is constant.”</p>
<p>Zelenskiy said the recent buildup of Kremlin forces was “no more intense” than in spring 2021. “If you look at the satellite you will see the increase of troops. You can’t assess if it’s a threat, an attack or simple rotation,” he said, adding that some of the tents for Russian soldiers appeared to be empty.</p>
<p>Moscow moved in additional troops before major diplomatic negotiations, he said. “It’s psychological. They want to make believe they are there. They are trying to build up psychological pressure.”</p>

				<p>This paper (H&gt;T&gt;T&gt;P&gt;S://people.csail.mit.edu/henrycg/pubs/oakland15riposte/) sounds remarkably promising, at least until you read the fine print.</p>
<p>The sales pitch on the tin is that the authors have found a way to make fleet broadcast scalable into the millions-of-users range.</p>
<p>Fine print:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guarantees anonymous writing, but not anonymous reading</li>
<li>The authors actually propose two different versions:
<ul>
<li>The 3-server version is scalable to millions of users, but requires that no 2 servers collude. That&#8217;s a rather unrealistic requirement given a threat model that already calls for fleet broadcast.</li>
<li>The n-server version can tolerate n-1 malicious servers, but doesn&#8217;t scale worth beans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So close, and yet so far&#8230;</p>

&#8220;Moscow moved in additional troops before major diplomatic negotiations, he said. “It’s psychological. They want to make believe they are there. They are trying to build up psychological pressure.”&#8221;</p>
<p>About Putin&#8217;s intentions, look back to 2008, the Russo Georgian war:<br />
ht-tps://euromaidanpress.com/2014/08/08/how-the-russo-georgian-war-of-2008-started/</p>
<blockquote><p>
From 15 July to 2 August 2008, Russia conducted a large-scale military exercise, Kavkaz 2008, near Georgia’s borders.  During that exercise, participants were given a leaflet entitled “Soldier! Know Your Enemy!”, with the description of the Georgian armed forces.  After the end of that exercise, the participating military units were not withdrawn;  they remained on Georgia’s borders poised for action. Elements of these units crossed the border prior to the launch of combat operations by Georgian servicemen, whilst the remaining units did so thereafter.</p>
<p>Russia also initiated political preparations for their action against Georgia.  On 14 February 2008, President Vladimir Putin declared that in the event of international recognition of the independence of Kosovo, Russia had action plans ready.  On 17 February, Kosovo declared its independence, which was recognized by many states over the following days.  Soon after it became clear what Putin’s plans were.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Or 2014, for that matter, involving the Crimea and Donbass.</p>

<blockquote><p>
As masked commandos in similar garb fanned out across the peninsula over the next two weeks, surrounding Ukrainian military bases and taking control of other strategic facilities, it was clear to many on the ground that they were Russian military. One of the soldiers said as much on camera.</p>
<p>But despite clear indications that Moscow had dispatched these forces &#8212; or &#8220;little green men,&#8221; as they came to be widely known &#8212; Russia embarked on a campaign of denials and obfuscations about their provenance and role in helping cement Moscow&#8217;s annexation of Crimea in March 2014.</p>
<p>Russia described them as &#8220;self-defense units&#8221; created by locals concerned about alleged threats against Crimea&#8217;s Russian-speaking population from Ukrainian ultranationalists.

<p>Putin, who previously said the troops were part of local self-defence forces, said the Russian soldiers&#8217; presence was necessary to protect the local population from armed radicals and to ensure the holding of a referendum, in which an overwhelming majority of its residents voted for seceding from Ukraine and joining Russia.

				<p>Microsoft says that Windows devices need to be online for at least eight hours to get the latest updates and have them correctly installed after they&#8217;re released through Windows Update.[1]</p>
<p>The amount of time devices running Windows are powered on and connected to Windows Update is tracked by Microsoft as &#8216;Update Connectivity.&#8217;</p>
<p>This measurement correlates the systems&#8217; lack of enough connected time with why they&#8217;re not up to date while also making it easier to understand why some devices are unlikely to get recently released updates successfully.</p>
<p>According to David Guyer, a Microsoft Program Manager for Windows Updates in MEM, Windows devices need at least 8 hours online to get the latest updates and successfully install them.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most impactful things we explored was how much time a device needs to be powered on and connected to Windows Update to be able to successfully install quality and feature updates,&#8221; said Guyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we found is that devices that don&#8217;t meet a certain amount of connected time are very unlikely to successfully update. Specifically, data shows that devices need a minimum of two continuous connected hours, and six total connected hours after an update is released to reliably update.</p>
<p>&#8220;This allows for a successful download and background installations that are able to restart or resume once a device is active and connected.&#8221;</p>

Project Theseus is examining how machines could reduce the need for people to risk their lives to deliver ammunition, clothes, food and fuel.<br />
Three companies have each been given £3m contracts to investigate the use of autonomous systems, including robots.<br />
The Ministry Of Defense (MOD) procurement arm in Bristol said the plan would allow troops to use an &#8220;Amazon-style delivery service&#8221;.</p>
<p>The robots will have the ability to operate themselves in the air or on the ground.<br />
This first phase of the project will also explore the use of robotic dogs to support !!!!troops in dangerous and complex urban environments.</p>
<p>Companies Horiba Mira UK, Marlborough Comms Ltd UK and Rafael Israel were awarded the contracts by the procurement arm of the Ministry of Defense in Abbey Wood in Bristol.&#8221;=</p>

<p>When Szabolcs Panyi learned, in the spring of 2021, that the Pegasus spy software had been installed on his smartphone, the Hungarian investigative journalist knew it wasn&#8217;t just a case of eavesdropping. The software does more than simply intercept phone calls: It can access all of a smartphone&#8217;s data, and can even switch on the microphone and camera without being noticed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt as if they had broken into my apartment and office, bugged everything, put hidden cameras everywhere, and were even following me into the shower,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the one hand, we want those affected to be told what information and data the intelligence services have on them,&#8221; HCLU lawyer Adam Remport, who is coordinating the initiative, told DW. &#8220;On the other hand, we want to take action against abusive surveillance in general, and obtain better and independent controls over intelligence services in Hungary.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Israel, attorney Eitay Mack will file a lawsuit with the country&#8217;s attorney general against both the manufacturer of the software, a private technology company called NSO Group, and the Israeli Defense Ministry, which has to approve sales of such software to other countries. Mack has already made several attempts to sue over Pegasus — because of the way the software was used in Mexico, among other things — so far, however, without success.=</p>

				<p>@Winter, @MarkH, @Clive, @All</p>
<p>Reports are that Poland is stringing concertina wire along the borders of Belarus.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit like Trump&#8217;s wall, except it uses razor wire and cuts through regional cultural heritage forests, instead of steel bar girders running through regional cultural heritage desert. That keeps the Polish Wire Wall on a &#8220;greener foot print&#8221;.</p>
<p>The purported reason is to stop unwanted immigration into the EU. It&#8217;s also handy way to stop any civilians that might want to leave the area.</p>
<p>If the Poland-Belarus border is locked to transit, that leaves not many options unless you can swim the Black Sea to Turkey.</p>
<p>After Ukraine, y&#8217;all can untangle Catalonia &amp; Spain.</p>
<p>There are some great lines spoken by EU Politicians. Even if the speakers are disingenuous, the speech writers are very good.</p>
<blockquote><p>
“What are borders? They are the scars that historia has left engraved on the world, engraved with blood and fire, let’s not raise more, because they have cost a lot to build.” </p>

<p>You realise that the majority of the French know &#8220;Macaroon&#8221; is an idiot who knows very little and listens to the wrong people and does the wrong thing, so want to get rid of him?</p>
<p>Are you aware that the US State Dept see &#8220;Macaroon&#8221; as an ideal way to greate division in Europe and thus hasten it&#8217;s weakening.</p>
<p>Likewise Biden sees disention between France and Germany as a way to further his undesirable aims for Europe.</p>
<p>There is a reason why &#8220;Macaroon&#8221; is at odds with Brussels and why the next six months of France holding the EU Presidency is seen as a golden opportunity to damage Europe both politically and Economically.</p>
<p>As a rough rule of thumb every time &#8220;Macaroon&#8221; spouts off it&#8217;s best to consider it at best bad news, if not a whole lot worse.</p>
<p>You appear to have very little knowledge of the world and the way it works especially the Rus, so unless you want people to think you to are a &#8220;Macaroon&#8221; you start studying a little European History.</p>

Is this for real?? You need at least to be 8 hours up for being infected before getting an update? It&#8217;s just like saying you only get a COVID shot after 8 hours traveling on the subway licking all the handles. Maybe Melinda Foundation should also spend some money sanitizing our digital life :P.</p>

				<p>@ MarkH, Winter,</p>
<blockquote><p>Mighty realistic exercises!</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in the 1980&#8217;s the CCCP used to hold military excercises where they used real chemical weapons and accepted a 1/8th (12.5%) casualty rate as acceptable price to pay.</p>
<p>Putin&#8217;s age and KGB inteligence  background from 75-90 would suggest that he would have trained to been part of such excercises, and it&#8217;s likely it would have been at local directing officer level or higher&#8230;</p>
<p>So consider &#8220;old dogs&#8221; tend to favour the tricks they learnt when young. Especially if they are an authoritarian in a possition of power.</p>

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing, Winter, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>Reports are that Poland is stringing concertina wire along the borders of Belarus.</p></blockquote>
<p>Depending on your point of view,</p>
<p>1, About time to.<br />
2, Why did it take,so long.</p>
<p>The advantage of such a boarder marker is it&#8217;s fairly clear when you can shoot them for being the wrong side of the boarder.</p>
<p>Whilst the citizens of Belarus (White Russian) are like most people, just want to get on with their lives, they can not.</p>
<p>Their country is run by crooked politicians who are effectively led by a dictator and supported by both criminals and a Russian authoritarian and his guard labour.</p>
<p>Photo reconnaissance that has been made public clearly shows a military build up along the Belarus-Ukrain boarder and this indicators are it is Russian in origin, or certainly using Russian equipment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing that Poland being a NATO country with NATO troops on the ground are trying to discorage not civilians but millitary.</p>
<p>Whilst the UK has given some support to the UK, there are suggestions that bith the US and EU are at best dragging their heals over treaty agreements with the Ukraine.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve indicated before Putin could easily invade the Ukraine and occuping the East where there are 10million or so Rus would not be much of an issue for him. However as for West of Kiev I think even Putin knows that whilst he could invade it, he could not hold it and it would become for the Russians another Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Russia has a problem, it&#8217;s economy is based on exporting oil and gas and is thus not one that is going to last. For several hundred years Russian has been a parasite effectively living off of a heavily subjugated Empire, an Empire it nolonger has. Putin has two options,</p>
<p>1, Strong Russia no sustainable economy.<br />
2, Russia without influance but with a sustainable economy.</p>
<p>The first keeps him in power due to Rus myths but will loose him elections due to the economy failing.</p>
<p>The second won&#8217;t keep him in power as he&#8217;s built his entire political career on On the notion of &#8220;Strong Russia&#8221; to cover up his authoritarian nature.</p>
<p>So Putins game is to,</p>
<p>1, Appear like &#8220;Strong Russia&#8221;.<br />
2, Have an enemy to blaim the failing economy on.</p>
<p>A big thorn in his side is Belarus, it had a taste of not just freedom but an improving economy. Putin did not like the &#8220;freedom&#8221; asspect so he is responsible for the authoritarian regime Belarus now has, and in the process it resulted in a destroyed economy.</p>
<p>So if the Rus care to look beyond the sentimentality for faux history Putin is pushing like crazy, they will see what his authoritarianism will do to the Russian economy in the long term, the story has been written in Belarus&#8230;</p>
<p>So Putin needs to win a very limited war to show &#8220;Strong Russia&#8221; to the home audiance but also not have the cost of pacifing Western Ukrain. But importantly an enemy to blaim for the fact the Russian economy is spiralling down due to,</p>
<p>1, Ineffective petro-chem economy.<br />
2, Sanctions.</p>
<p>If Putin brings down the Ukrainian Economy, the Rus in Russia will increasingly see that his authoritarianism will destroy their hopes for a sustainable Russian economy&#8230;</p>
<p>But Putin is going to need a string of &#8220;Strong Russia&#8221; victories over the next few years so he has to take little conquest steps, so salami slicing attacks will give him not just one victory for his home audiance but repeated victories over time, as well as an excuse to keep a huge standing army that the Russian economy can not aford.</p>

<blockquote><p>The civilized way is not about who does it, but how to do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I said you realy need to study European history.</p>
<p>Putin is authoritarian which makes him both a bully and a coward.</p>
<p>History shows that trying to appease such people does not work.</p>
<p>The way to deal with a plaground bully is not to hide, or hand over your dinner money, but give him either or both a good punch on the nose, a hard kick between the legs.</p>
<p>Yes he may well fight back at the time, but he is, in the future going to pick on other people.</p>
<p>We already know the likely outcome to the Ukrainian people if we don&#8217;t act. We just have to look at Belarus.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time you actually got down to doing a little learning instead of following an appeasement policy that will fail and cost more and more as time goes on[1].</p>
<p>In short standing at an airport waving a piece of paper and saying &#8220;Peace in our time&#8221; will give rise to a major war in short order.</p>
<p>So what you are proposing is in reality going to give rise to an all out war in Europe which will drag the rest of the world in for the third time.</p>
<p>[1] It&#8217;s the same reason why you do not pay Danegelt, or hostage takers. Because it only encorages them to carry on and ask for more. The way to deal with hostage takers is &#8220;Hound them down and crucify them&#8221; so that others get the idea being a hostage taker has no future in it.</p>

				<p>@ Clive, JonKnowsNothing, Winter, ALL</p>
<p>I think this is why Putin stole back the REvil profits.  He had to dig up the scratch so fast to pay his troops, to prevent an internal coup.</p>
<p>That is how much Russia is broke.</p>
<p>Putin is looking for an out.  To save face.  If he buys a vowel, and changes his attitude, he could actually get some help from US and EU.  He could actually show some leadership, and actually help his citizens, who are getting hit with Covid hard now.</p>
<p>Putin is the rat that jumped into the Pickle Bucket.  He is spinning around, looking for a way out.  He knows he needs help.</p>
<p>He is hoping that the US throws him a concession bone, so he can back out politically and save face.</p>
<p>It is there, but Putin must change his attitude.  And internal policies.</p>
<p>If he does not, the actions wiil be SWIFT.</p>
<p>Putin must show a concession on his part first.  He needs to wake up and start being a responsible leader.</p>
<p>Will he?  I do not know.  But he should.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Once again, it is demonstrated that the failure of the government to produce a uniform, expert report only causes further controversy rather than resolution.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>So the CIA is comfortable with this &#8220;interim report&#8221;?</em></p>
<p>“If you have an inconclusive determination, which isn’t a determination, why do you feel compelled to issue an interim report that is inconclusive?”<br />

<p><em>The late M. de Gournay&#8230; sometimes used to say: &#8220;We have an illness in France which bids fair to play havoc with us; this illness is called bureaumania.&#8221; Sometimes he used to invent a fourth or fifth form of government under the heading of &#8220;bureaucracy.&#8221;</em> — Baron von Grimm</p>
<p>many of the affected personnel are outraged or upset by the CIA&#8217;s assessment, with some like Marc Polymeropoulos, a retired CIA agent who was affected while on assignment in Moscow, fearing they will not be believed or will be &#8220;mocked and vilified.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remain grateful of the health care that Director Burns has agreed to provide for those who have been impacted, but now victims are being shamed and mocked,&#8221; Polymeropoulos said, calling it &#8220;a return to the early days of Havana where officers were not believed.&#8221;<br />

<p>The previously classified report, which was completed in June 2018, is at times heavily redacted, but it provides new key details about the Trump administration&#8217;s response to what have been called &#8220;health attacks&#8221; on diplomats and spies, including similar incidents in other countries, and the CIA&#8217;s decision to shut down its mission in Havana.<br />

<p>&#8220;The National Security Agency confirms there is intelligence information from 2012 associating the hostile country to which Mr. Beck traveled in the late 1990s with a high powered microwave system weapon that may have the ability to weaken, intimidate or kill an enemy over time and without leaving evidence,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This weapon is designed to target the living quarters in microwaves, causing numerous physical effects, including a damaged nervous system,&#8221; the letter added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we have an unclassified document from a U.S. intelligence agency admitting it knows of this before Havana,&#8221; Zaid said.<br />

<p>Though couched in careful, scientific language, the new report reveals strong evidence that the incidents were the result of a malicious attack. It attributes the illnesses to “directed” and “pulsed” — rather than “continuous” — energy, implying that the victims’ exposure was targeted and not the result of more common sources of microwave energy.<br />

<p>The revelation that CIA agents were targeted by a sophisticated microwave weapon while in Australia* last year proves such devices are real, a security expert said.<br />

<p>&#8230;because it would look a little odd if it turned out the CIA, and it&#8217;s *partners, did have evidence and quite happily buried it for decades.</p>
<p>As long as we have the technology and we have the knowledge, what does a hundred or so lives matter? After all these people volunteered their lives to protect and safe guard others, and by effect, so did their children, neighbors and families.</p>
<p><em>But wait a minute&#8230;</em></p>
<p>&#8230;the door was left open, just in case boxes of paperwork were misplaced, it does happen, destroying evidence is a crime after all.</p>
<p>Two administrations just can&#8217;t find the paperwork, along with several before them. I suppose we can always repeat the last time, the timing after all, just like the last time is horribly inconvenient.</p>

				<p>Attribution</p>
<p>Private Sector Attribution of Cyber Incidents:<br />
Benefits and Risks to the U.S. Government</p>
<p>An emerging concern regarding attribution relates to individual privacy and safety. In this Article, we touched briefly on potential risks that employees of threat intelligence firms face when conducting their investigations into APT activities. And at least one of the managers we interviewed would frequently check with their employees about concerns over travelling abroad because of their work.</p>
<p>Cylance writes, “[w]e believe that if the operation is left to continue unabated, it is only a matter of time before the world’s physical safety is impacted by it. While the disclosure of this information will be a detriment to our ability to track the activity of this group, it will allow the security industry as a whole to defend against this threat. As such, we are exposing this cyber campaign early in an attempt to minimize additional real-world impact and prevent further victimization”<br />

				<p>The Cassandra Complex</p>
<p>If a ‘PCAP’ is considered the ultimate measure of attack fidelity, then what entity is more supremely positioned to perform attribution than the modern SIGINT agencies?</p>
<p>These ‘gods of the wires’ are positioned in such a way as to enact near perfect recall when an attack is discovered, either by snooping on the wires or having ‘popped’ the routers in a country of interest. In true Greek irony, the Cassandras of the modern age are hamstrung by their own Apollonian curse: as intelligence agencies they are blessed with the ability to see but not to publicly substantiate, the gift to attribute without being believed.<br />

				<p>@ ResearcherZero, ALL,</p>
<p>With regards,</p>
<blockquote><p>HPM are a form of directed energy weaponry which are capable of disrupting or even destroying electronics inside of drones or weapon systems, literally frying their circuitry from the inside out when powerful enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually they are in a sub class of &#8220;Directed Energy Weapons&#8221;(DEWs) generaly called &#8220;High Energy Radio Frequency&#8221;(HERF) devices.</p>
<p>You can easily make one at home from a microwave oven, and it would be a &#8220;Carrier/continuous Wave&#8221;(CW) system implting it is in effect unmodulated.</p>
<p>The simplest way to modulate it would be by turning the anode supply to the magnetron on and off. A hundred years ago they CW modulated early tube/valves &#8220;power oscillators&#8221; by puting a morse key in the cathode to ground connection as a way that was &#8220;safer&#8221; to do. You will still find &#8220;straight keys&#8221; that are encased in grounded metal cases in military surplus dating back from post WWII up untill as late as the 1990&#8217;s. The grounding was not just for &#8220;safety&#8221; but also to reduce the fact that the arc/spark being &#8220;DC&#8221; rather than &#8220;RF&#8221; was an &#8220;unitentional emmissions&#8221; issue so fell under TEMPEST &#8220;box bashing and filtering rules&#8221;.</p>
<p>For higher &#8220;Pulse Repetition Frequencies&#8221;(PRF) you can use a &#8220;slotted disk&#8221; switch driven by a geared electric motor and variations on these were used in the very early days of radio experimentation. Imagine a metal disk that spins, not that unlike a cutting disk on a powered woodsaw or similar tool. The large teath make the blades in a &#8220;knife switch&#8221; arangment and you get a series of &#8220;shaped&#8221; regular pulses. That is the ratio between the width of the blade and the adjacent gap enabled a cyclic &#8220;Pulse Width Modulation&#8221;(PWM).</p>
<p>However such modulation is very limited in capability with mechanical switches. The world of &#8220;Switch Mode Power Supplies&#8221;(SMPS) exists an Class D, Class E and even Class F systems are used, I also used a combination of Class E and Class H to build a &#8220;High Effiency Digitally Modulated AM&#8221; transmitter prototype quite a few years back. Because the usual Class A &#8220;plate modulation&#8221; systems were less than 50% efficient at the best of times, and Class C power stages maybe 75% if you pushed them.</p>
<p>There are a number of Amateur Radio articles on &#8220;analogue&#8221; modulation of microwave oven magnatrons for quater to half killowatt transmiters at 13cms Amature band (just below the 2.5GHz ISM band most microwave overns work at). Some use &#8220;Amplitude Modulation&#8221;(AM) and some &#8220;Frequency Modulation&#8221;(FM) unfortunately magnatrons have funny charecteristics and you usually get both if you use powersupply modulation.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can if you are any good at metalwork make a folded horn antenna and waveguide from a microwave oven along with a &#8220;pure sinewave power inverter&#8221; to drive the oven power supply and suitible LiPo batteries make a man portable half kilowatt 13cm Amature Radio Transmitter that fits easily in a 35ltr &#8220;Day Sack&#8221; backpack. I know because I&#8217;ve built a couple in the past for doing the experimentation part of the Amateur Radio hobby, and yes you have to take care, I did hang a hotdog sausage on a bit of monofiliment line and dangle it in the &#8220;antenna boresight&#8221; and heat it up quite successfully&#8230;</p>
<p>The difference between such a transmitter and a &#8220;HERF Gun&#8221; is very small. There used to be You-Tube videos of home made HERF guns, but as they mostly got the antennas and feed systems wrong the range to destroy electronics was just a few meters.</p>
<p>But a quick look this morning, gives,</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm9PM6qrV9M" rel="nofollow ugc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm9PM6qrV9M</a></p>
<p>Where you can see one somebody was invited to make for a &#8220;Science Fair&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>To say &#8220;I squeamed&#8221; when I saw him put his hand infront of the antenna is a bit of an understatment. But he achived his objective &#8220;to cook off the Smoked Pig&#8221;&#8230;</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<blockquote><p>I guess this could be considered progress</p></blockquote>
<p>As can any move in a game of chess progress the game towards it&#8217;s conclusion. But at the end of the day feints do win more games than most realise&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh with regards the &#8220;currency round up&#8221; paying people deployed in fields would not have been the primary concern.</p>
<p>As the EU has discovered to their considerable anoyance they have to print money to keep enough in circulation to keep the economy bouyant.</p>
<p>This is because criminals are &#8220;shrink wrapping&#8221; millions of high value Euro notes onto pallets and sticking them in warehouses as &#8220;pocket change / petty cash&#8221; in their money laundering. The &#8220;black economy is the unknown country&#8221; not on the European flag, and it has no political aliance but one heck of an effect on all the other EU countries economies.</p>
<p>However the problem with printing money is it creates inflation which can be both desirable and undesirable depending on your aims and objectives. For instance as people are finding out in the US &#8220;Printing money&#8221; has raised prices in the shops and made college funds, pension pots and savings worth quite a bit less. However to those that quickly turn it into assets such as the 1% of the one percenters that own over half the wealth of the US and other areas of the world it&#8217;s been a bonus time, which is why the price of property rose apparently inexplicably to many. Which will create a property crisis a little way down the road with the price of rents going up significantly bringing in large &#8220;rent seaking income&#8221; for the chosen few&#8230;</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s economy is on a bit of a donwards slope currently, even though the price of gas is rising, the reasons are complicated but the economy is both fragile and skittish&#8230; So a shortage in the currency supply can very very easily turn into a &#8220;run on the banks&#8221; and others putting &#8220;money under the matress&#8221; creating a downward spiral and artificial inflation due to panic buying etc and all the knock on effects of that.</p>
<p>So what Russia does not want to do is &#8220;Print Money&#8221; to cover what is going into storage of organised crime&#8230; It want&#8217;s that &#8220;cash back in circulation creating economic churn&#8221; and making people feel happy, thus spend and make the ecobomic wheel spin up, creating demand, thus hopefulky jobs and all those other things politicians see as good.</p>
<p>Paying soldiers deployed in the field cash, is a bit pointless from this perspective, they have nowhere to spend it so it would not create economic churn to keep the economy buoyant.</p>

<p>The Rand paper is deficient from the extract onwards as it fsils to consider,</p>

<p>USG Politicos and off record spokes persons with agenders have had a habit of &#8220;burning&#8221; the &#8220;Methods and Sources&#8221; of alied countries.</p>
<p>If they show such lack of concern for the citizens and associates of their alied nations, how much concern do you think they would have for US Citizens involved in what is inteligence analysis?</p>

				<p>@somebody re: id.me &amp; IRS &#8211; Mark started a thread on this on last week&#8217;s Squid. I have since seen some reports that US Treasury is investigating the requirement, possibly as the result of considerable hue and cry over it amongst orivacy advocates and (at least a few) ITSec pros. So possibly Blake Hall&#8217;s bribery will go for naught. Here&#8217;s hoping&#8230;</p>

<p>It does not matter what Meta and WhatsApp marketing say.</p>
<p>The crooks have no understanding of Metadata.</p>
<p>Meta will reveal that Crook1 and Crook2 are communicating even if the comm is encrypted, given a warrant or NSL.</p>
<p>If they are high level subjects of interest, then via other methods, the investigation will find more intel.</p>
<p>See Pegasus.</p>
<p>Also, re-check the thread you linked to, and see the followup comments.  Give it some more hours to age properly, like a fine wine.</p>

<p>The UN PETs Lab, which opened for business officially on January 25th, enables national statistics offices, academic researchers and companies to collaborate to carry out projects which will test various PETs, permitting technical and administrative hiccups to be identified and overcome.</p>
<p>The first such effort, which actually began last summer, before the PETs Lab’s formal inauguration, analysed import and export data from national statistical offices in America, Britain, Canada, Italy and the Netherlands, to look for anomalies. Those could be a result of fraud, of faulty record keeping or of innocuous re-exporting.</p>
<p>They put several kinds of PETs through their paces. In one trial, OpenMined, a charity based in Oxford, tested a technique called secure multiparty computation (SMPC). This approach involves the data to be analysed being encrypted by their keeper and staying on the premises. The organisation running the analysis (in this case OpenMined) sends its algorithm to the keeper, who runs it on the encrypted data.</p>

				<p>Bug Bounty, Windows, Reverse Enginerring</p>
<p>If you have to use Windows (sorry), you need to apply the patches, because they will be reverse engineered quickly.</p>
<p><b>Bug bounty does not work when the fixes are held back and the exploit is being weaponised.</b></p>
<p>As I said before when you find a bug:</p>
<p>Open source?  &#8211; provide report and/or patch.</p>
<p>Closed source? &#8211; Leak it.</p>
<p><b>They will not publicly fix bugs if in fact they are being weaponised.</b></p>
<p>You need to get them to respond.</p>
<p>Like a stubborn mule, you need to whack them upside the head.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Security researcher @_arkon says he also discovered the bug two years ago and did not disclose it due to the diminishing bug bounty rewards from Microsoft.</p>
<p>This has become a common theme illustrating how reduced bug bounties are putting customers at risk.

<p>I hate not being an expert. Oh well. Here I am commenting anyway. I know you are looking beyond the company’s marketing, but do you wonder why WhatsApp is championing this particular security feature (E2EE) at this time?</p>
<p>It would almost seem short-sighted on their part to promote a privacy-philic posture if it invites more serious scrutiny into their general privacy practices &#8211; particularly if they are lacking.</p>
<p>Maybe at least being a lesser evil offers them a competitive advantage &#8211; both in terms of user approval and corporate liability.</p>

<p>Because they know secure e2ee is not possible on the devices most users will have? [see @Clive&#8217;s many explanations why not] So they are attempting to build up a big user base that can be handed on a plate [sold] to LEA.</p>

				<p>@ResearcherZero</p>
<p>Thanks for the article on the UN PETS Lab trials! I can access <i>The Economist</i>  from my library for free, thank goodness, so I could read the rest of the article.</p>
<p>For some reason I had not thought the UN would have a budget for this kind of data collection and analysis, especially for trade information.</p>
<p>They have some pretty interesting approaches to allow an outside party to run inquiries on another party’s data while retaining the confidentiality of the data. I wonder how the funding works for this.</p>

<p>If they do work out a lot of the hiccups, I’d think we’d see that kind of technology roll out for other uses. For groups to allow others access to their sensitive data, I’d bet they would have to have some pretty strong assurances in those privacy mechanisms.</p>
<p>It looked like that <i>Economist</i> issue had a few other really good articles! Thanks again for sharing!</p>

				<p>&#8220;When Siddharth Varadarajan, co-founder of the Wire, an independent online outlet in India, learned that Security Lab’s analysis showed that his phone had been targeted and penetrated by Pegasus, his mind immediately ran through his sensitive sources. He thought about a minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government who had displayed an unusual concern about surveillance when they met.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The minister first moved the meeting from one location to another at the last moment, then switched off his phone and told Varadarajan to do the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then “the two phones were put in a room and music was put on in that room … and I thought: ‘Boy, this guy is really paranoid. But maybe he was being sensible,'&#8221; Varadarajan said in a recent interview.<br />

				<p>Must feed the bots</p>
<p>See if you can spot them in this short thread.</p>
<p>Hint:  It is not Mike or Ken (@mmasnick or @popehat).</p>
<p>I feel bad for Ken that he actually read that, but, you know, he is the RICO dude. He has too many cats these days, which is why he takes long hikes.  I think there is some connection there.  Probably section 230 related.  The cats keep claiming censorship, but Ken invokes his 1st Amendment Right to take a hike.</p>
<p>My question thusly, is Mike whom I should go after because I read his re-tweet first, or should I go after Ken because he sourced it, even though it was my fault that I read Mike before I could read Ken first?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so confusing.  Emotional damage.  Maybe go after the fan manufacturers?</p>
<p>Oh, Ken, your next cat will not like you unless you feed it treats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next cat?&#8221;  you exclaim!</p>
<p>You can deny all you want, but you will be overruled, and you know it.</p>
<p>Your settlement will be to accept the new kitty, but you get to name it RICO.  Everyday, RICO will extort you for treats.</p>
<p>That is my ruling from the bench.</p>

<p>‘Boy, this guy is really paranoid&#8217;</p>
<p>While I have no knowledge of what was discussed, they may have made a mistake in opsec.</p>
<p>Parse closely.</p>
<p>Note that the report says they turned off their phones, and put them in a room with music playing.</p>
<p>It would have made more sense to turn off the phones, and put them in a refrigerator.</p>
<p>But, the important point to note is that it does not say that they remained in the room with the phones and the music.  They probably did not.  So, was another room without music actually secure?  And while there, was anyone able to access the phones in the room with the music?</p>
<p>Siddharth Varadarajan may have been led into a false sense of security.</p>

				<p>@ Ted, lurker, SpaceLifeForm, ALL,</p>
<p>Re : Not so secure apps.</p>
<p>The long answer short,</p>
<p><b>None of the current secure messenger &#8220;apps&#8221; are secure as &#8220;systems&#8221; you can safely use.</b></p>
<p>Which is a statment that is going to cause certain &#8220;Fan Buoys&#8221; and some others ruffled feathers, but can be proved to be true.</p>
<p>So a slightly longer answer,</p>
<p>The reason is that a secure &#8220;system&#8221; is a lot lot more than just the use of communications path crypto, no matter how clever it is.</p>
<p>That is you need to consider rather more than just the communications paths, when you use a communications system.</p>
<p>At the 20,000ft level you need to think about,</p>
<p>1, Message confidentiality.<br />
2, Identity Privacy<br />
3, Communications privacy.</p>
<p>Of &#8220;the whole system&#8221; not just the little part of it that the current &#8220;secure apps&#8221; supposadly protect. In practice they all fail one way or another in all those categories when used in a communications system based on consumer electronics.</p>
<p>So your overall safety / privacy / security is NOT there with systems that use these supposadly &#8220;secure apps&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you want me to go through the various issues in more depth I can do as I have in the past. I can also tell you how to make a system that &#8220;secures the communication&#8221;, without needing these apps. But it&#8217;s a lot of typing for me, and a lot of reading for you, and it&#8217;s certainly going to annoy some.</p>

				<p>@ ResearcherZero, SpaceLifeForm, ALL,</p>
<p>With regards,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Then “the two phones were put in a room and music was put on in that room … and I thought: ‘Boy, this guy is really paranoid. But maybe he was being sensible,&#8217;”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I and a colleague Roger Howe used to do that back when &#8220;Clive Corrie&#8221; of the UK&#8217;s OfCom was illegaly sticking his nose into Broadcast Warehouse business.</p>
<p>Roger had two largish &#8220;studio speakers&#8221; on the work bench and they had the &#8220;sound cloth&#8221; removed to reveal the actual units. One of which was a &#8220;mid range horn&#8221; that was a nice convenient size to hold a mobile phone&#8230;</p>
<p>So rather than turn the phones off we would turn the music right down and start an innane conversation about a &#8220;defect&#8221; we would put our phones in the horns. Roger would flip the mute button whilst saying &#8220;OK ear defenders on for this test&#8221; or simillar press a button on the radio tuned in to no signal and no antenna so just the noise floor static. He would then wind the volume control up to around eight and then unmute.</p>
<p>Not only was the room flooded with &#8220;White Noise&#8221; all the phones motion and other sensors were getting the full treatment as well.</p>
<p>Importantly unlike recorded music which is 100% predictable thus removable (Something the KGB were doing back in the 1960&#8217;s). The static from an untuned radio with no areial in it is almost 100% unpredictable[1], so not removable.</p>
<p>Roger and I would then go for a walk with cups of coffee / tea in our hands around Broadcast Warehouse&#8217;s building chating quietly and apparently inspecting, stock, wiring, lighting or anything else. We would even stop and talk to staff about stock, wiring, lighting, etc.</p>
<p>If any one else was wise to what we were upto they never said, they appeared to accept the old,</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask not into the madness of Directors, their ways are not to be fathomed, and they do control your wages!&#8221;</p>
<p>But&#8230; there were some occasions where we were genuinely doing Health and Safety / Fire inspections, and discussing where to put other testing stations etc in.</p>
<p>Oh and as anyone who ever worked with Roger will tell you, very loud music / white noise was more likely than not comming out of his work area.</p>
<p>Bur the important take aways,</p>
<p>1, The signal has to be random.<br />
2, You have to move around randomly, 3, preferably indoors in corridors and from room to room.</p>
<p>Otherwise the &#8220;interferance&#8221; signal can be stripped off, or if outside you can be followed by a &#8220;shotgun/parabolic mic&#8221;.</p>
<p>[1] In theory an opponent could transmit a high power signal with fake / psudo white noise on it, but&#8230; On Rogers bench being an RF bench there were a couple of spectrum analysers, so any such jamming would show up as a valid signal, or by the lifting of the noise floor.</p>

				<p><b>31 JAN 2022 &#8212; How to Secure your Health, Do I have to Mask you Again?</b></p>
<p>Whether it is vaccines, masks, guns, bodily autonomy, or fascism in the guise of the U.S. as a &#8220;Christian Nation&#8221;, a stern and firm response, not a strongly worded letter, becomes mandatory. Not only rebuked and shamed for this self dealing, but made aware of the complete obsequiousness of views not widely held or tolerated. It is to ask citizens to become servants, and as only a small minority of fools believe it is worthwhile to trade one form of social validity with another, let them use the electoral and political process to do so.</p>
<p>Subverting the system to foist their goals on others is completely unsustainable. Those proclaiming justification for subversion, do so outside the context of the social contract with and to humanity. Asserting supremacy over others, no matter the claim, false or dubious, or with a gun, is wrong morally, spiritually, ethical, and not in good faith. Simply stated; criminal conduct worthy of prosecuting. If I wake up tomorrow thinking, &#8220;Today I will change the rules for everyone else as I am not happy with the current ones. No rule of law, my rules and my law.&#8221;, is quite an ask&#8211;don&#8217;t you think[1].</p>
<p>A good example of this involves the requirement for vaccination within the U.S. military. Any airman, marine, sailor, or soldier seeking a religious exemption is being deceitful and disingenuous. If ones religious convictions, none of which include the rejection of medical remedies respecting plagues by the way, includes as a commandment, &#8220;Thou shalt not kill&#8221; begs the question; if you&#8217;re not engaged in practicing your religion faithfully, what expectation or duty does the government have in honoring any such claims? I can tell you, NONE. Do as Jesus would do, notify your CO of your status as a conscientious objector and see yourself out the door as you are in the wrong business, otherwise STFU[2].</p>
<p>[1] It comes from a mandate from the masses, not some farcical aquatic ceremony<br />

				<p>@ Clive Robinson<br />
You many remember the story I related to you about a HERF gun that we&#8217;d setup for a feasibility project and were at phase 2. At the shop location, fully metal building with interior and exterior sheet metal and I channel beams throughout, we&#8217;d a target bench, a d-dot probe, and a copper clad mobile instrument trailer. During phase three we moved to a hanger and had various simulated environments to do testing.</p>
<p>On one occasion, testing at full power with rep rates of approximately 1000 a minute, the target devices would die quite rapidly. One of the scientists wearing the copper body suit and the and head gear was at the trailer whilst the others, myself included, stood behind the HERF gun in observation. The success at reaching the effective field of merit was exceeded but the real result was bourne out by the reflected energy 180 degrees from the Blum line, and one story above ground. The I channel in the upper corner of the building 3 meters above and about 10 meters aft of the gun was throwing 1/3 meter arcs of EM at a near constant rate. Made some really good snaps occasionally. Someone should have called for inspecting the corona effect on the I channel, but I didn&#8217;t think about it at the time. We shut it down rather quickly sensing our own risk and exposure. I also thought to myself, there are some pretty smart fellas here in the lab, but where are they?</p>

<p>Yep, no WhatsApp for me, but I still like the premise of support for E2EE. WhatsApp really does collect A LOT more data than Signal don’t they? Thanks for the heads up.</p>
<p>It looks like there’s some more info on WhatsApp’s marketing push. Meta would like WhatsApp to be more popular in the US. However, it seems like Meta’s past behavior has made a lot of people skeptical and a little confused. They might need to do more than cheer for E2EE at this point.</p>

				<p>North Korea missile tests: Photos from space released<br />
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60193714" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60193714</a></p>
<p>=North Korea has released photographs which it said were taken from its most powerful missile launch in five years.</p>
<p>The unusual pictures taken from space show parts of the Korean peninsula and surrounding areas.[included in the article &#8211; pv]</p>
<p>Pyongyang confirmed on Monday it had tested a Hwasong-12 intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM).</p>
<p>!!!At its full power it can travel thousands of miles, putting areas like US territory Guam within striking distance.</p>
<p>outh Korea and Japan were both the first to report the launch on Sunday after detecting it in their anti-missile systems.</p>
<p>They estimated it had flown a moderate distance for an IRBM, covering a distance of about 800km (497 miles) and reaching an altitude of 2,000km before it landed in waters off Japan. At full power and at a standard trajectory, the missile can travel as far as 4,000km.</p>
<p>During the 8th Party Congress in January, Kim Jong-un said the development of military reconnaissance satellites and hyper sonic missiles, along with unmanned attack drones, are the major goals for the next five-year plan.</p>
<p>The country has already conducted two hyper sonic missile tests in January this year and experts believe, given the fact that the North released pictures from outer space, they will soon launch a reconnaissance satellite.=</p>

				<p>@Clive, @SpaceLifeForm, @All</p>
<p>re: <i>BA.2 Genomic Tree </i></p>
<p>A pretty good article on the origins of Omicron + sub-lineages has an excellent graphic which shows the &#8220;problem with Omicron&#8221; and it&#8217;s (non) relationship to all the previously known variants of SARS-CoV-2 (D614G, alpha, beta,delta etc).</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>A long new branch</b></p>
<p>An evolutionary tree showing the number of mutations in the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein illustrates Omicron’s distance from other variants.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The graphic illustrates several problems in determining origin and evolution. The tree branch bypasses all the known-IDed variants, starting around 2020.</p>
<p>There are 2 main hypothesis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Omicron arose from long term immune suppressed persons<br />
This model presumes that between 2020 and Q4 2021 the infection was in a &#8220;hidden population&#8221; which in Q4 2021 became &#8220;unhidden but still unknown&#8221;.</li>
<li>Omicron crossed to a mouse model and then back to humans<br />
The mouse model is based on a shared mouse+omicron gene that is not shared with other near or direct lineages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The graphic also illustrates an issue with genomic trees: they are very dependent on where and on what you select as an anchor and to some extent the form of the graph eg linear, radial etc. The representation selected is often connected to the naming convention. (1)</p>
<p>Continued expansion of SARS-CoV-2 to White Tail Deer (WTD) populations in Canada plus a lack of full animal genome tests and results is being addressed.<br />
The OIE World Organization for Animal Health has sent a request to share animal test results (01 06 2022).</p>
<blockquote><p>
It  has  been  demonstrated  that  SARS-CoV-2  can  infect  a  broad  range  of  species  and  both  mink  and white-tailed  deer  have  been  identified  as  potential  reservoir  hosts.  Recently,  there  has  been  much speculation that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant of concern, which has an unusual constellation of mutations, may have evolved independently in an animal host.</p>
<p>While  all  the  Omicron  mutations,  including  those  identified  as  affecting  receptor  binding  and immune  escape  have  previously  been  observed  in  human  viruses  (although  some  at  very  low frequencies),  a  rapid  assessment  of  available  sequence  data  does  not  suggest  a  close  relationship with an animal virus characterized to date. However, the number of amino acid changes in the spike protein sequence does suggest that the virus may have been subjected to positive selective pressure.</p>
<p>A search of the public available genetic sequence databases indicates a need for enhanced genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in animals. For example, there are over 6 million sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from humans  available on GISAID  EpiCoV database but only approximately 1,500 sequences  from animals&#8230;
</p></blockquote>

				<p>Pray.com collects data about its users in multiple ways. According to its privacy policy, the company records detailed information about users, including their physical location, the links they click on, and the text of the posts they make. Then, it supplements that information with data from “third-parties such as data analytics providers and data brokers,” which can include “your gender, age, religious affiliation, ethnicity, marital status, household size and income, political party affiliation and interests&#8230; geographic location, and Personal Information.” The policy also says Pray.com shares users’ personal information, including identifiers that link their activity to specific devices, with “third parties” for “commercial purposes.”</p>
<p>These apps, which also collect extensive information about their users, are backed by some of Silicon Valley’s best-known prospectors: Greylock Partners (Pray.com), Andreessen Horowitz (Glorify), and Peter Thiel (Hallow). Greylock, Andreessen, and Thiel are also all known for their investments in Facebook, which recently ramped up its own prayer offerings by rolling out a new tool called “prayer posts.”</p>
<p>At least one government has taken an interest in prayer app data, too — the US military bought extensive location data mined from Muslim prayer apps back in 2020 for use in special forces operations.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best way to communicate with God is silent prayer, no app required.</p>

<blockquote><p> I also thought to myself, there are some pretty smart fellas here in the lab, but where are they?</p></blockquote>
<p>I think that kind of &#8220;answers it&#8217;s self&#8221;, with,</p>
<p>&#8220;Being smartly as far away as possible&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mind you,</p>
<blockquote><p>The I channel in the upper corner of the building 3 meters above and about 10 meters aft of the gun was throwing 1/3 meter arcs of EM at a near constant rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>That &#8220;throwing 1/3 meter arcs&#8221; kind of implies something quite nasty&#8230; That is for an arc to strike it needs about 500V/mm as a minimum, usually helped by UV-B or UV-C&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh on the other stuff, I&#8217;ve never been fond of the &#8220;It&#8217;s my bat and my ball, and I&#8217;m going&#8230;&#8221; attitude, especially when the ground rules have been already agreed before the competition starts[1]. Changing things so that you are stopped for no reason other than some one feels they are entitled and you are not, is a good way to get me to put a little excercise behind my toe cap 😉</p>
<p>[1] I&#8217;ve told the story of me jogging along with a telegraph pole on my shoulder in advance of the rest of my squad, and being told &#8220;no thats not alowed&#8221; just when you are about to win is gauling at best. Getting annoyed and then chucking the telegraph pole back[2], much to the shock of most watching did give fair warning I was not amused.</p>
<p>[2] There is an art to throwing telegraph poles or the trunks of pine trees. It&#8217;s something you can learn with a little teaching and practice, oh and wearing loose clothing. But as most people can not pick a telegraph pole up by themselves in the first place the &#8220;does not compute&#8221; flag pops up in their head even when they see it fly end over end&#8230; You would have thought that beside the fact I was six and a half feet tall and built like a brick out house, the red-brown hair on the upper lip and the fact there was a photo of me wearing highland dress in the OR&#8217;s mess might have given the game away&#8230;</p>

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing, SpaceLifeForm, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>Omicron crossed to a mouse model and then back to humans</p></blockquote>
<p>Intuitively feels right, bearing in mind the time line and the part of the world where it is assumed to have originated, virtually unseen, and was only caught in SA in part because of the missing geen on the test kits.</p>
<p>But intuition and assumptions are worth nothing without the backing of solid science&#8230;</p>
<p>The fact that there are two &#8220;sister&#8221; mutations in the clade rather than a mother and daughter mutation indicates that somewhere it has had a high prevalence without being noticed&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let others make their own assumptions as to why it might not have been noticed, but in some respects it&#8217;s a blessing. One African Dr has called Omicron the vaccine we could not aford to make or buy&#8230;</p>
<p>What we realy do not know is why the second Omicron to get noticed (BA.2) is rather more infectious than all others, but also less pathogenic / leathal.</p>
<p>The person who finds out might well get a trip to Stockholm as it will be fundemental to moving our understanding of viral infection forward.</p>

				<p>Virtual reality could help make therapy easier<br />
New research shows many people are more comfortable speaking to an avatar than a real person<br />
<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/01/220105111424.htm" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/01/220105111424.htm</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The Edith Cowan University (ECU) study found 30 per cent of people prefer to talk about negative experiences with a virtual reality avatar, rather than a person.</p>
<p>Researchers compared social interactions where people engaged in VR conversation versus face-to-face.</p>
<p>They used full face and body motion capture technology to create a &#8216;realistic motion avatar&#8217; that closely mimicked their real-life counterpart, then analyzed how people interacted with avatars compared to people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall people rated VR social interaction as similar to face-to-face interaction, with the exception of closeness, where people tended to feel a little closer with each other when face-to-face,&#8221; Dr Rogers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This technology has the potential for broad application across a number of areas such as casual conversation, business, tourism, education and therapy,&#8221; Dr Rogers said.&#8221;</p>
<p>In security as well. E.g. reporting crime as witness, as victim.<br />
Communication of CI with handler which is basically not real person.</p>

				<p>@ pup vas,</p>
<blockquote><p>True story? Lie detection systems go high-tech</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a problem with all lie detectors, and that is you have to know you are telling a lie&#8230;</p>
<p>In essence for many lying is a &#8220;conscious action&#8221; and it is this that causes changes on Fast MRI scans, breathing pulse rate etc.</p>
<p>If however you lie but not consciously, then the tells are not there.</p>
<p>There is also another way, which is &#8220;to lie with the truth&#8221; or &#8220;lie with a question&#8221;.</p>
<p>Rather than say &#8220;I did not kick him&#8221; you say &#8220;I did not hit him&#8221; or similar. The other way is to say &#8220;Why would I kick him?&#8221;</p>
<p>It confuses the results.</p>
<p>But there is the 5-20% of the population that have sufficient socio/psychopathic mental disorder that to them nothing they say is realy a lie, so no tells&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to get &#8220;impressive results&#8221; with compliant test subjects or those who are not under stress, and where the experimenters have effectively &#8220;pre-screened&#8221; the test subjects by where they select them from.</p>
<p>Quite a few people are unaware that &#8220;left handed&#8221; people are almost always screened out of these sorts of experiments. Getting on for two decades ago, I asked a friend who&#8217;s proffession it was why those who were left handed were left out&#8230;</p>
<p>The answer I was given, was a truth told as a joke for levity. Which was,</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble with you lefties, is you are not wired up right&#8221;.</p>
<p>So I suspect that 20-25% of the normal population, simply by being left handed would not give the right results.</p>
<p>I tried looking around for &#8220;research&#8221; about such differences some years ago and it was most notable by it&#8217;s absence&#8230;</p>

<p>re: <i>Covid will be happy to spread amongst the Russian troops. </i></p>
<p>No worries, they already have it. What will happen is the Russian Variant of the Day will propagate in Ukraine and Ukraine can have the Belarusian version too for no extra charge.</p>
<p>There are sub-lineages aplenty to share.</p>
<p>We might be importing more than we export. The USA already exports a good deal of COVID globally. Check any area around a US Base to count the bar-ways.</p>
<p>Russia normally uses one of their Sputnik series vaccines, Sputnik Lite is quite good.  The USA won&#8217;t be getting anything better til mid-year.</p>
<p>Down Under the AU Gov has OK&#8217;d the importing of &#8220;unapproved test kits&#8221;.</p>
<p>Consider the use case:</p>
<blockquote><p>
What is the point of test kits that yield inconsistent answers and cannot detect the virus until 3-5 days after infection during which period the person is highly infectious?
</p></blockquote>
<p>The scale of global alcohol dependence is staggering&#8230; Just ask BYOB Boris.</p>

<p>The Chinese are rather determined to ensure that nothing distracts from the resounding success of their Olympic games are ordered to be. And with so few &#8220;friends&#8221; in the world, Putin would not like to provoke the wrath of the Chinese.</p>
<p>Or so the reasoning goes.</p>

				<p>@ Clive<br />
Busted a gut, are you not Scottish? Sounds like some time with lads at SAS.<br />
&#8230;</p>
<p>@ JonKnowsNothing</p>
<p>Thanks to you and Clive, you brought me back to my last wire wrap project some 18 years ago. Holly heifer, that was not fun. But it was worth it, a pre-production prototype platform, VME backplane and support for three custom test boards for modular hardware and software development. Reduced development cost and time, helped keep the shoelaces on the shoes. Some of the tedium in building out your own platforms, no prefab conveniences but at the die level and it is you that must transit the gap. Routing, placing, and bonding a moderate project or system does take patience and a nimble hand. Sometimes I had a situation that required retreating slightly, regrouping, and then forging ahead. The wire wrap VME construction was just such a project.</p>
<p>And you brought it all back from the recesses that I thought lost to&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks Gents!</p>

				<p>@ Freezing_in_Brazil</p>
<p>Butterflies and ThunderSnow</p>
<p>I have an interesting WX situation coming up.</p>
<p>I do not want any ThunderSnow, but it likely will not matter.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I noticed this strong low, off of the coast of Alaska.  It was not going to be an Alberta Clipper.  I knew it would get here in 5 days.  My thought then was I would see 4-8 inches of snow.  I knew where it was going, in order to reload.  Somewhere near Texas and Oklahoma panhandles.</p>
<p>The models were not even close to agreement.</p>
<p>Yesterday, it looks worse.  So, I upped my forecast to 8-12 inches of snow.</p>
<p>There was no official NWS guestimate late Sunday.  Now it is officially a Winter Storm Warning (that means ice or at least 4 inches of snow expected).  There is nothing happening yet.  The models still do not agree yet.  They will converge on my model.  I&#8217;ve seen this movie before.  It will follow I-44 across Missouri.  Exactly how it tracks will determine who gets hit hardest.</p>
<p>I may still be low on my forecast.  I say that because the official NWS forecasts are catching up to me (still a bit below 8-12, but they are learning).  Usually, when I have a bigger amount than NWS, I usually am right.  They are hesitant to overforecast.  Then they bump when I already called it 12-24 hours before they figure it out.</p>
<p>So, now, I am calling for at least one foot in my area.  12-18 inches of snow. The last time we had ThunderSnow here, 2 foot in 48 hours.  I do not want ThunderSnow, but I will take that over a bunch of freezing rain and sleet.</p>
<p>The storm is reorganizing.  It is coming.  I&#8217;ve seen this movie before.  The only sign currently is the rain moving over Texas now, from the gulf to the northwest.  That is visible.  The rest is in the computer.</p>
<p>I hope I am wrong, but I do not think so.  I will update.  Rain in about 12 hours, then its going to go downhill.  Definitely snow by 36 hours.</p>
<p>Lightning flashes in a snow storm are cool to see.</p>

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>There are sub-lineages aplenty to share.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunatly it might be my turn.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not well, serious head ache, and aches in muscle and bones, that I have not felt since I was wearing the green and unfriendlies did rather more than loosen teeth with fists and lengths of rubber.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve no idea what it is, I went to bed feeling like I&#8217;d got the chills and woke up in quite vocal pain. With nightmares of things past. I can&#8217;t realy get out of bed as the shakes cause me to colapse up against the walls and furniture.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve managed to get several bottles of water by the bed, and as importantly several empty plastic milk jugs as well.</p>
<p>If things do not improve I&#8217;m going to have to work out how to get down stairs, then call an ambulance. But one thing is clear none of the major joints are stable so it carries some risk.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try and stay in contact but the brain is well below sub-par at the moment, and things get rather noisy if I fall asleep. Some memories you don&#8217;t want poping up.</p>

				<p>@ Folks, thank you for the kind wishes&#8230;</p>
<p>Turns out yes I&#8217;ve got a blood infection and the body is dealing with it without anti-biotics.</p>
<p>But because I feel so ill they took a look at my blood preasure which is very low&#8230; That led onto a couple of other tests&#8230;</p>
<p>So they have discovered I&#8217;ve  a bit of a dodgy ticker issue which they have way more concerns about&#8230;</p>
<p>Apparently your heart is not supposed to be running at 140bpm when you are lying prostrate on the gurney&#8230;</p>
<p>They are talking about giving me a dose of Ketamine (Horse Tranquilizer) then stick a couple of big electrodes on and throw &#8220;The more power Egor switch&#8221; to see how far I can jump etc..</p>
<p>Apparently it&#8217;s called cardioversion,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Synchronized electrical cardioversion <b>uses a therapeutic dose of electric current</b> to the heart at a specific moment in the cardiac cycle, restoring the activity of the electrical conduction system of the heart.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>But despite the size of the pads, that therapeutic dose leaves burn marks&#8230;</p>

				<p>@Clive:</p>
<p>So much for my intuition!</p>
<p>A close relative had a perhaps more extreme version of electrical therapy, with stop (induced cardiac arrest) and restart to correct a persistent arrhythmia.</p>
<p>I wanted to say &#8220;I hope the bell for coffee break doesn&#8217;t ring just before the restart,&#8221; but judged that this would perhaps not be helpful.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re under close watch at the moment, those infections are no joke.</p>
<p>Anxiously awaiting news that your condition is improving &#8230;</p>

				<p>UPnProxy &amp; EternalSilence</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>UPnProxy is alive and well. There are 277,000 devices, out of a pool of 3.5 million, running vulnerable implementations of UPnP. Of those, Akamai can confirm that more than 45,000 have been compromised in a widely distributed UPnP NAT injection campaign. These injections expose machines living behind the router to the Internet and appear to target the service ports used by SMB.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Akamai researchers reported on how Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) was being abused by attackers to conceal traffic, creating a malicious proxy system we&#8217;ve called UPnProxy. Because UPnProxy can be leveraged to route an attacker&#8217;s traffic at will, there is a serious risk that this flaw can be leveraged in a number of attacks, including spam, phishing, click fraud, and DDoS.</p>
<p>Now, six months later, we&#8217;re seeing evidence that UPnProxy alive and well. Out of a potential victim pool of 3.5 million vulnerable devices, 277,000 of them  are vulnerable to UPnProxy. Our scanning revealed at least 45,000 actively injected machines, those with the telltale routes already in their port mappings. These numbers are subject to change as the attackers continue to scan for new machines to compromise. While some of the campaigns observed in the original research have since disappeared, a new campaign of injections has been discovered.</p>
<p>In Akamai&#8217;s previous research, we highlighted the possibility that attackers could leverage UPnProxy to exploit systems living behind the compromised router. Unfortunately, data from this recent batch of injections suggests this is exactly what&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p>For home users, these attacks can lead to a number of complications, such as degraded service, malware infections, ransomware, and fraud. But for business users, these recent developments could mean systems that were never supposed to exist on the internet in the first place, could now be living there unknowingly, greatly increasing their chances of being compromised. Even more concerning, the services being exposed by this particular campaign have a history of exploitation related to crippling worms and ransomware campaigns targeting both Windows and Linux platforms.</p>
<p>The Attacks</p>
<p>After observing millions of successful injections attempting to expose millions of machines running SMB services, Akamai researchers speculate the actors behind EternalSilence are running this campaign with the intention of leveraging the Eternal family of exploits.</p>
<p>EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144): The widely-known exploit stolen from the NSA and released by Shadow Brokers, impacts every version of Windows, and even after widespread patching took place (MS17-010), criminals still managed to leverage the exploit code to launch devastating attacks, such as WannaCry and NotPetya.</p>
<p>EternalRed (CVE-2017-7494): Sometimes known as the sibling to EternalBlue; targets Samba and opens the Eternal family up to Linux-based systems. It&#8217;s been used in a number of crypto-mining campaigns and became widely-known as SambaCry.</p>
<p>Recent scans suggest that these attackers are being opportunistic. One possibility is that they&#8217;re scanning the entire internet for SSDP and pivoting to the TCP UPnP daemons. Alternatively,based on scan results and banner grabs, they&#8217;re targeting a set of devices which utilize static ports (TCP/2048) and paths (/etc/linuxigd/gatedesc.xml) for their UPnP daemons.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re doing this in order to blindly inject SMB port forwards. This is only possible because there are millions (3.5 million) of vulnerable routers on the internet, and plenty of them (277,000) are running vulnerable implementations of UPnP that expose themselves and their IGD (Internet Gateway Device) controls on the WAN/Internet side of the router &#8211; something we addressed in our previous research.</p>
<p>The goal here isn&#8217;t a targeted attack. It&#8217;s an attempt at leveraging tried and true off the shelf exploits, casting a wide net into a relatively small pond, in the hopes of scooping up a pool of previously inaccessible devices.</p>
<p>This shotgun approach may be working too, because there is a decent possibility that machines unaffected by the first round of EternalBlue and EternalRed attacks (that may have remained unpatched) were safe only because they weren&#8217;t exposed directly to the internet. They were in a relatively safe harbor living behind the NAT.</p>
<p>The EternalSilence attacks remove this implied protection granted by the NAT from the equation entirely, possibly exposing a whole new set of victims to the same old exploits.<br />
<a href="https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/upnproxy-eternal-silence#:~:text=Below%20is%20a%20simple%20bash%20script%20used%20during%20this%20research" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/upnproxy-eternal-silence#:~:text=Below%20is%20a%20simple%20bash%20script%20used%20during%20this%20research</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Because there is a decent possibility that (vulnerable) machines unaffected by the first round of EternalBlue and EternalRed attacks were safe only because they weren&#8217;t exposed directly to the internet. They were in a relatively safe harbor living behind the NAT,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The EternalSilence attacks remove this implied protection granted by the NAT from the equation entirely, possibly exposing a whole new set of victims to the same old exploits.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve located a device compromised with Eternal Silence, disabling UPnP won&#8217;t clear the existing NAT injections. Instead, users will need to reset or flash the device.</p>
<p>Also, applying the latest firmware update should be a priority as the device vendor may have addressed any UPnP implementation flaws via a security update.</p>
<p>&#8216;Eternal Silence&#8217; is a very cunning attack because it renders the practice of network segmentation ineffective and doesn&#8217;t give any indication of what is happening to the victim.</p>
<p>The best way to determine if your devices have been captured is by scanning all endpoints and auditing the NAT table entries.<br />

<p>I’m so glad that you sought care and are working with a medical team. These experiences can be really nerve-racking, but it sounds like you are in good hands.</p>
<p>I once knew someone who had cardioversion performed. He had tachycardia and it got his heart back into a normal rhythm. I believe they had him on a home heart monitor for a while after, and then medications. Those concerns have very high standards of care. You absolutely did the right thing going to the hospital and I hope you are getting some much needed rest and comfort.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Have you noticed any change in sunset colours, or is it still staying too cloudy to even notice?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hello my friend. Sorry for the late answer. In fact I saw a TV report showing the effect in the city of Rio de Janeiro and other places in Southeastern and Southern Brazil. In São Paulo there were reports, but I myself didn&#8217;t notice anything different. Note that we have been under overcast skies and heavy rainfall for almost a month now [much like a monsoon, although the climate here is humid subtropical].</p>
<p>Situation got better in Argentina and Paraguay. Their heat wave dissipated sometime ago now.</p>
<blockquote><p>
So, now, I am calling for at least one foot in my area. 12-18 inches of snow. The last time we had ThunderSnow here, 2 foot in 48 hours. I do not want ThunderSnow, but I will take that over a bunch of freezing rain and sleet.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I have been following the news. The variation of the climate in the USA is something that always fascinates me. Hope all is ok with you as the front approaches the east coast [I see the cold air mass already taking over the midwest and parts of the south]. Good luck!</p>
<blockquote><p>
Lightning flashes in a snow storm are cool to see.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Boy, that&#8217;s the summer attraction around here. The relatively monotonous landscape of the plateau acquires these three-dimensional textures with the towering clouds. Last week I saw a parade of impressive cumulus-nimbus. I hadn&#8217;t seen them in years.</p>
<p>Climate wise, La Nina seems to have a knack for bringing the old pre global warming mood to a revival when it happens. I see it as a farewell. At the rate we are at, these memories of the old climate will show up less and less as time goes by. I don&#8217;t expect to see a raining season like this one more than five times in the rest my lifetime [I’m quite young still].</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>MSM is reporting aid ship HMAS Adelaide has a major power loss and has been effectively disabled in Tonga. Civilian technicians and spare parts have been flown in for repairs. Crew are reported to be mostly on deck because of no A/C below. I haven&#8217;t been able to determine if she is still tied up at the pier; presumably so if no steerage or ability to raise or lower anchors.</p>
<p>A veritable plague ship.</p>

<p>re: <i> AU bringing COVID to Tonga </i></p>
<p>A few reports on the &#8220;contactless&#8221; transfers indicated that the AU Ships were tied up at the port and that cranes were used to off load the cargo.</p>
<p>Presumably</p>
<ul>
<li>AU ship crews readied and secured the hooks to lift the cargo</li>
<li>Tonga crane operators lifted and placed the cargo either on a truck, flatbed or set down on the dock for the 72 hour COVID fomite hold </li>
</ul>
<p>A new pre-print of a Challenge Study with D614G found you only need 1 nasal droplet to get infected with SARS-CoV-2.  This matches empirical results of the rapid spread.  A different report indicated Delta needed only 10secs of exposure for infection. A recent report found that Omicron is far more infectious and the safe distances are wider 64ft and the hang time for aerosol is 20min with the most infectious being the first @6-7 min.</p>
<p>So, 2 scenarios:</p>
<p>1) A fair breeze across the deck of the ship carries to the dock and crane worker and the off loading area. The infected crew on deck working the hook and pallet with a constant supply of viral particles blowing to the dock for the duration of the off loading session. No fomite needed for this scenario.</p>
<p>2) Infected crew sneezes, coughs or wipes nose and then handles the hook and pallet. Follow by a fair breeze across the deck of the ship carries to the dock and crane worker and the off loading area. 2 for 1: aerosol and fomite transmission.</p>

<li>afaik the distance studies are done in controlled lab environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full drift distance would be max of 20min-3days * wind velocity.  3 days is a common It&#8217;s Dead Jim date and 20min the common max limit for aerosol viability with the first 6-7 minutes being the most infectious.  So 1-20min * wind velocity would be the drift area.</p>
<p>Even taking in to account some dispersal, recent reports that one droplet  is enough to cause infection.</p>
<p>8 meters = (39 inches * 8)/12 = 26 feet. Well withing both the new-min and the old-max viral cloud distances.</p>
<p>Consider a light breeze at 4mph<br />
The cloud could carry 1 mile/1600 meters in 15 minutes and 4 miles/ 6437 meters in one hour.</p>

<p>“Investors will be affected by uncertainties about the legal arrangements that will apply in the Timor Gap after independence. To maintain large-scale investments required for projects that are expected to go into production after 2003, operators require assurances on the rules that will apply.</p>
<p>“Without a smooth transition of the legal arrangements for the Timor Gap, there is a risk that investor confidence will fall away and commercial activity cease, with the result that neither Australia nor East Timor will draw revenue from the area.”</p>

				<p>The rules about farming equipment could help boost the wider “right to repair” movement, which has gained steam across the country in recent years. Consumer rights groups like U.S. PIRG, a federation of nonprofit public interest research groups, or PIRGs, say people have a fundamental right to control devices they already own, especially when they need to be fixed. Over the last few decades, they say, companies have made third-party repairs nearly impossible by locking software, writing prohibitive warranties or restricting spare parts.</p>
<p>The tactics have affected everything from iPhones and laptops to tractors and neonatal incubators. One notable exception are cars, which consumers can repair at any garage they want because of a 2012 Massachusetts law that carmakers later agreed to apply nationally.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to figure out ways to empower farmers to make sure they can stay on the land. This is one of the ways to do it,” Tester said. “I think that the more we can empower farmers to be able to control their own destiny, which is what this bill does, the safer food chains are going to be.”</p>
<p>“I visited with my local mechanic and asked which tractor he could fix, and it was a 1995 one,” Potmesil said. “New equipment is getting so complicated and loaded with sensors. If one of them goes out, you can’t even start your tractor. You need a technician and software to identify the problem.”<br />

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing, lurker, MarkH, SpaceLifeForm, Winter,</p>
<p>Re : SARS2 fomites and aerosol spread.</p>
<p>You may remember I was woried about &#8220;national boarder&#8221; trade interfaces right back in early 2020 getting on for two years ago, and indicated this was a probable significant risk factor for nations that were effectively &#8220;islands&#8221; as far as boarder control and hard lockdown is concerned. I discused the use of UV-C lamps anf Hydrogen Peroxide washing/bleaching.</p>
<p>I also said there was no research being done&#8230; and it was becoming clear to some here and other places that boarder controls had becoming very politically charged, so that research was unlikely to be carried out&#8230; And that the proven insufficient &#8220;2meter mantra&#8221; would just keep being rolled out.</p>
<p>Well I guess with Tonga, the first of the &#8220;Butchers Bills&#8221; on the political nonsense has now become not just &#8220;late payment&#8221; but &#8220;well overdue payment&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>There has been clear warning signs for nearly all that time period with reoccuring events, yet the research that could have been done ten times over in that period has not been done, nor probably will be done for political rather than science reasons&#8230;</p>
<p>Most especially research into the viability of deep frozen virus particles in the -18 centigrade and lower temperatures major global commodities such as food is &#8220;longterm stored&#8221; in[1] for trading and transportation.</p>
<p>If we don&#8217;t do the research, then any policy put in place might as well have be plucked from the basser outpourings of a deities fetid and rotting temporal orifice[2].</p>
<p>[1] Such &#8220;deep frozen&#8221; foods by blast / flash / immersion fast freezing, and tgen kept below -18 Celsius are stored this way for as much as 7years, at -30 it&#8217;s almost indefinately&#8230; See the likes of &#8220;fish futures&#8221; commodities markets where &#8220;stone weight&#8221; blocks are traded like bars of semi-precious metals.</p>

				<p>@ Anders,</p>
<p>Re : Biden threatening Chip Supplies to Russia,</p>
<p>This Axios site link is less intrusive than &#8220;the yahoo&#8217;s&#8221;[1],</p>
<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/chip-blockade-russia-sanctions-biden-314d7d9f-f1d7-4a72-b357-55d8756dc08d.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.axios.com/chip-blockade-russia-sanctions-biden-314d7d9f-f1d7-4a72-b357-55d8756dc08d.html</a></p>
<p>The Biden Policy has one major flaw, the US lost it&#8217;s territorial control over &#8220;chip manufacture&#8221; some decades ago due to &#8220;short sighted&#8221; political and corpro-economic reasons. The actual &#8220;root of control&#8221; are two companies one in Switzerland that makes the optics that go in the foundry machines made in another European country and shipped to where the leading edge chip Fab Plants are&#8230;</p>
<p>US State Dept thinking thus policy &#8211;now those that habituate the Dept have woken up&#8211; is that China will invade Taiwan, and effectively Japan and South Korea as well as other South China Seas, and West Pacific Nations via what would back in the days of sail have been called a &#8220;naval blockade&#8221;[2] (but would involve air as well as sea transportation these days).</p>
<p>So the US State Dept under preasure from not just US Corporates but the US DoD, have recently been preasurising the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor(TSCM) which is arguably the world&#8217;s most advanced and largest semiconductor manufacturers in the world to build Fabs in the US (which the Taiwanese Government is very reluctant to alow for obvious self protection reasons[2]).</p>
<p>So Biden&#8217;s ill thought out threat, will encorage many companies to not just plan to &#8220;design out&#8221; US IP but US manufactured / controled product as well. Some companies that I&#8217;m directly aware of, have &#8211;since the Trump Administration trade war&#8211; implemented a &#8220;No US Parts Policy&#8221; in primacy over their &#8220;Two Source for Parts Policy&#8221; as self protection[4]. The knock-on effect of which will be to actually strengthan China&#8217;s control of advanced international communications infrastructure and similar. So the plans of US companies to try and get a major hold on what will become &#8220;6G&#8221; in the near future will get quite a set back.</p>
<p>[1] I don&#8217;t use Yahoo for good and proper &#8216;Privacy Reasons&#8221;, so I&#8217;ve not read their article. I simply take their URL chop the HTTP(s) off and repla3ce it with &#8220;site&#8221; and then put a space in after .com/ and chop out all put the page title and stick it in a search engine. Which generally gives me a variety of views on the subject. Much of the time when I do this sort of search I get identical or near identical copies of stories as the &#8220;Internet News Scene&#8221; could also be called &#8220;Rip Off International&#8221; with some major players like Rupert &#8220;the bear faced liar&#8221; Murdoch&#8217;s News International and related sites doing one heck of a lot of &#8220;Riping Off&#8221; of other peoples primary stories.</p>
<p>[2] China are already doing this with their &#8220;artificial islands&#8221; policy and making other nations fishing vessels &#8220;Disappear&#8221;. Also their conflict with US and other Nations Navy vessels all in what are &#8220;International Waters&#8221; that China is trying to annex.</p>
<p>[3] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC</a></p>
<p>[4] Since a series of Earthquakes in Japan critically effected the semiconductor industry, a wake-up call went around the Electronics industry more than a decade ago. These articles gives you an idea of why,</p>
<p>hxxps://www.ventureoutsource.com/contract-manufacturing/end-era-japanese-earthquake-semiconductor-chip-manufacturing</p>
<p>hxxps://www.eweek.com/networking/japan-earthquake-could-deal-blow-to-semiconductor-industry/</p>
<p>But the significant Kobe Earthquake nearly three decades ago fired an early warning shot, when people realised that a very great deal of the materials used in turning actual chips of silicon into bonded out packages for PCB manufacture had been destroyed. But much more recently the curious series of events a year back that has taken out most audio and analog signal chips for control systems &#8211;like engine managment&#8211; has made many electronics related products manufacturers realy realy nervous about securing supply lines over the three to five year design-manufacture life cycle and longer supported life cycle.</p>
<p>Or to put it another way if you are a manufacturer of some of the worlds more expensive luxury cars, boats, planes and similar you do not want to have to kill production to do a major redesign because you can not get hold of a $0.25 semiconductor chip. And that is before considering the quater century &#8220;supported life expectancy&#8221; of the product via replacment parts&#8230;</p>
<p>Adding political nonsense on top of already concerning geological and climate vulnerability issues is not making the US look like a &#8220;safe pair of hands&#8221; in fact the near opposit. After all ask yourself the question, &#8220;Do you want to have critical surgery done on say your brain or heart, done by a person who though they might have great expertise, also are known to have unexpected attacks of epilepsy or catalepsy?&#8221; How about being in a plane flown by a pilot with similar issues? A taxi? At what point do you say the risk is one you will personally take in full knowledge of the other persons issue? How about when it&#8217;s not you but your only child?</p>
<p>Or take similar risks with a company you have spent a large chunk of your life building up from nothing, with a politically volitile nation such as the US has become?</p>
<p>Obviously &#8220;You would not put all your eggs in one basket&#8221;, so the threats of the two most recent US Executives, over &#8220;high tech sanctions&#8221; will make not just traditional commercial &#8220;second sourcing&#8221; but now geo-political &#8220;third sourcing&#8221; a major design consideration and one that will actually back fire on the US considerably. That is to some &#8220;Made in the USA&#8221; will be the equivalent of a ticking time bomb&#8230;</p>

&#8220;The actual “root of control” are two companies one in Switzerland that makes the optics that go in the foundry machines made in another European country and shipped to where the leading edge chip Fab Plants are…&#8221;</p>
<p>Hope things are going well.</p>
<p>Although you formally are right, this is not how it works. I know, for example, that the Dutch firm ASML that is market leader in semiconductor lithography systems (it makes the machines that make the chips in almost everything), was easily forced to stop exporting these machines to China. Which was stupid, as it forces the Chinese to develop start developing them themselves.<br />
ht-tps://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2022-01-19/asml-still-has-no-licence-to-ship-newest-machines-to-china-ceo</p>
<p>If the US government threatens to put these companies on a blacklist, they will abide. As they have always done. That is not just legalese. If patent licenses are terminated, banks refuse to do business with you, components are not delivered, etc, that is the end of most high-tech companies.</p>
<p>It is indeed much more difficult to prevent the finished chips to reach Russia, or China, Iran, etc.. But the manufacturing can be stopped quite easily.</p>

<p>The tiny url was a slight humorously attempt. Not my best talent though…</p>
<p>It’s looking like I owe a clarification:</p>
<p>I am adept of solving disputes with diplomacy. Regardless of how banal or naive it may sound, I am stubborn on keeping in mind that war is a source of unspeakable suffering for too many innocent persons.</p>
<p>My views about Putin/Russia are coincident with the ones regularly expressed here, as they are obvious and based on historical facts. [1]</p>
<p>My views about Biden[2]/US sudden recent media campaign regarding Russia-Ukraine war in Europe are cautious, as all the sudden MSM apparatus brings me to mind certain past US propaganda-like campaigns, being the most vivid one how we were so fooled about “WMD”. That particular lesson taught me to value “doubt” and looking from diverse sides as an exercise of checking, previous to any assumption.</p>
<p>That inner cautiousness compelled me to share here some relevant diverse points of view that seemed to be overlooked in the ongoing discussions, which nevertheless I’ve been well appreciating.<br />
I wonder, which of my posts or links are to be considered pro Russia propaganda?</p>
<p>I agree with @Clive, a knowledge of history [3] is paramount in this matters. Mine is limited, as is most ones’ in this blog. In this respect, I thank him and @Winter for their distinct and valuable contributions.</p>
<p>[1] Righteousness apart, in this Ukraine case I think it’s understandable the Russia’s tension regarding NATO settling down just at the other side of the border, as it would be understandable US’s tension facing a hypothetical political alignment of Mexico with Russia or with China, including weaponry installation, etc.</p>
<p>[2] I am grateful to him who got the world rid of the 4 years long “orange nightmare” (nothing to do with the Netherlands, he)</p>
<p>[3] Though it must be avoided to “dabble in history only insofar as it takes to convince others history repeats itself”.</p>
<p>[4] For that reason I keep my posts are short – and also for my abhorrence of conspiracies, and for my poor English fluency.</p>

<p>Lol. Oh yes, that NYT’s article does a good job trying to throw light on the hoodwink. As you saw, the article reported that many “assailed the ad as “shameless” for implying that glory awaits those bold enough to gamble their savings in a volatile unregulated market.”</p>
<p>Walking just a few steps down to another exhibit, we see this class action lawsuit filed against Kim Kardashian and others for their promotion of the cryptocurrency EthereumMax.</p>
<p>Giovanni Perone, a co-founder of EthereumMax, is also a defendent in the lawsuit. From the complaint:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Defendant Perone described his prior experience in “the hedge fund space” and had “significant experience structuring nuanced securitizations and financing arrangements,” and he touted EthereumMax as something “special” with “real sustainability.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Pulling my wallet out now. Very much kidding of course 🙂</p>

				<p>Turkey&#8217;s intelligence agency abducts arms dealer in Ukraine<br />
<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/turkeys-intelligence-agency-abducts-arms-dealer-in-ukraine/a-60634563" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.dw.com/en/turkeys-intelligence-agency-abducts-arms-dealer-in-ukraine/a-60634563</a></p>
<p>=An arms dealer who had started to expose Turkey&#8217;s clandestine arms trafficking networks was snatched during a Turkish intelligence operation. The whistleblower had claimed kickbacks reached the highest offices in Turkey.</p>
<p>Nuri Bozkir is a man who many believe poses a threat to the Turkish president. The abducted arms dealer is viewed as one of the few people who could unveil systematic wrongdoing by the Turkish government because he was an integral part of its covert weapons shipments to war zones.</p>
<p>The Turkish national intelligence agency, MIT, captured the arms dealer-turned-whistleblower in Ukraine, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told pro-government media last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our intelligence found that this person was hiding in Ukraine and we talked to [Ukrainian President] Zelenskyy about him being caught,&#8221; Erdogan said. &#8220;Our intelligence service and great cooperation with its partners made this arrest possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>In interviews with Ukrainian news site Strana at the end of 2020, Bozkir had disclosed delicate aspects of Turkey&#8217;s clandestine arms transfers to militant groups operating in Syria and Libya, noting that MIT operatives would take a cut from the deals.</p>
<p>Bozkir, a former special forces captain in the Turkish armed forces, said he would legally buy weapons in eastern European countries and have them shipped to Turkey, where Turkish intelligence would divert them to battlefields across the region.</p>
<p>The former arms dealer was still fighting the extradition request when he was abducted, with Ukrainian judges having yet to issue a final ruling. The Turkish and Ukrainian governments did not respond to DW&#8217;s repeated requests for comment regarding the extrajudicial Turkish operation on Ukrainian soil.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing I can say is that according to the laws of Ukraine, what the Ukrainian security service has done is illegal — it is an excess of power, and they can be held criminally liable,&#8221; Denysiuk added.</p>
<p>Turkey&#8217;s transnational campaign is &#8220;notable for its heavy reliance on renditions, in which the government and its intelligence !!!!!!agency persuade the targeted states to hand over individuals without due process, or with a slight fig leaf of legality,&#8221; Freedom House said in a 2021 report.=</p>

<blockquote><p>Nothing in that report points to such speculative possibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>No it does not, the report does not speculate on anything in particular that we know of.</p>
<p>In the parts of interest to potential mechanisms, it&#8217;s basicaly based on scientific and similar known facts. Importantly it does not try to go backwards and link something that is scientificaly possible and demonstrable as being anything but a potential cause to consider for what is not yet even established effects. It also clearly states that there are &#8220;gaps&#8221; in the chains of things considered.</p>
<p>Part of the problem we are seeing is that people are confusing,</p>
<p>1, Intelligence statments.<br />
2, Investagative evidence.<br />
3, Established science by &#8220;experiment&#8221;.<br />
4, Nature as described through mathmatical models of &#8220;theory&#8221;.<br />
5, What mathmatics actually does.</p>
<p>The Fundemental laws of as we currently know them are by no means correct or even necessarily fundamental. In fact there is an oldish truism,</p>
<p>&#8220;Physics as taught is a succession of lies, each more accurately describing what we see by carefully chosen experiment, than the previous lie&#8221;.</p>
<p>Any theoretical physicist will tell you that there are limits on what we currently know. In part this is due to the fact we don&#8217;t currently have the ability to test things that underly what it is in effect what we assume. Also we have what might be called &#8220;a lack of imagination&#8221;. Theory moves forwards on what people hypothesize might be a cause of an observed effect. Even in the &#8220;Shut up and calculate&#8221; club of quantum mechanics progress is limited by both what can be tested and what can thus be imagined and linked mathematically.</p>
<p>But mathmatics is a semantic tool[1], like language, all it realy does is provide a description of reality. It is not in any way a part of reality but one that is useful for predictions. That is it just models a subset of any particular aspect of reality[2] based on observations of reality.</p>
<p>[1] The use of &#8220;semantic&#8221; should be considered a red flag in any term in science in much the same way &#8220;trusted&#8221; is in Information Security. Both have &#8220;domain specific meaning&#8221; that often appears at odds or even the opposite of &#8220;common usage&#8221;. In the case of &#8220;semantic&#8221; consider,</p>
<p><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2018.0041" rel="nofollow ugc">https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2018.0041</a></p>
<p>Which also brings in aspects of &#8220;Information theory&#8221; that under pins &#8220;information security&#8221; thus &#8220;trusted systems&#8221;.</p>
<p>[2] Consider &#8220;plastic deformation&#8221; it has a mathmatical model that describes a force induced temporary deformation process in a linear region. But it has very real limits on it&#8217;s use even in the one physical state &#8211;solid&#8211; it is generally applicable to. The model is actually a gross simplification of what can be more fundementaly described in QED models. But QED is not without it&#8217;s limitations and magic numbers. It is often considered unusably complex</p>

<p>re: <i> UK proposal for taxation tracking for cars </i></p>
<p>A MSM report on a proposal in the UK to enact a &#8220;road price tax&#8221; to track cars as they access roadways for a per-mile use tax.</p>
<p>The primary problem is that since COVID has kept people home, there has been less gasoline purchased so fuel taxes have fallen dramatically.  Additional impacts include people switching to electric cars. They have a £35bn fuel tax shortfall.</p>
<p>So to make up the £35bn tax shortfall, they are planning on setting up a &#8220;road use tax&#8221; before people stop purchasing petrol altogether.</p>
<p>Currently fuel taxes, in general, help maintain roads (although some are more potted than others). So, the &#8220;greening of the environment&#8221; means there won&#8217;t be enough funds from fuel taxes to fix whatever they are able to fix.</p>
<p>The new alternative is tax whatever runs on the road on a Per Journey Tax Fee.</p>
<blockquote><p>
a national scheme that priced up a journey based on the road, time and type of vehicle, offering better prices at less congested times. (1)
</p></blockquote>
<p>Similar to getting a grocery delivery during off-hours to save $1.95.</p>
<p>And this is how they plan to do it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
[the program] should be implemented through location-tracking technology in cars, backed up by automatic number plate recognition.
</p></blockquote>
<p>===</p>
<p>1) HOV lanes or High Occupancy Vehicle are commuter lanes that have restricted access during prime commute hours.  If the vehicle-car has 2+ persons they can run in the HOV lanes passing cars with a solo driver who&#8217;s stuck in the caterpillar backup slow lanes.</p>
<p>Originally touted as a way to encourage ride sharing and reduce the commute time window, they actually increased the time of the commuter crunch since not that many people opted for ride sharing (for many reasons including security, and syncing of time tables).  So the majority of commuters were stuck in fewer lanes, taking longer to get to the destination. Due to the increase time for arrival, the commute window got wider and wider.</p>
<p>Some places added an &#8220;access fee&#8221; for solo drivers to use the HOV lanes during the restricted hours. They are sometimes then called LEXUS Lanes.</p>
<p>Several funny (or not funny) situations where entire convoys of VIP + MORE VIPS were rolling in the HOV lanes and got stuck behind car poolers in the lanes.  As the slow lanes were jammed bumper to bumper, there was no way for the LEXUS Lane cars to get out of the way of the VIP convoys running up their rear bumpers into their kid&#8217;s rear safety seats.</p>

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing, ALL,</p>
<p>With regards the Tonga Cocid crisis and the hight of the Austalian ship above the dock and,</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t think you need to consider wind drift too much, gravity will do the trick</p></blockquote>
<p>You forgot to mention the &#8220;Distance to the horizon&#8221; issue and the coverage radius thus coverage area.</p>
<p>Obviously as the hight increases the radius thus the coverage area goes up.. but by how much?</p>
<p>Well the radius to area is easy it&#8217;s the area of a circle.</p>
<p>If we remember geometry from school, the area enclosed by a circle is</p>
<p>Area = Pi Radius^2</p>
<p>We would also have been told in more advanced maths to find trends you can ignore constants and look for the highest power term&#8230; So it boils down to the area of a circle increases by the square of the radius. Which is what you would expect as the area of a box is width time hight and as they are both the same you end up with area equals width times width, or width squared.</p>
<p>So the take away is r^2.</p>
<p>But how do you work out the radius? This is harder but imagine as a first aproximation a triangle with hight and radius forming the right angle. The hypotenuse would be the drop of a viral particle under gravity for a given velocity of particle ejection by cough/sneeze etc.</p>
<p>Ignoring for the moment other factors we can find a time for the vertical drop from the hight, and finding the radius is found by using that time to convert the ejection velocity into the distance measure.</p>
<p>But when we look at the formular for a partical falling under the influance of gravity we find that the rate it falls at increases with time due to Gravitational Acceleration. That is its drop accelerates as some funtion of time. For the Earth near sea level we get told,</p>
<p>Gravitation Acceleration is,</p>
<p>GA = 9.8m / seconds^2</p>
<p>So the hypotenuse of our triangle is not a straight line but a an inverted power law curve. Where the take away is -(t^2), where the time &#8216;t&#8217; is derived from the particle initial velocity coughed/sneezed parallel to the &#8220;radius&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which gives an interesting result, doubling the velocity does not double the radius, it only increases it by &#8220;the square root of two&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Using the old text book &#8220;As an excercise for the reader&#8221; I&#8217;ll let others work out the exact formular for this &#8220;first approximation&#8221;. But in practical terms the radius thus area is constrained fairly quickly.</p>
<p>But how accurate is this &#8220;first approximation&#8221;?</p>
<p>Turns out not very accurate at all. As we intuatively know from watching a feather drop, it very very quickly reaches a terminal velocity due to the air resistance and stops accelerating so that -(t^2) becomes very quickly just -t especially for very small particles. In fact below a certain size they will almost &#8220;float&#8221; descending so slowly that even the initial sneeze/cough velocity has such a small effect it is negligible.</p>
<p>So in reality the distance a viral particle spreads is pedominantly due to the wind velocity prevelant at the time. Which as it&#8217;s a &#8220;bulk movment&#8221; will if the wind is &#8220;on shore&#8221; lift the viral particles with the profile of the terrain.</p>
<p>But the viral particle has a limited life time measured in &#8220;half lifes&#8221; which is an exponential decay curve with respect to time which is related to humidity and inversely to temprature. Also we might expect the density of viral particles to drop due to the fact they are individual and radiated from a point source&#8230; Howrver as their movment is due to bulk air movment you will not get a vary high radiation spread factor, that is it will move as a slowly expanding cloud of particles&#8230;</p>
<p>In short the dominant factor is wind speed tempered by the viability half life.</p>
<p>But also the &#8220;viral load&#8221; required to be infected. With Omicron B2 this is very very small so with a moderately strong on shore breeze, you are looking at easily clearing the &#8220;docks area&#8221; and &#8220;getting into town&#8221; thus causing rapid community spread&#8230;</p>

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing,</p>
<p>re: UK proposal for taxation tracking for cars</p>
<p>This has been proposed by every Chancellor of the Exchecor / Treasury since Tony Blair was Prime Minister.</p>
<p>What has always stopped it in the past, was rhe ROI in an election cycle would be strongly negative.</p>
<p>In short the only way they could do it is by legislation for new cars, otherwise the voters would punish the incumberant politicos harshly.</p>
<p>But the reason why people are not buying petrol is the same one as why they are not buying new cars. The only apparent &#8220;growth&#8221; is in hybrids and electric. But the reality is that there is only growth because the number of electric vehicles sold was pitifully small, untill the rise in things like the London Congestion Charge, and the more than $10/gallon petrol pricing which is atleast three times the US average price and expected to rise dramatically in the next few months.</p>
<p>Then there are &#8220;insurance hikes&#8221; for various reasons.</p>
<p>Even &#8220;out of town&#8221; shopping centers are feeling the squeeze, as home working makes home delivery way more easy. Public transport has also taken a major hit so they are using one heck of a lot less fuel as they cutback on services.</p>
<p>The problem is off course going to be &#8220;Energy Company Shareholders&#8221; who will expect to see well above inflation rate growth. Which can only happen if they sigbificantlt disproportionately raise energy prices&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Glad to see you are still thinking well</p></blockquote>
<p>Sort of I&#8217;ve still got &#8220;lack of sleep brain fog&#8221;.</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>Thank you to all who have wished me well, I&#8217;m by no means out of the woods yet and there have been major changes to the medications that will need not just time to settle in, but time to have lots and lots of monitoring tests&#8230;</p>
<p>I already feel like I&#8217;m a pin-cushion close to retirement with the number of blood samples that have been taken. With every one marked by a  number of colourful bruises, due to quite high doses of blood thiner usage to clear out clots and the like, I therefore look very strange if my sleves are rolled up.</p>

				<p>@Clive, @All</p>
<p>re: <i>Car Tracking </i></p>
<p>The car tax was interesting in that the &#8220;not new&#8221; proposal would use a GPS systems in modern cars (1), tied with license plate recognition.</p>
<p>Both have been active for some time but their tracking patterns trivialized.</p>
<p>Nearly all new cars come with a satellite type connection service, even if you do not subscribe, the service is active. You can always push the Red Button to report your crash and enroll a subscription for towing service to get your car out of the ditch.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s not been high on MSM reporting is that this integrated system has been tracking cars all the time anyway.</p>
<p>License plate readers have been common in intersection in the USA and are part of the basis for Automated Tickets with picture of front of car+driver+license plate sent as proofs for fines.  Mobile readers are on cop cars, and roving tow trucks and repo-services scanning licenses plates as they prowl the highways.</p>
<p>Presumably they will set up camera-recorders for &#8220;toll road ingress&#8221; on every on-ramp and &#8220;toll road egress&#8221; on exit ramps.</p>
<p>Tracking people driving to their local market and shop via surface streets would have some Start Point Mark where the vehicle has been stopped for n-time and then a matching End Point Mark were the vehicles stops again for n-time.</p>
<p>Or they can out source the entire project to G$$$ because G$$$ already does this.</p>
<p>The other outfits that can do this, and do it every day are the Satellite Security Monitors. They have been pretty careful not to reveal too much about how good their camera systems are, and only publish fuzzy photos of kill-jobs. (2)</p>
<p>The only add-on is the billing part, using a MustPayBill like car insurance might work except lots of people don&#8217;t have insurance even if it is required.</p>
<p>It might have a social backlash because the system won&#8217;t know a &#8220;good place&#8221; from a &#8220;bad place&#8221; that might cause embarrassment.  US Cops have been known to stake out areas based on &#8220;bad place&#8221; assumptions. Dangerous to buy a loaf of bread at the mini-mart but also visiting a non-spousal-person-of-interest.</p>
<p>Imagine: The annual MustPayBill shows up with a detailed listing of all road uses similar to Call Detail Records.<br />
&emsp; Date, Start Location, End Location, Time, Roads Used</p>
<blockquote><p>
Well she got her daddy&#8217;s car<br />
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now<br />
Seems she forgot all about the library<br />
Like she told her old man now<br />
And with the radio blasting<br />
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now</p>
<p>And she&#8217;ll have fun fun fun<br />
Til her daddy takes the t-bird away
</p></blockquote>
<p>===<br />
1) It was not stated but the Smartphone GPS/Bluetooth connection to the car might also be tapped.</p>
<p>2) iirc(badly) In an interview with some former US Drone Operator-Pilots about their tour of duty and the aftermath of firing on a target, the pilots indicated a complete disjoint between their own perceptions of what happened and what took place.</p>
<p>Each indicated they had been extremely careful in target selection and when to fire. They could see each target area clearly, what people were wearing, their locations, the children, all structures and vehicles, and things in motion: cars, people walking, people working. Each understood they had killed some people around the target but they had personally calculated this to be a small number of collateral damage.</p>
<p>At the end of their tours, they were given an envelope stating their true number of kills. After the first ones opened the envelope word got around: Don&#8217;t Open The Envelope.  The ones that did found they had killed not just the 7-10-15 targeted persons but hundreds more.</p>

				<p>@ Bruce Schneier.</p>
<p>I made a lengthy post in reply to a poster in this thread and it&#8217;s also been read by others. It was on the science behind a security issue of interest currently. I explained things for which it&#8217;s actually hard to find information for, that indicated why a US Gov Agency document was not saying things, other security and technology Mainstream sites think it should have.</p>
<p>But now my educational post has been deleated purposfully.</p>
<p>I would like a clear response as to why this was done?</p>
<p>Because putting time into producing educational content that is very hard to get elsewhere is a service to the community that reads this blog. It was as far as I could see not in contravention of this blogs &#8220;stated&#8221; rules.</p>
<p>So whilst it directly effects me, it also is a diservice to the community of readers that come to this blog to be very much better informed than they can get even via research university led academia.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also clear from other comments that have been made, that other posters of educational content have had their posts &#8220;go missing&#8221; or known it to have been purposefully deleted.</p>
<p>Two things are clear,</p>
<p>1, The number of people posting, let alone posting quality content to this blog is declining sharply.<br />
2, The purposeful deleations are on the rise.</p>
<p>What the intended logic behind this might be I&#8217;ve no idea. But the result is clear, this blog is being killed off via a purposeful exsanguination of it&#8217;s life blood of quality information unavailable almost anywhere else, made available here years ahead of when it might finally appear in an almost unavailable academic paper or equivalent.</p>
<p>If you want for some reason to kill this blog off, at least be honest about it.</p>

<p>Hmmm&#8230;.</p>
<p>Hopefully you saved yourself a copy?</p>
<p>And could send those of interested a copy given your e-mail address?</p>
<p>Many &#8216;news&#8217; sites seem to do the same thing. The copy gets important details deleted after a bit. A quick look at my archived copy and a diff is more than curious! I now have quite a file of textualized news stories. Small size and easy to read.</p>
<p>An early write up of the recent Chinese software showed they reported breathing and stomach abnormalities! Later these terms were no longer being reported in the reverse of their software?</p>
<p>If you give me one of your e-mails, I would like a copy!</p>
<p>Big and little brother/sister are over active! No wonder I no longer turn on the TV and radio!</p>

				<p>@ John,</p>
<blockquote><p>Hopefully you saved yourself a copy?</p></blockquote>
<p>No, I deleted after I&#8217;d confirmed it was on both the thread page and the 100 last comments page.</p>
<p>But appart from the exact wording I can remember the sources I refrenced and the points I made.</p>
<p>Whilst it&#8217;s something I don&#8217;t paste to the Internet I&#8217;ve a way longer more detailed set of information done for an agency who then bashed it into a report and presentation they give to select non technicals who need briefing on a near one to one basis. So in a way it&#8217;s not only memorised I can provide more depth from memory as well.</p>
<p>If you remember back about a quater of a century there was a US ViceP who was quite a bit more switched on in terms of not just science but technology as well. He pointed out about the Risks to Nat Sec of what we would now call OSInt, where you find pieces of information very much in the public domain and like a jigsaw piece them together to reveal what some were hoping to keep secret or atleast unknown.</p>
<p>Well as I point out from time to time when evaluating a technology idea or even suspicion of one I ask &#8220;Do the laws of physics alow?&#8221; and you would be surprised just how many of what appear to be &#8220;fantasticals&#8221; do come up yes. Then if it is a yes I start geting down into the more specific technology required and importantly what the constraints and costs on it. After all the old &#8220;Find me a leaver and a fulcrum and I will move the world&#8221; is sort of alowed by the laws of physics the constraints in terms of materials does not, but even if they did, the costs would not. There are several other &#8220;tests&#8221; that apply including the very presumptious &#8220;Could I build it?&#8221; but it&#8217;s to answer the actual test of &#8220;If not why not?&#8221; and &#8220;What do I need to change to be able to build it?&#8221;</p>
<p>There is an interesting story along these lines about a Dutch and Swiss company I mentioned that @Winter commented on.</p>
<p>Well&#8230; Looking at the MIT Review what did I notice they had the story written out much more readably than I would write it,</p>

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing,</p>
<p>Whilst this may well be true,</p>
<blockquote><p>Nearly all new cars come with a satellite type connection service, even if you do not subscribe, the service is active.</p></blockquote>
<p>New cars sales are in quite some decline in the UK. In fact so few new cars were selling the manufacturers had to resort to an underhanded tactic. That is many people were pushed into lease type agreements where they paid monthly, but&#8230; where the manufactures could &#8220;force&#8221; the person into another lease in as little as a couple of years as they legaly owned the car, not the consumer.</p>
<p>What has brought this to a head I&#8217;ve been told is that due to lockdown and the consequential &#8220;home working&#8221; for &#8220;middle class&#8221; consumers, they have basically walked away from the lease and have instead gone to the &#8220;old banger&#8221; second hand market.</p>
<p>The midle class customers that the auto industry relied upon are increasingly opting to go what was seen as the preserve of &#8220;working class&#8221; types and buying older thus non Satellite equiped vehicles, many of which already have &#8220;excemptions&#8221; that save the actual &#8220;owner&#8221; &#8211;who is the consumer&#8211; money.</p>
<p>Some estimates say that &#8220;Ex-fleet&#8221; vehicles will be the prime source of newer &#8220;second hand vehicles&#8221;. Mostly comming in via auction.</p>
<p>Almost certainly a thriving &#8220;strip back&#8221; service will rise up and even if installed the satellite systems will cease to function for a &#8220;Hundred in yer pocket&#8221; with no real ability for authorities to chase things down.</p>
<p>Pushing manufacturers to integrate sat systems so that they have to be functioning for the vehicle to work will get opposed as it&#8217;s going to make their products very unreliable. So fighting it to save the good name of their products whilst not a direct legal requirment is something there shareholders would want persued.</p>
<p>Thus the UK Gov need to rethink just how they are going to make the system not just work, but be reliable. All before they start looking into anti-avoidence measures.</p>

				<p>@ Freezing_in_Brazil</p>
<p>The storm has passed.  My forecast was a bit off (too high).</p>
<p>Generally, most of my area got 6 to 10 inches of snow.  Some less, some more.</p>
<p>Two things happened.  The storm had a early wave where some spots got a lot of snow (more than expected), but most areas got more freezing rain and sleet.  Colder, drier air moved in quicker than expected after the first wave.  The second wave (the main storm) took longer than expected to arrive, and it ran into the drier air.  The track was good, up I-44.</p>
<p>It was a mess Wednesday and Thursday.  No one out.  Most places closed or reduced hours.  No deliveries.  Since Covid, it is hard to find road clearing staff.</p>
<p>Good sunshine today.  Temp now is 5F, -15C.</p>
<p>Should get back above freezing Sunday during daytime.  Of course stuff will re-freeze at night.  But I have 100 pounds of rock salt.</p>

				<p>Re: &#8220;Havana syndrome&#8221;</p>
<p>I offer a highly personal observation, which might perhaps be related.  Anyway, I guess that Clive may find it interesting.</p>
<p>Several times over the years (I estimate in the range of five to ten instances), I have heard an impulse sound coincident with nearby (&lt; 750 m) lightning strikes.</p>
<p>It was not the thunder, which was always very perceptibly delayed from the flash, but rather a very sharp (but not very loud) &#8220;snap&#8221; with no perceptible delay from the flash.</p>
<p>The first few times I experienced this was in a room with a table fan; I speculated that the ground strikes induced enough voltage for momentary arcing in the appliance&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; until a memorable summer walk when I was &#8220;caught out&#8221; in a thunderstorm of great intensity.  My path took me under a large power transmission line, and I saw strikes on all four of the nearest pylons.  As I recall (&#8217;twas long ago) I heard the snap sound for the strikes on the two pylons either side of my path.</p>

				<p>Continued: I concluded that what I heard was not an air pressure transient reaching my ears, but rather an effect of electromagnetic induction in some cranial nerve(s).</p>
<p>Like any arc discharge, lightning emits radio frequency energy over a broad range of frequencies.  Although measurements show peak energy at long wavelengths (~100 km), emissions are measurable at sub-meter wavelengths.</p>
<p>Considering that the RF power of a lightning discharge might be on the order of tens of megawatts (very briefly!), I think it plausible that short wavelength RF might account for my experiences.</p>

				<p>@ MarkH,</p>
<blockquote><p>It was not the thunder, which was always very perceptibly delayed from the flash, but rather a very sharp (but not very loud) “snap” with no perceptible delay from the flash.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which makes the effect what ever it is &#8220;local to you&#8221;. But how local?</p>
<p>Sound travels at ~300m/Sec and Human &#8220;response delay&#8221; time is usually not greater than 200mS or 1/5th of a second. So 300/5 = 120m or ~364ft maximum. But the reality of &#8220;perception dely&#8221; rather than &#8220;perception+action=response delay&#8221; is -20mS or 1/50 or 12m /  36ft.</p>
<p>Now as I&#8217;ve mentioned before there is &#8220;magneto-constriction&#8221; effects. That is any conductor in a magnetic field will try to act like a motor and turn or jump proportional to the strength of the magnetic field the current in the wire and the angle of incidence. The small coil at the base of a speaker cone can produce significant mechanical movement so quite large amplitude sound.</p>
<p>Lightening is generally a one way flow of current of fairly high value, so a DC Pulse, with an attendent high magnetic field generated.</p>
<p>So any conductor carrying even AC house hold current is going to be effected.</p>
<p>But there is also another audible effect that of charge transfer into a capacitance. If you dump charge into a capacitance it will for a short time have current flow. Normally the capacitance is small and the current not that high so any induced mechanical effect would be of very short duration. But pizo buzzers and the like can be heard quite effectively, that is some dielrctric materials realy do twitch a lot.</p>
<p>Then there is the &#8220;Quad ESL&#8221; speakers, some decades ago back in 1975 Quad brought out it&#8217;s first &#8220;Electro-Static Loudspeaker&#8221;(ESL) monitor speakers. In essence a mylar diaphragm between two very highly charged perforated metal plates.</p>
<p>One of the failings of the ESL was &#8220;breakdown&#8221; where an arc discharged the static charge, which could take upto half a minute to be reestablished.</p>
<p>Which brings us onto the acoustic effects of discharges&#8230; For simplicity consider there are two types of arc those that have high current and those that have low current, and produce sound via different effects.</p>
<p>Back in the 1970&#8217;s I attended a lecture at the IEE at Savoy Place in London, where an &#8220;Arc Log Horn&#8221;(ALH) was demonstrated. This used a high current RF arc of less than half an inch that was amplitude modulated up around 27MHz it had a highly linear wide band audio response but had standing wave issues that the Log Horn removed. A &#8220;Log Horn&#8221; also called a &#8220;log periodic horn&#8221; is a very wideband transmission and matching line and you can see them used to cover UHF (300MHz) 1m wavelength up through the currently commercialy used microwave range upto (30GHz) 1cm range. The flair curves of which are aesthetically appealing in their own right and are similar to those seen on &#8220;brass instruments&#8221; such as Trumpets.</p>
<p>But there are high voltage or &#8220;corona discharge&#8221; effects that very locally ionize air but do not produce the sort of arcs you might expect to see. They are most often a result of RF very high voltage but very low currents discharge into air rather than into a conductor. Like the basic conductor to conductor arc they can produce very &#8220;high quality&#8221; sound but of lower frequency range. An efficient transducer of such is a resonant antenna. If you stand close to the ends of an antenna that is an odd 1/4 wave long, the impedence is very high of atleast 2000ohms and usually a lot more. So the voltage is very high at the end of a quaterwave antenna even at comparatively low powers like 10watts you get corona discharge and if the RF signal is amplitude modulated in the audio range the corona discharge will be effective thus &#8220;sing out&#8221;.</p>
<p>Whilst there are other mechanisms that might turn lightning into actual sound waves, those are the main ones you would have to look for first.</p>
<blockquote><p>I concluded that what I heard was not an air pressure transient reaching my ears, but rather an effect of electromagnetic induction in some cranial nerve(s).</p></blockquote>
<p>As I have previously indicated but was &#8220;purposefully deleated&#8221; a few days ago, there are two basic effects on nerves from any movment of charge.</p>
<p>1, I Squared R heating effects<br />
2, Rising edge effects.</p>
<p>Both are high power events but the first is high energy whilst the second is actually low energy. That is the rising edge of a very short duration pulse can be pico seconds in duration but it&#8217;s energy integrated over say a one second period be considerably less than a joule. The principle is used in RADAR and certain specialised radio systems. Energy is charged into a &#8220;capacitive transmission line&#8221; and a switch such as an avalanche device or ionizing radiation enhanced arc gap used to discharge it in pico (10e-12) or even femto (10e-15) seconds. Obviously the peek power is multiplied, so 1watt over 1second charging becomes 1mega-megawatt over 1pS discharging.</p>
<p>Whilst the &#8220;heating effect&#8221; is very minimal (about 1/100 of your bodies heat generation) the potential &#8220;physical insult&#8221; of an induced movment is quite significant.</p>
<p>Why would there be movment well nerves are &#8220;sodium channel conductors&#8221; and &#8220;nerve impulses&#8221; are movments of charge. So can be subject to the effects noted above.</p>
<p>Nerves are surrounded by a &#8220;lipid layer&#8221; or grosely simplistically &#8220;white fat&#8221; as an insulator. If this breaks down then epilepsy can be the result. Any pastry chef can tell you fats are very very easy to press flat at body temprature. So any physical insult will cause damage to nerve insulation and potential break down thus detrimental neurological effects (look up CTE in American Football players). Importantly the effect of physical insult is one way, thus accumulative&#8230;</p>
<p>As the insulation &#8220;thins&#8221; the effective capacitance between any two nerves increases so the ability of &#8220;crosstalk&#8221; between nerves increases. Some from observation believe that &#8220;spontanious muscle tremors&#8221; can be a sign of such &#8220;crosstalk&#8221; effects from degraded nerve insulation. They could be right, but it would be very unethical at best to test such a theory on a sentient creature.</p>

<p>Hmm&#8230;.</p>
<p>Nerve sheath problems. Makes sense.</p>
<p>Animal fats are longer than veggie fats. This leads to serious problems for people who get no animal fats and/or &#8216;funny&#8217; fats. i.e.- &#8220;Standard American Diet&#8221;.</p>
<p>I seems to me to be easy to cause and observe glitch caused problems in animal behavior.</p>
<p>From what I read, brain tissue changes in the Havana syndrome are observed?</p>
<p>I assume the research has already been done? Maybe just not commonly known or maybe classified?</p>
<p>If I or you could ask the right question, the answer is probably obvious!</p>

				<p>@ John,</p>
<blockquote><p>If I or you could ask the right question, the answer is probably obvious!</p></blockquote>
<p>The answers are faily obvious from basic laws of nature, and in various ways and places the evidence of effects are evident to engineers and others who chose to look.</p>
<p>The problem is &#8220;science&#8221; does not work &#8220;from effect to cause&#8221; because an effect can occure from any number of causes.</p>
<p>If you look at the report you will find the word &#8220;gaps&#8221; appears a couple of times. This means that either &#8220;the effect&#8221; or &#8220;charecteristics&#8221; that appear from it have been cataloged. But they do not know for certain which of the potential causes they have identified it is.</p>
<p>We may never know for sure if the pulses of microwave energy are acoustic or radio frequency.</p>
<p>Which ever it is I would put a small wager on it using resonence effects in the head/brain as that couples maximum energy from the signal into the structures.</p>
<p>Have a look at 19mins onwards for a couple of mins,</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y2L6QLOi-c" rel="nofollow ugc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y2L6QLOi-c</a></p>
<p>And remember that transducer is a &#8220;speaker coil&#8221; just like that in your home HiFi speakers and it is quite a bit less than 30watts of effectively &#8220;pulsed&#8221; power going into the device, importantly at it&#8217;s resonant frequency (you don&#8217;t get to see the full rate of movment because of the way low cost digital cameras work).</p>
<p>You just have to know where to find a demonstration of the hypothesis that is, legal, ethical, and moraly acceptable.</p>
<p>Look back to the last century and  &#8220;vibration white finger&#8221;(VWF) which causes &#8220;Secondary Raynaud&#8217;s Syndrome&#8221; for an example of non resonant vibration effects, which can also happen due to &#8220;cavitation&#8221; effects (it&#8217;s one effect ultrasonic baths clean with).</p>

				<p>@Clive:</p>
<p>In descriptions of startling/shocking incidents &#8212; perhaps in particular if the experience was intensely emotional &#8212; witnesses often recall events &#8220;out of order&#8221; (that is, in a sequence contradicted by physical evidence).</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t &#8220;calibrated&#8221; my resolution of time differences between seen and heard events, though my experience seeing films displayed with sound out-of-sync are suggestive that even time differences of less than 0.1 sec are easy to notice.</p>
<p>One of my nerdy habits is to &#8220;count out&#8221; the delay from flash to boom in order to estimate my distance from the lightning.</p>
<p>Even if I don&#8217;t trust my assessments that the flash and snap were simultaneous, I had as a &#8220;backup&#8221; (independent of sight) that I heard both the snap and the actual thunder.</p>

				<p>continued, 1:</p>
<p>From my engineering experience, it seems to me that when two &#8220;steep attack&#8221; sounds are separated by at least 50 msec, I hear them as distinct.  This would correspond to the case of a lightning strike less than 20 meters distant, and I should prefer never to come that close to a lightning discharge &#8212; people get hurt that way.</p>
<p>When I heard the snap sounds (which appeared simultaneous to the flashes) the delay before the thunder attack was in the hundreds of milliseconds.</p>
<p>My understanding is that people have been known to &#8220;hear&#8221; radar transmitter bursts (presumably with exposure in excess of today&#8217;s safety and health standards).</p>
<p>Accordingly, it seems plausible to me that my &#8220;lightning snap&#8221; sounds could well be examples of the same phenomenon, however it operates.</p>

<p>A musicologist told me that in a symphony orchestra, expert percussionists play just ahead of the beat indicated by the conductor&#8217;s baton, to compensate for time lag so that the attack sound of their instruments will be on beat as it reaches the front of the stage (percussion is typically at the rear of the orchestra, and thus farther from the front row instruments &#8212; and the conductor&#8217;s time-keeping baton &#8212; than the other players).</p>
<p>Without this compensation, the percussion attacks would be late by roughly 30 msec.</p>

<p>Re: EMF energy effects</p>
<p>Related &#8211; recently released study by University of Washingon and Johns Hopkins seems to indicate non-ionizing EMF as in LTE, 5G etc., over time, are having negative effects on many aspects of wild ecosystems.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s sauce for the goose etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;Abstract</p>
<p>Ambient levels of electromagnetic fields (EMF) have risen sharply in the last 80 years &#8230; including rural/remote areas and lower atmospheric regions. Because of unique physiologies, some species of flora and fauna are sensitive to exogenous EMF in ways that may surpass human reactivity. There is limited, but comprehensive, baseline data in the U.S. from the 1980s against which to compare significant new surveys from different countries. &#8230; Biological effects have been seen broadly across all taxa and frequencies at vanishingly low intensities comparable to today&#8217;s ambient exposures. Broad wildlife effects have been seen on orientation and migration, food finding, reproduction, mating, nest and den building, territorial maintenance and defense, and longevity and survivorship. Cyto- and geno-toxic effects have been observed. &#8230; Part 1 questions today&#8217;s ambient EMF capabilities to adversely affect wildlife, with more urgency regarding 5G technologies. Part 2 explores natural and man-made fields, animal magnetoreception mechanisms, and pertinent studies to all wildlife kingdoms. Part 3 examines current exposure standards, applicable laws, and future directions. &#8230;</p>

<p>Nice article references. Interesting titles and abstracts.</p>
<p>$42 to read them!! WTF!!</p>
<p>Just more scientific junk research if you cannot read it and try to reproduce it!</p>
<p>A farmer friend puts an emf from power lines shield under his sprouting plants. Claimed it makes visible differences.</p>

				<p>@ null clam,</p>
<blockquote><p>indicate non-ionizing EMF as in LTE, 5G etc., over time, are having negative effects on many aspects of wild ecosystems.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s the total energy over time issue again.</p>
<p>If the effects of &#8220;non-ionizing&#8221; radiation such as EM signals is &#8220;cumlative&#8221; even very very fractionally then yes that is the result you would get.</p>
<p>Do we know if it is cumulative, well no, but we have reasonable assumptions to think not.</p>
<p>Look up &#8220;plastic limits&#8221;, &#8220;work hardening&#8221; and &#8220;metal fatigue&#8221;.</p>
<p>They are all the result of kinetic forces, EM radiation tends to be not kinetic, it causes small heat effects, and the thermal energy flows like water &#8220;down hill&#8221; figuratively speaking as it moves from hot to cold by basic diffusion.</p>
<p>But even non-ionizing EM radiation effects are &#8220;non-linear&#8221; at some point and proteins are definately not linear above body temprature (hence cooking in a microwave).</p>
<p>One of the assumptions of the NIH is that the flow of blood etc will carry the heat away and that the body will reduce thermogenisis to compensate.</p>
<p>However we know from accidents that areas of the body where circulation is low, such as the eyes, get more easily damaged by thermal energy.</p>
<p>The issue at heart is not one of mechanism but limits, the NIH is just interested in drawing a line of &#8220;safety&#8221; for radiological exposure, and they try where ever possible to remove &#8220;time&#8221; from their limits.</p>
<p>Legislation and regulation in general care not about time either, because being over or under a prescribed limit is both clear and easy to adjudicate.</p>
<p>Nature cares not a jot for others rules and appears to thwart or fight them at every turn.</p>
<p>My view is we do not yet know enough to even investigate, let alone come to conclusions about wether the low energy EM signal levels cause accumalative damage or not. The only factor saying &#8220;no&#8221; currently is that they are very much part of the environmental background.</p>

				<p>@ Zeus,</p>
<blockquote><p>Hubris is a sin that the gods (the Greek ones) tend to punish in creative ways&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Hubris is your wrong assumption.</p>
<p>For every human so far their time is limited, so they have to make a choice on what they do with it.</p>
<p>If you are a frequent reader of this blog you will have seen,</p>
<p>&#8220;Selfinterest Rights -v- Social Responsability&#8221;</p>
<p>As an argument. You might also know of,</p>
<p>&#8220;A rising tide lifts all well found boats&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well I happen to believe from a liftime of experience that &#8220;Social Responsability&#8221; via education &#8220;lifts all&#8221; including you and myself. That is the result is we all benifit from a better educated populous as it lifts society and peoples living standards. But it is also clearer that the opposit is true.</p>
<p>Now when you &#8220;create&#8221; you end up with a &#8220;work&#8221; that is legaly recognised, because it has value, that is lost to the creator by theft or destruction of the work. It&#8217;s why you would like as not end up in jail if you walked into a public place such as a gallery and stole or damaged a picture or other work on display for public benifit.</p>
<p>I could go on but consider,</p>
<p>It is my choice how I spend my time, I would above the necessity of meeting my somewhat basic needs, prefere to improve society. This is not altruism, after all I do as I&#8217;ve indicated gain from it as do you and most others. But there are those selfish few who insist on selfinterested rights for them alone, thus they object to improving society as &#8220;taking money from their pocket&#8221;. You only need look back on the various &#8220;Free Software&#8221; initiatives and how they were treated to realise that&#8230; With a senior Microsoft Employee screaming in public it was &#8220;cancer&#8221; as but one of very many examples.</p>
<p>Now you might think that sitting somewhere tearing up banknotes is a worthwhile activity. Whilst for a chosen few that is true, it&#8217;s not true for the majority of people who loose value if they do.</p>
<p>So whilst I am happy to give to society because as I&#8217;ve indicated I and many others benifit from it. I see making worth to have it destroyed not a particularly motivating activity.</p>
<p>Hence I asked what the hidden rules were.</p>
<p>So no, not hubris just common sense behaviour.</p>

I will preface my comment with an acknowledgement that Bruce has been most generous with both his time and materials (this site). My concerns mirror yours when it comes to comments finding not the ether but the ethereal domain. When on more than one occasion it was necessary to post information and news related to existential threats to all our security, the topic or great importance, met with the trash heap of historical /dev/null. I cannot seem to put my finger directly on the methodology for editorial bludgeoning but suspect a motive that is not supportive of specific critiques&#8211;this is troubling.</p>
<p>I too can only rely on the witnesses to the original post before a deletion, and it is noteworthy that it has happened more than might be expected. Of course I understand that this is not my house, I consider it a privilege that a modicum of my posts are entertained, let alone allowed a home for posterity. Thank you Bruce. May the force be with you, and live long and prosper. Spock out.</p>
<p>Your frustration Clive is duly noted and appreciated, what might be insightful respecting the issues about censorial largess has yet to be revealed. Good night, and good luck. Peace out.</p>

On point, the speech given to the NRB by William Barr is still on the DOJ website. This speech gives a glimpse into how a movement (not a political party) sees the exercise of power, not just within the U.S. but around the world. This is a repudiation of democratic systems of governance and a blatant power and resource grab of epic proportions. Now, with a bit of sleuthing, the operative structural components are knowable. What has never been clear is any axiomatic or cogent thesis of how this &#8220;thing&#8221; operates. I can tell you it has a operational thesis not exposed to any critique or review and is completely antithetical to anything one might be familiar with in the sense of political theory. And if you understand it might be rational, you&#8217;d be wrong, even if just subjectively.</p>
<p>Funny, in an ironic way, the last sentence.</p>

				<p>@ name.withheld&#8230;,</p>
<p>Like you I&#8217;m greatfull to our host, what I don&#8217;t want to do is use my time in a way that hits the editing floor as it were. Something I suspect you have similar thoughts about.</p>
<p>But moving on,</p>
<blockquote><p>the speech given to the NRB by William Barr is still on the DOJ website.</p></blockquote>
<p>That speech was the final nail as far as I was concerned. The man is without doubt a mental aberration to the norms of society (as I&#8217;ve indicated in the past).</p>
<p>Like many such he has purpose, but more often than not it is alien to observers not of similar disposition. Which is what you are observing with,</p>
<blockquote><p>What has never been clear is any axiomatic or cogent thesis of how this “thing” operates. I can tell you it has a operational thesis not exposed to any critique or review and is completely antithetical to anything one might be familiar with in the sense of political theory.</p></blockquote>
<p>The nearest I could come to was the historic &#8220;King Game&#8221; and the reestablishment of &#8220;The Estates of Man&#8221;. All of which history shows move to failure over even a limited time frame.</p>
<p>But why do they fail, and have things changed in some way to actually make it viable longterm?</p>
<p>Well I suspect they fail due to &#8220;closed stud book&#8221; behaviours and lack of a productive excess that can be taxed and used to control.</p>
<p>The latter appears to have been solved as a side effect of mass technological development and availability.</p>
<p>Those of the WB / MP ilk, see that technology gives them both a lead and a gap in what they can do.</p>
<p>That is they have a time span of a half decade or so that they are out in front of society in general. As long as they can maintain that gap by various means, then they will achieve a new position. How viable it is long term I&#8217;ve not been able to draw any satisfactory conclusions to yet. To be honest though like you,</p>
<blockquote><p>And if you understand it might be rational, you’d be wrong, even if just subjectively.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find it too alien to even subjectively get a grip on. Which makes warning others difficult at best.</p>

<p>Having seen another of my comments disappear in the past 24 hours (not the one you noted Clive), I suspect there is another angle that I had not considered previously.</p>
<p>Besides being a hot topic, or controversial, or ongoing investigation, or sources and methods, it may be as simple as wanting to keep it out of search engines.</p>
<p>Zeus is missing the point.  It is not hubris, but communication.</p>

I've been writing about security issues on my <a href="/">blog</a> since 2004, and in my monthly <a href="/crypto-gram/">newsletter</a> since 1998. I'm a fellow and lecturer at Harvard's <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/bruce-schneier">Kennedy School</a>, a board member of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and the Chief of Security Architecture at <a href="https://inrupt.com/">Inrupt, Inc.</a> This personal website expresses the opinions of none of those organizations.</p>
