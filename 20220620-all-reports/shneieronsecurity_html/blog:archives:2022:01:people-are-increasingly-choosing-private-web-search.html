		<h2 class="entry">People Are Increasingly Choosing Private Web Search</h2>
		<p>DuckDuckGo has had a <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/online-privacy-duckduckgo-just-finished-a-banner-year-and-looks-for-an-even-better-2022/">banner year</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>And yet, DuckDuckGo. The privacy-oriented search engine netted <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/traffic">more than 35 billion search queries in 2021</a>, a 46.4% jump over 2020 (23.6 billion). That&#8217;s big. Even so, the company, which bills itself as the &#8220;Internet privacy company,&#8221; offering a search engine and other products designed to &#8220;empower you to seamlessly take control of your personal information online without any tradeoffs,&#8221; remains a <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/mobile/worldwide">rounding error compared to Google</a> in search.</p></blockquote>
<p>I use it. It&#8217;s not as a good a search engine as Google. Or, at least, Google often gets me what I want faster than DuckDuckGo does. To solve that, I use use the feature that allows me to use Google&#8217;s search engine through DuckDuckGo: <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang?q=!google">prepend &#8220;!Google&#8221;</a> to searches. Basically, DuckDuckGo launders my search.</p>
<p>EDITED TO ADD (1/12): I was wrong. DuckDuckGo does not provide privacy protections when <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/211591/whats-the-difference-between-using-duckduckgo-with-google-bangs-and-using-goog">searching using Google</a>.</p>

				<p>35E9 searches sounds like a lot.  But perhaps I do 10 searches a day (I do more), so 3.5E3/y so that&#8217;s 10E6 active users if &#8216;active&#8217; means 10 searches/day.  They have a survey mentioned in the article which says 27E6 people in the US use it so if you guess 35E6 globally that means 3 searches/day each perhaps.  Perhaps most people don&#8217;t search very much?  Or perhaps people say they use it but don&#8217;t very much.  Well, anyway, say about 30 million, so this is 1% of Facebook.  Which isn&#8217;t that bad, actually.</p>
<p>(Note I&#8217;ve used DDG for a long time &amp; I&#8217;m not disputing their numbers, I just wanted to work out what they mean as &#8216;searches/year&#8217; is not a very helpful number I think.)</p>

<p>All it does for me is redirect my browser to google.com.</p>
<p>I could just go there by myself if I wanted to, without involving DDG in the process.</p>
<p>How does that make my search private? I still end up on the google.com doing the search there.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no difference: DuckDuckGo doesn&#8217;t offer any privacy protection when redirecting the search to another result page with a !bang. E.g. !google foo (<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!google+foo" rel="nofollow ugc">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!google+foo</a>) just redirects to <a href="https://google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=foo" rel="nofollow ugc">https://google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=foo</a></p>

				<p><code>!g</code> is enough for google search, you don&#8217;t need to type <code>!Google</code>. And you don&#8217;t need to prepend the search with it, you can use it in any part of the query.</p>

				<p>I get the intent of !Google.  But this assumes I am using a browser where I am already identified to Google (i.e. Chrome), which means when the !Google hands off to Google, it&#8217;s no different from my searching in Google itself.</p>
<p>I use DDG browser for private searches (without logging into Google); I think if the concern is to hide search terms from G, it&#8217;s easier to do it in a separate browser entirely.</p>

				<p>Been using DDG for a long time now.  My understanding had always been that DDG used Google to do &#8220;your&#8221; searches.  The protection was that Google&#8217;s data collection would just point back to DDG and not you.  Of course, once you click on a link your ISP and or DNS now know where you&#8217;re going, TOR and VPN&#8217;s aside.</p>

				<p>I prefer Startpage, for privacy reasons, and have used it almost exclusively for years. Wasn&#8217;t happy about the sale of shares to that ad company, but at least Startpage is still directed and controlled by the original team, and I haven&#8217;t noticed anything sketchy yet.</p>
<p>I do use DDG occasionally, because sometimes Startpage throws up that stupid &#8220;Just checking&#8230;blah blah blah unusual activity&#8230;are you using a VPN&#8230;.&#8221; message, and refuses to go any further. (Duh&#8230;of course I&#8217;m using a VPN; doesn&#8217;t everybody?) But I don&#8217;t really care for DDG much.</p>

				<p>@ ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, once you click on a link your ISP and or DNS now know where you’re going,</p></blockquote>
<p>Is only part of the story&#8230;</p>
<p>For those using Google directly or not have you ever &#8220;moused over&#8221; those Google links to see what they realy are? Yup redirects through Google.</p>
<p>Have you ever checked where your DNS requests get sent? Yup Google or Cloudflare are most likely.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a few other wrinkles as well.</p>
<p>My big problem with DDG is that it works fine with short search terms but goes nuts with long search terms. Oh and a few issues to do with the use of double quotes&#8230;</p>
<p>Many years ago I learned and became very adept at using complex search terms, once you get the hang of them they are very very hard to give up (like a fine wine, single malts, or those better Belgium Chocolates 😉</p>

				<p>There are lots of other privacy-oriented metasearch sites available.  &#8220;Meta&#8221; meaning they don&#8217;t have their own crawlers; they use other crawlers like Google, Bing, etc.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a few:</p>
<p>SwissCows: <a href="https://swisscows.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://swisscows.com/</a></p>
<p>MetaGer: <a href="https://metager.org/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://metager.org/</a></p>
<p>Searx: <a href="https://searx.me/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://searx.me/</a> (federated, can be locally hosted)</p>
<p>Mojeek: <a href="https://www.mojeek.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.mojeek.com/</a> (has its own crawler)</p>
<p>Anyone that thinks StartPage is privacy-oriented is a little out of date.  They were bought by System1 in 2019, and unless System1 is the first advertising company to acquire technology and refuse to use it to further its advertising ends&#8230; then this &#8220;does not compute.&#8221;</p>

<p>That is my concern also. I&#8217;ve been using DDG for several years. It doesn&#8217;t take me to google(as far as I can tell). It&#8217;s set as my default search.<br />

				<blockquote><p>Anyone that thinks StartPage is privacy-oriented is a little out of date. They were bought by System1 in 2019,</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, that explains why they&#8217;ve become so privacy-hostile in recent years. They often reject searches from Tor users, and while they claim to want feedback about this, they stopped accepting it via web form (I complained about this when it first started) and want it only via email which I have no anonymous way to use. Google, of course, has been blocking &#8220;robots&#8221; (i.e. anyone they can&#8217;t build a dossier on) for a decade or more, which mostly rules out using &#8220;!g&#8221; for anyone who wants privacy; it works maybe 5-10% of the time, and with poor results compared to its glory days.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo supports searching via Tor—search &#8220;duckduckgo onion&#8221; there to get an official .onion address—but often gives bad results. I can&#8217;t count how many times I&#8217;ve put something in quotes and gotten pages that don&#8217;t include the phrase, sometimes don&#8217;t include one of the words at all. Bing always works, but not much better. Neither seems to support the &#8220;+&#8221; operator which Google used to, and don&#8217;t reliably support &#8220;-&#8220;. Sometimes they&#8217;ll return 0 results for some search that I know should have results, and then they&#8217;ll return results if I do the same thing with a site: operator (and I&#8217;m not talking about obscure pages—more like song lyrics easily found on fandom.com and elsewhere, for example). I&#8217;m reminded of Webcrawler, Hotbot, Lycos et al. in the late &#8217;90s, and I&#8217;m waiting for a Google to come along.</p>
<p>If you want alternate (possibly privacy-respecting) front-ends for various web services, try this list: <a href="https://github.com/mendel5/alternative-front-ends" rel="nofollow ugc">https://github.com/mendel5/alternative-front-ends</a><br />
They&#8217;ve got some for Google. The Twitter frontends are useful too, since the official page explicitly refuses to display anything for people with Javascript disabled (sad for a site originally meant to display 140 characters of plain text).</p>
<p>schneier.com&#8217;s preview button still has no effect, so let&#8217;s hope for the best&#8230;</p>

				<p>@Gordon,</p>
<blockquote><p>Sorry, but how can we be sure that DuckDuckGo won’t one day start selling our data?</p></blockquote>
<p>Tor&#8217;s not perfect, but they do support searching via Tor and without cookies (not even an annoying cookie banner)—even via an official Onion service, as I mentioned in my previous message. I treat that as a good sign, and a bit of a canary. If they disable the onion service, or start blocking &#8220;robots&#8221; or wanting CAPTCHAs or cookies, be suspicious. It&#8217;s generally considered reasonably difficult for an Onion service operator to learn the identity of a Tor user, even if (as some people think) the intelligence agencies can break it. Onion services also preclude exit relays as an attack vector, since none are used; this also means the operator can&#8217;t even pretend to geolocate the users, hopefully precluding any geographic legal restrictions.</p>

				<p>@Gordon You can&#8217;t be 100% sure, obviously.  The only way to be sure that a search engine isn&#8217;t collecting info about you would be to run your own search engine!</p>
<p>That said, you can never be 100% sure that <em>anyone</em> won&#8217;t turn on you at some point.  Some level of trust is a fundamental requirement of interacting with other humans.  If you decide that you don&#8217;t trust anyone enough to interact with them at all, well&#8230; that certainly is an approach to living life.</p>

<p>If you search DDG for anything that can be bought or sold, the first one or two &#8220;results&#8221; are paid ad placements, and plainly so. I haven&#8217;t seen more than two, yet.</p>

<p>Re: qutebrowser</p>
<p>Thanks for the heads up with that. It’s good to know there are options. Do you know how qutebrowser handles cookies? Also I wonder how linked these platforms are.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  qutebrowser uses QtWebEngine by default. QtWebEngine is based on Google’s Chromium.

<p>re: <i> What is it going to take for DDG to roll out a browser? </i></p>
<p>The money is not in the browser.</p>
<p>The money is in the search/sort/select databases on the back end.</p>
<p>DDG routes their searches through other engines, in theory stripping some identifiers from the query line.   DDG leverages the back end databases already in existence.</p>
<p>iirc(badly) There have been some bumps along the way because the back end databases want all the data; not just some of it.  There have been some dickering and horse trading in that regard.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s similar to the dickering and horse trading over news, news feeds and who gets to push the feed wagon.</p>
<blockquote><p> Twitter banned news aggregator:</p>
<p>[Site] grew rapidly over the last twelve months by aggressively aggregating news stories published and reported by mainstream outlets.

<p>Making a GUI isn&#8217;t nearly as interesting unless you have !COLOR TEMPLATES! as the primary attraction.</p>

				<p>@Ted, I&#8217;m not sure how qutebrowser&#8217;s  longterm cookie management can be manipulated. I use it for my &#8220;private&#8221; browser; it holds session cookies during a session: close qutebrowser and cookies vanish.</p>
<p>There is a whole tribe of browsers &#8220;based on&#8221; Chromium. I don&#8217;t believe many of them hold any allegiance to Ggl. BTW qutebrowser&#8217;s default home page is the DDG search page, altho&#8217; I prefer about:blank.</p>

				<p>Of course if companies which are given contracts to handle private data can&#8217;t get the basics of security right and design systems that are secure, and services they provide are not properly audited before they are handed the contract, then no one will have any privacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Cadence Health website only validated user input on the client side, not the server side, according to the hacker. This means that when a user accesses the tele-medicine site the normal way, by loading the site in their browser, they can only access their own data, but if they write a program that tries to access other data on the server, the server will respond with that data. The hacker simply asked the server for all patient data.&#8221;<br />

				<p>@tfb, I&#8217;m sure there are days where I don&#8217;t do any searches at all. Though I&#8217;m a person who mostly goes to the same sites and finds things directly from there.</p>
<p>For the most part, I find DuckDuckGo just fine. Google is maybe a little better with breaking news, DuckDuckGo has a more pleasing image search (lets you view the full image directly instead of going to the original page), Google Maps is much better (which I use for local stores), DuckDuckGo doesn&#8217;t feed me into a shopping section.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been using DuckDuckGo from early on I think. I am happily using it, and DDG seems to be adequate to my needs.</p>
<p>But, I can&#8217;t help but wonder if DDG is too good to be true. 😐</p>
<p>I trust nobody at all using my computer and I feel bad about using my computer most of the time. I wish I had a better impression of Linux, then I could keep using it. I am ofc ignorant about a lot of things, but I just wish things were better overall.</p>

				<p>@Clive re: &#8220;Many years ago I learned and became very adept at using complex search terms, once you get the hang of them they are very very hard to give up&#8221; &#8211; are you saying that you have the ability to do WWW searches using complex Boolean logic syntax arguments? One of the most disillusioning moments I have had on the web was when the search engine that best implemented that technique (Alta VIsta? Deja Vu?) went away (or stopped honoring that format, forget which). If that is the case, perhaps you could be so kind as to point to (or write 🙂 a guide on how to accomplish this. I, for one, would be most grateful.<br />

				<p>@marl et al re: DDG &amp; alternatives &#8211; I use DDG as one of my search front-ends. I find it adequate, mostly. The biggest issue I have is that on some searches it seems to return quite a number of results that contain what appear to be strings of Cyrilic characters as well as English, and also appear to link to a type of web page that has been constructed more-or-less dynamically to match the search terms. There is probably some specific name for that practice, but I don&#8217;t know what it is. That leads me to wonder if DDG isn&#8217;t prioritizing (or at least failing to filter) results leading to scam/phishing sites to create for themselves an alternative revenue stream to directly marketing user data. If that is the case, I don&#8217;t see a tremendous difference in ethics or practical effects on privacy between that and the Google approach. I use Ecosia and Qwant as well. I always use a VPN and frequently change my apparent location by changing the VPN server, so it is unlikely that localization is playing any consistent role in the results I regularly see. I also have JavaScript disabled when I search, that was my main criteria for choosing those three front-ends. I have been intending to implement dnscrypt but hadn&#8217;t yet bit the bullet. These comments have motivated me to download the pieces and I will now proceed to implelent, so thanks for that!</p>

				<p>@ Grima Squeakersen,</p>
<blockquote><p>If that is the case, perhaps you could be so kind as to point to (or write) a guide on how to accomplish this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately as you note Altervista is effectively no more and even Google is getting as dumb as a bucket of nails. You, I, and tens of thousands of librarians and other &#8220;information proffesionals&#8221; lament it&#8217;s passing and the dumbing down of systems.</p>
<p>The real reason it happened is &#8220;automation&#8221; a web crawler realy has no idea as to &#8220;content&#8221; and most web pages are not written to be indexed&#8230; So the result we have&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;just the facts ma&#8217;am, just the facts&#8221;</p>
<p>Crawlers should ignore most HTML tags.</p>
<p>It is too easy to inject junk into a webpage on the fly with PHP, and since the webserver can id the crawler, the webserver can poison a search engine on a selective basis.</p>
<p>Which is why you find a lot of junk.</p>

				<p>I hope this piece finds you all in excellent or improving health. May this year be a peaceful one for us all.</p>
<p>I use DDG too [rather dissatisfied with the insistent priority put on commercial links; the useful ones are often placed bellow sixth &#8211; but then it is “free”, I know&#8230;].</p>
<p>These days, I use Python libraries for a great deal of my web browsing and my own crawlers for lot of content aggregation/discovery pertaining to the universe of my interests. A lot of garbage is avoided this way [ads, common metadata and all that jazz]. If you don’t mind the effort and are data-inclined, you hardly need standard browsing software &#8211; or even search sites &#8211;  anymore.</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm, lurker, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>Crawlers should ignore most HTML tags.</p></blockquote>
<p>They dis and they didn&#8217;t depending on what bit of history you look at.</p>
<p>At one point web crawlers used to  have the same &#8220;disinherit&#8221; attitude as @lurker. Anyone overloading a page would actually get &#8220;derated&#8221;.</p>
<p>But the abusers trying to get up the rakings would use other tricks. I guess an &#8220;evolutionary process&#8221; in effect started and it was not long before the search engines effectively stoped &#8220;derating&#8221; by page &#8220;over&#8221; content but by other means such as the number of independent pages linked in. But that became ruined by the online equivalent of &#8220;log rolling&#8221; where a group of web sites would cross link each other.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s acrually a very hard problem to resolve which is maybe why it feels like they have &#8220;given up&#8221;.</p>

				<blockquote><p>In the olden daze, Google used links in a webpage as a constructive metric.<br />

<p>That&#8217;s an oversimplification. With PageRank, the value of a &#8220;page A to page B&#8221; link depends on the ranking of page A (and also decreases as the number of links on page A increases). In theory, that makes a link farm mostly worthless unless &#8220;important&#8221; pages link to it. So people will do things like post blog comments with links to the farm, or buy up reputable expired domains and replace them with farms, but these 2 specific examples would be relatively easy to guard against (e.g. by recognizing the HTML of popular blog software, and by tracking link appearance date vs. domain control changes). Links can still be a pretty good metric.</p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t get the impression that Google cares much about search spam. &#8220;Everyone&#8221; seems to know which sites are clogging up the results, and bitches about them—e.g., Quora now, ExpertsExchange in the past. One Google intern could knock out the worst offenders in a week and greatly improve results.</p>

<p>Note that the overbite plugin actually does do TLS, but just like dnscrypt, it is still going thru a proxy.  So, there is still a MITM.</p>
<p>Note: gophers (secure) protocol does not exist.</p>
<p>Also, the plugin has a bug/feature if you do not load from about:blank as it appears to be quite capable to leak parent page URL.</p>

&#8220;Just follow subject matter experts, or at least those that pay attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Follow journalist rules:<br />
1) One source is No source. Always have at least Two Independent sources.</p>
<p>2) An anonymous source is No Source. Look for someone whose name and background you can check.</p>
<p>3) Hearsay too is No Source. Go for the original witness.</p>
<p>If it involves anything scientific, it only counts if you find (and read) the peer reviewed publication. If there is no peer reviewed publication, it is just an anecdote. If it has not been reproduced by others, the result is tentative.</p>
<p>In this light, I hate it when newspapers do not link to the source of scientific news. When I find the research, it is not uncommon to see that the report does &#8220;not get it&#8221;.</p>

				<p>@ Winter, Bruce, SpaceLifeForm, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>If it involves anything scientific, it only counts if you find (and read) the peer reviewed publication. If there is no peer reviewed publication, it is just an anecdote. If it has not been reproduced by others, the result is tentative.</p></blockquote>
<p>The big problem with that is the academic community is both slow and very very patchy as well as playing &#8220;follow my leader&#8221;.</p>
<p>As can be seen from this blog, things discussed here take on average eight years to get published in a paper&#8230;</p>
<p>Then when you actually read the papers the authors are almost all young and it&#8217;s their first paper to a conference so is &#8220;novel&#8221; to atract attention of &#8220;best new paper committees&#8221;. They can do this as they have nothing to loose by not following a domain leader or current area of research.</p>
<p>To say academia in general has a &#8220;conservative outlook&#8221; is at best an understatment.</p>
<p>The research I do is frequently years ahead of what academia does, in some cases what I &#8211;and others&#8211; did back in the 1980&#8217;s is onky just appearing in academic papers. It&#8217;s not for want of knowledge, experience, or technology on academias part, in fact quite the opposit. It is the structure of academia that prevents them moving forward any faster than a gastropod on mogadon.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why I use other measures to evaluate, one of which is,</p>
<p><b>1, Do the laws of physics as we currently know them alow this?</b></p>
<p>If yes then I look for what they say are the</p>
<p><b>2, Indicative signals of causation</b></p>
<p>Which is what you generally search for when coming up with a hypothesis. I then look carefully at,</p>
<p><b>3, The claimed related effect or outcome</b></p>
<p>And,</p>
<p><b>4, The claimed method from cause to effect.</b></p>
<p>Are they valid? Are there other effects or methods that are valid? If so can they effect the results and have they been eliminated by the experimental method used to test.</p>
<p>Does this stop me being fooled, no, but it would take a lot of work to come up with a fraud that would get by such reasoning. And yes whilst some people have gone to the effort of deliberatly doing such things and managed to fool a lot of people in the process, in general when you find a bad paper &#8211;and there are a lot out there&#8211; it boils down to the researcher fooling themselves for a whole heap of reasons.</p>
<p>Oh and never ever trust a paper where the test subjects have &#8220;free will&#8221;. The clasic example was &#8220;Rats in a maze&#8221; experiments. For years papers came out with some quite extrodinary claims about behaviour etc. Well on scientist was doubtfull so did his own research&#8230; What he found was that the behaviour scientists experiments were all fundemebtally flawed. That is the equipment used was not upto the standard needed to carry out the experiments. The mazes did not eliminate from the five senses, touch, sound or smell all of which could be used by the rats as methods of navigation. He then built a maze to eliminate those senses and found when carrying out previous tests the results the behavioural scientists had written about, nolonger showed above random expectation&#8230; He went on to show that the most likely sense the rats were using to navigate was the sound of their feet on the maze base board&#8230;</p>
<p>So added a new meaning to the old expression of,</p>
<p>&#8220;The pitter patter of tiny feet&#8221;</p>
<p>Bringing chaos into an orderly house.</p>

				<p>@Clive<br />
&#8220;To say academia in general has a “conservative outlook” is at best an understatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you mean that academia wants to see evidence before it publishes, yes, indeed. Note that the better conferences nowadays do have peer review. The lead time for a conference paper is generally 1 year.</p>
<p>If you want quick results, you will have to accept quick disasters too. Peer review is often portrayed as a drag, but that ignores all the errors that are corrected in peer review. Whenever the peer review system fails, that means we get nonsense papers.</p>
<p>Also, the reason it is all the young people who write research papers is that they need to get a PhD and/or Post-Doc career. STEM papers are almost always collaborative efforts, sometimes with dozens of authors. In such a collaboration, the junior research are often assigned the first authorship as they need the citations most. If things go wrong, it is the last author(s) who are held responsible.</p>
<p>As for speed, you just have to look at the past two years in certain medical fields where results were published faster than anyone could read.</p>

				<p>@ Winter,</p>
<blockquote><p>If you mean that academia wants to see evidence before it publishes, yes, indeed</p></blockquote>
<p>No that is not what I am talking about, although that argument is often given as an excuse.</p>
<p>Academia is ferociously competative and your success in the research side is based on how much money you can pull in.</p>
<p>Part of being able to pull in money is to be a &#8220;leader in a field&#8221; where in some cases people will fall over themselves to offer you money.</p>
<p>How do you become a leader in a field well there are two basic ways,</p>
<p>1, Be the fields founder.<br />
2, Publish lots of related papers.</p>
<p>The two are quite interrelated.</p>
<p>But the publishing of papers is a big problem&#8230;</p>
<p>Journals tend not to touch new fields of research. There are several reasons for this but it boils down to if you are a &#8220;big name&#8221; or not. If I write a paper and try to publish it, the chances are it won&#8217;t get published on the &#8220;who he?&#8221; determinant. If however I give it to our host @Bruce and invite him to put his name on then the chances of it being published go up enormously.</p>
<p>The side effect of this is &#8220;under my wing&#8221; behaviour, that is you do the research for a big name and they put their name on the paper and you get it published. Do enough of this and you slowely get a name of your own.</p>
<p>But the downside is big names have a reputation to preserve, therefore they become very conservative in their outlook and very narrow of focus.</p>
<p>It takes a very brave &#8220;big name&#8221; to &#8220;branch out&#8221; into a new field.</p>
<p>But a second issue, is if you are the founder of a new field of endevor who can be found to peer-review your papers?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a chicken and egg situation.</p>
<p>I could go on but you can see the whole academic research side is actually designed to be against &#8220;new research&#8221; no matter what level you are at, just &#8220;incremental research&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which raises the obvious question of &#8220;How to change things?&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>As a side note, there is a museum to product design and market failure in Europe. It well documents the fact that in marketing well over 90% of investment in new products never shows a return to equalise the investment.</p>
<p>The actual return from investment in Scientific Research is hard to quantify as the returns tend to be predominantly &#8220;to society&#8221; not &#8220;to funders&#8221;. But we can clearly see just by looking around the room we are in or out the window that science without doubt has had a major and continuing repayment to just about everyone in society. So many orders of magnitude greater than the money &#8220;funders&#8221; provided to scientific researchers.</p>
<p>So perhaps the first way to answer the &#8220;How to change things?&#8221; question is &#8220;How to change the money flow?&#8221;. In the past governments have asked &#8220;big names&#8221; in Science and in &#8220;industry&#8221; in as authorative advisors. The results have always been bad, as basically they reflect what is best for the advisor not for either scientific research or society&#8230;</p>
<p>So as a second shot, maybe we should ask instead &#8220;How to change the way papers are published?&#8221;. Well the journals have such a bad name even &#8220;Nature&#8221; has realised it has to change. But there is so much money tied up in journals that change is at best nibbling around the edges which has caused all sorts of other issues.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I talk about the non proprietary research I do on this blog in general terms is to get past the nonsense that journals have become. Back if you like, to a time when science was at best young and researchers used to write to each other and discuse their ideas. Has it worked? Actually yes, I&#8217;ve been sited directly and the number of papers that can be easily seen to be about what I&#8217;ve discused is numbered in multiples of tens. Do I care that I don&#8217;t get credit, not realy as I&#8217;m not in that game. However I do care rather much about the effect on society, and I frequently wish there was a quabtifiable way of measuring it. Not for a monetary or similar reward[1] nor for status in other peoples eyes, no it&#8217;s just to be able to see that I&#8217;ve helped people even if they never get to know it. It&#8217;s one of the reasons I&#8217;m an &#8220;engineer&#8221; not a &#8220;scientist&#8221;[2] as I&#8217;ve indicated before.</p>
<p>[1] Though by me or our host @Bruce a drink even if it&#8217;s just a cup of tea would be nice, as I&#8217;ve said for quite a number of years now.</p>
<p>[2] Whilst scientists and engineers broadly overlap what they do, there is actually a difference in outlook. Scientists look for often abstract questions to answer, engineers look for answers to solve practical problems people have.</p>

				<p>I have completely moved all my searches over to DDG, and I am finding the results superior to google. This is particularly apparent if you use different computers that may have different google accounts/users logged in.<br />
At least on DDG you search for something and get a list of results, compared to google where the results are skewed to the proclivities of a particular user.</p>

I've been writing about security issues on my <a href="/">blog</a> since 2004, and in my monthly <a href="/crypto-gram/">newsletter</a> since 1998. I'm a fellow and lecturer at Harvard's <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/bruce-schneier">Kennedy School</a>, a board member of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and the Chief of Security Architecture at <a href="https://inrupt.com/">Inrupt, Inc.</a> This personal website expresses the opinions of none of those organizations.</p>
