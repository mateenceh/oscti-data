		<p>Here are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4l7Bdc6IFk4Gx_qZIM7Djfgq3qZNpPA1">six</a> beautiful squid videos. I know nothing more about them.</p>
<p>As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.</p>
<p>Read my blog posting guidelines <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/03/commenting_poli.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>EDITED TO ADD (2/25): This post accidentally went live on Wednesday, two days early, and people started adding their comments then. I have changed the posting date to the correct one, which means that the comments existing before that time will appear to have been made before the post. I apologize for the confusion.</p>

				<p>@ Abders, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>ARTEMIS</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s actually the result of &#8220;shrinkage&#8221; by advancments in technology&#8230;</p>
<p>Basically about half of what ARTEMIS does is similar to &#8220;rivet joint&#8221; which uses Boeing Airliner airframes.</p>
<p>There is however one thing we can not as easily shrink, and that is &#8220;Antennas&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>However as most of the interesting signals these days are at much shorter wavelengths than when rivet joint was first thought of, that is not as much of an issue as it might have been&#8230;</p>
<p>However the other half of ARTEMIS is problematic&#8230; Because it&#8217;s not &#8220;passive listening&#8221; but &#8220;active scanning&#8221; thus it emits quite a bit of high power RF which &#8220;pins it in the sky like a bug to a cork board&#8221;.</p>
<p>But ARTEMIS also has advantages over not just the Airforce rivit joint but all those satellites of the NRO that are vulnarable to anti-sat missiles we know Russia has&#8230;</p>
<p>You can not hide satellites, and they have highly predictable paths, and aside from limited &#8220;station keeping&#8221; very little maneuverability.</p>
<p>Satellites like navy &#8220;carrier groups&#8221; have had their &#8220;15 minutes&#8221; when it comes to active warfare.</p>

				<p>Ukrainian banking sector DDoS, VPNFilter, BlackEnergy, Industroyer, NotPetya, BadRabbit</p>
<p>The government today attributed the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the Ukrainian banking sector on 15 and 16 February 2022 to have involved the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). The decision to publicly attribute this incident underlines the fact that the UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity.<br />
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-assess-russian-involvement-in-cyber-attacks-on-ukraine" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-assess-russian-involvement-in-cyber-attacks-on-ukraine</a></p>
<p>In the attacks on the 2018 Games, the GRU’s cyber unit attempted to disguise itself as North Korean and Chinese hackers when it targeted the opening ceremony. It went on to target broadcasters, a ski resort, Olympic officials and sponsors of the games.</p>
<p>The GRU deployed data-deletion malware against the Winter Games IT systems and targeted devices across the Republic of Korea using VPNFilter.<br />
<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-and-partners-condemn-gru-cyber-attacks-against-olympic-an-paralympic-games" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-and-partners-condemn-gru-cyber-attacks-against-olympic-an-paralympic-games</a></p>
<p>FBI have previously attributed the Sandworm actor to the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate’s Russian (GRU’s) Main Centre for Special Technologies (GTsST). The malicious cyber activity below has previously been attributed to Sandworm</p>
<p>The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) assess that the GRU was almost certainly (95% +) responsible for defacing websites, cyber-attacks and interruption to TV channels in Georgia in October 2019.</p>
<p>The cyber programme responsible for these disruptions is known in open source variously as the Sandworm team, BlackEnergy Group, Telebots, and VoodooBear. It is operated by the GRU’s Main Centre of Special Technologies, often referred to by the abbreviation “GTsST” or its field post number 74455.</p>
<p>This is the first significant example of the GRU using cyber-attacks to disrupt or destroy since late 2017. This Unit of the GRU was responsible for:</p>
<p><code>BlackEnergy: December 2015 shut off part of Ukraine’s electricity grid, with 230,000 people losing power for between 1 to 6 hours</p>
<p>Industroyer: December 2016 shut off part of Ukraine’s electricity grid, also known as CrashOverride. It resulted in a fifth of Kyiv losing power for an hour. It is the first known malware designed specifically to disrupt electricity grids</p>
<p>NotPetya: June 2017 destructive cyber-attack targeting the Ukrainian financial, energy and government sectors and affecting other European and Russian businesses</p>
<p>BadRabbit: October 2017 ransomware encrypted hard drives and rendered IT inoperable. This caused disruption including to the Kyiv metro, Odessa airport, Russia’s central bank and 2 Russian media outlets<br />

<p>Russia launched cruise and ballistic missiles at airfields and military headquarters near Kyiv, the country’s capital city, according to Ukrainian officials. In the south, Russian troops landed in Odessa, according to Ukrainian officials.</p>
<p>In eastern Ukraine, Russian missiles hit targets in Kharkiv and Dnipro, according to Ukrainian officials, and loud booms were reported in Kramatorsk. Ukraine’s state emergency services said that attacks had been launched against 10 Ukrainian regions, primarily in the east and south of the country. Several planes were hit at airports, the statement said.<br />

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin would observe the drills from the Defense Ministry’s situation room and supervise the practice missile launches himself.</p>
<p>The ministry said it planned the maneuvers some time ago to check the readiness of Russia&#8217;s military command and personnel, as well as the reliability of its nuclear and conventional weapons.<br />

				<p>@ResearcherZero, All<br />
&#8220;Russian oligarchs Boris Rotenberg, Igor Rotenberg and Gennady Timchenko have been sanctioned by the U.K&#8221;</p>
<p>The Russian oligarchs experience the same problems as Walter White in Breaking Bad (or Pablo Escobar). They amass insane amounts of money that they cannot use in their home country. The profits in the economy of Russia are strongly tilted towards extractive industries, mining.<br />
ht-tps://credinform.ru/en-GB/Publications/Herald/8fd8420dda03</p>
<p>There is not much in Russia where the resulting income can be invested productively. Also, the Russians do not make that much stuff themselves, so much must be imported. Hence investments in industries that supply imports to Russia.</p>
<p>The gulf oil states have made a deal with the US and send them all their money. Russian oligarchs have little other places than London or the USA to invest their money, either direct, or indirect via tax havens.</p>
<p>That might make them vulnerable.</p>

				<p>Independent threat researcher Snorre Fagerland, working in cooperation with Bellingcat and The Insider, has identified a web service, apparently serving as a command and control centre, which has played a role in past cyber-attacks linked to Russian state interests.</p>
<p>The same website also hosted cloned copies of a number of Ukrainian government websites, including the main webpage of the Office of the President. Other cloned (and modified) websites found on the service include those of the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice and of a government-run petition portal. These cloned websites were created no earlier than November 2021, around the time when Russia’s latest round of escalations against Ukraine began.</p>
<p>Notably the cloned version of the site of the Ukrainian president is modified to contain a clickable “Support the President” campaign that, once clicked, downloads a package of malware to the user’s computer. It is not certain what the purpose of the malware payload is at this time, nor whether the payload was operational or simply a placeholder for different malware to be deployed at a crucial moment.<br />

<p>Russia is the world&#8217;s biggest producer of fertilisers.</p>
<p>Almost a quarter of the world&#8217;s ammonia exports are from Russia and it is dominant in materials like potash, urea and phosphates — we need those to keep producing food.</p>
<p>Russia is also a key source of most of the world&#8217;s nickel and palladium: minerals needed for smartphones, car parts, batteries and the world&#8217;s shift to renewable energy.</p>
<p>In any conflict, there are perverse outcomes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Australia is a commodity exporter, and we&#8217;re looking at a scenario where you could get a hefty increase in the price of a lot of the commodities that Australia produces,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it looks like it could be a mess for everyone, to greater or lesser degrees.&#8221;<br />

<p>Australia stopped exporting uranium to Russia in 2014, though it had little effect.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan is currently the world&#8217;s largest uranium producer, accounting for 38 percent of global output, followed by Canada with 16 percent. Australia accounts for 11 percent, despite having the world&#8217;s largest proven uranium reserves, the association&#8217;s figures indicate.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s Uranium One owned a 100 percent stake in Australia&#8217;s fourth-largest uranium mine, Honeymoon.<br />

&#8220;Russia is the world’s biggest producer of fertilisers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The question is why the oligarchs invest heavily outside Russia, while the influx of investments is much smaller?</p>
<p>In the USSR times, industrial output was worth less than the raw materials used as an input. Putin&#8217;s investments were most definitely not in improving the value added in industry. It shows.</p>

<p>Putin may think it&#8217;s easier to let everyone else do the work, then take what they have produced. It&#8217;s probably a hangover from the KGB mindset that developed from the time of Stalin. It worked to get him into power, and it worked to fill the pockets of him and his associates. Extortion is a popular technique employed by despots.<br />
Although Boris Yeltsin appeared to be running Russia from 1991 to 1999, perhaps behind the scenes it was a very different story. But Boris is no longer around to tell what really happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Russia’s leading foreign trade associations denounced a new law requiring an elaborate set of regular medical examinations for sexually-transmitted diseases and drug use for all foreigners who work in the country, including their family members as young as seven years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>Effective December 29, 2021, all foreigners working in Russia for a period of at least 90 days will have to meet new medical and identification requirements. They will be required to undergo quarterly comprehensive health examinations, including tests for sexually transmitted diseases, under a new law purportedly designed to improve health safety in the country.

<p>Fighting for territory, and locked in a Cold-War mindset where “If the West loses, we gain”, Russia’s spy agencies take extreme measures abroad – even assassinations. Their actions in the West may seem tactically effective but are strategically disastrous, painting Russia as an unpredictable threat.</p>
<p>European governments can moderate the agencies’ actions in their countries by adopting a tougher approach. This means investing not just in in counterintelligence but also addressing the governance weaknesses that facilitate the Kremlin’s campaigns, including placing tougher controls on their sources of dirty money.<br />

<p>the Kremlin said it would deploy nuclear-capable missiles to Kaliningrad and missile defense systems to Syria, announced “war games” in the Black Sea, said it was weighing new military bases in Cuba and Vietnam, and pushed an internal campaign for Russian officials to “get ready for war.”<br />

<p>Some modifications of the Iskander can hit targets 700 km (450 miles) away, putting the German capital Berlin in range of Kaliningrad, Linkevicius said.</p>

				<p>Devolution of U.S. Law and Foreign Policy<br />
My suspicion is Vladimir Putin is actively using the crisis in Ukraine as a dual purpose attack on western countries. First, by acts of aggression requiring sufficient responses to deter or prevent violent annexing of Eastern European countries keeps the political pressure and attention on the incursions of Putin. Second, the heightened activity is a ruse to other activities that are taking place outside the light of attention on Ukraine and constitute an indirect attack on states that will destabilize other country&#8217;s internal affairs. This is a multi-front, multi-pronged attack that will cause state level disruptions and potential conflict by internal populations sufficiently agitated by propaganda, personalities, and paid agents along with the media platforms to feed it. The working apparatus is already proven and is probably now considered battle grade and field ready for deployment. Tie this together with an electronic and cyber weapon operation and an extended field of battle, the methods to which one can imagine might keep countries very busy are not theoretical.</p>
<p>A most thorough and clear assessment of the current theater of operation, the operative environment, the weapons of choice, and a strategic understanding that can clarify and ready a response that may be necessary to deter or defeat a hybrid international war effort. DoD needs to pull clearances of former officials from the prior administration, force involuntary leaves of absence, do a full stand down of forces. All former political operatives brought in under the previous administration need to be suspended or relieved of duty.</p>
<p>What may not be obvious, when you are Donald Trump, and you haven&#8217;t succeeded, then there must be another way to accomplish a desired goal. If you can&#8217;t steal and election, maybe you can steal a country.</p>

				<p>@ Winter, ResearcherZero, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>The question is why the oligarchs invest heavily outside Russia, while the influx of investments is much smaller?</p></blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;ve not been reading this blog, as that question has already been answered.</p>
<p>But&#8230;</p>
<p>For several centuries Russia has been a parisitical Empire. It needed no industry, or economy, because by oppression and worse it stole from other nations.</p>
<p>Putin has done nothing productive to build the Russian economy, all he is doing is &#8220;strip mining the land&#8221; to bring in foreign currency that he then spends on enriching himself (40billion at last count) and several others such as corrupt officials like himself, Oligarchs, Russian mafia, and other criminals.</p>
<p>In order to stay in power at home he projects &#8220;strong Russia&#8221; with a fake history of the Rus, and achievements they never made. To many Rus have bought into this nonsence (a bit like &#8220;trickle-down in corrupt capitalist nations).</p>
<p>The Russian people have a stark choice, send there sons and daughters of to be cannon fodder in Putin&#8217;s imperial dreams of &#8220;Strong Russia&#8221; or realise the only hope to have great grand children with a future is to stop the &#8220;Strong Russia&#8221; nonsens, get rid of the corrupt officials oligarchs, mafia and similar and invest the money being stolen from them in education and industry.</p>
<p>If they did opt to build their economy, they would have in twenty years way more than Putin&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Russia&#8221; can ever bring them.</p>
<p>The danger is &#8220;sentimentality&#8221; for faux past glories, of arts and other high culture. The Rus never created it, it was all imported at the point of weapons from other nations they oppressed or traded with. But &#8220;sentimentality&#8221; is an infectious disease as deadly as any plague. You can see it developing in Germany where they are drinking in Putin&#8217;s fake history.</p>
<p>As for the corrupt politicians, oligarchs, mafia etc, the reason they keep there ill gotten gains out of Russia is two fold.</p>
<p>1, They don&#8217;t want to loose the power it gives them.<br />
2, To force multiply that power they do not want it building a Russian economy which would fairly quickly turn on them.</p>
<p>I hope that answers your question.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s how it&#8217;s done. Accuse everyone else of what you are doing. The GRU&#8217;s undeclared intelligence officers use exactly the same strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Putin has added an ideological element – Russia’s version of soft power. In alliance with the Orthodox church, Russian official propaganda lambasts multiculturalism, gay marriage and mass immigration, and claims to stand up for the family and traditional values against a decadent west that has lost its way and has tried to corrupt Russia.&#8221;<br />

				<p>@ResearcherZero<br />
&#8220;Putin may think it’s easier to let everyone else do the work, then take what they have produced. It’s probably a hangover from the KGB mindset that developed from the time of Stalin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much earlier. Since at least the rule of the Golden Horde (Tartars), Russia has been an extractive society of serfs and masters. Until Stalin&#8217;s forced industrialization, Russia was an agricultural society. Russia&#8217;s industrialization was forced into the old extremely hierarchical mold of society.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1990, there was an option to modernize industry. However, that had the disadvantage that a modern industry requires huge investments and an empowered work-force. Russia was also coming from far behind. However, oil, gas, and mining in general, can earn a fortune with little risks. That income can be entirely generated without the input, and influence, of locals, as the Gulf states proof. Which means that all the profits can end up in the pockets of the leadership. Which is what happened.</p>
<p>The fear and loathing of foreigners is also age old in Russia. All evil comes from abroad. They also tell aboriginals that life elsewhere is very good, which is not what the leadership wants their people to hear.</p>

				<p>@ ResearcherZero, ALL,</p>
<p>With regards,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;claims to stand up for <b>the family and traditional values</b> against a decadent west that has lost its way and has tried to corrupt <b>Russia</b>.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Those appear to be good things but they are not.</p>
<p>Firstly &#8220;the family&#8221; is always the point of attack against society carried out by religions and cults.</p>
<p>The purpose is to get at the very young through their mothers, and also turn the mothers into &#8220;breeding machines&#8221;. But also instill a rather nasty situation where the family is dependent on the cult for all social and often work activities. Therefore an individual that tries to defect has no family, work, friends, etc and becomes not just a &#8220;nobody&#8221; but an &#8220;outcast&#8221;. The &#8220;lockin&#8221; advantage of this insiduous behaviour is immense.</p>
<p>But remember also small children don&#8217;t lie, because their concepts of harm and betrayal are not developed. Therefore their &#8220;teachers&#8221; use them as spys on the family&#8230;</p>
<p>Secondly &#8220;Traditional values&#8221; is a compleate &#8220;crock of fertilizer&#8221; that burns and destroys rather than promotes growth. You see it in &#8220;ultra-conservatives&#8221; who still think humanity made a mistake giving up &#8220;witch hunting/burning&#8221;. It&#8217;s a way for them to give themselves &#8220;status&#8221; at the expense of everyone else. It&#8217;s about vanity used as a pupet for power. Look at it this way what did it cost a King to turn someone into a Baron or lesser noble? Next to nothing, but, the enobaled had fiduciary obligations to a King. So the person got the vanity status of a title that they had to pay for to keep. This turned the noble into either a fool if they were mainl narcissistic, or a useful tool if they were mainly psychopathic. It&#8217;s why all offices in the church above a certain level had to be approved by &#8220;the god head&#8221; of the King whi had &#8220;divine right&#8221;. The King ruled by maintaining a balance between the barons and the bishops. With both of those paying him, and keeping the populous under control.</p>
<p>What you are told are &#8220;Traditional values&#8221; are mainly faux nonsense, designed to keep you in servitude. One such is the almost modern nonsense of &#8220;The protestant work ethic&#8221; where you worked yourself into an early grave, keeping &#8220;your betters&#8221; in a lifestyle where there life expectancy was around twice that of the &#8220;workers&#8221;&#8230; The promise for your early demise, was &#8220;a reward in heaven&#8221; a purely invented concept to justify not giving those who produced the wealth a share of it&#8230; The modern version of this is now &#8220;rent seaking&#8221; where you as a worker are prevented from owning inflation proof or anti-inflation assets. To see why, if you own two houses, the first you live in, the second you rent out for the equivalent of the average working income, which means you get a comfortable life style without having to work&#8230; Each subsequent house you own gives you either a better lifestyle, or the abiliry ti by another house or other fiscal wealth generating assets. Oh there is a tipping point around five homes where the interest you pay on loans depreciates significantly and a second one, around ten homes where the excess income alone is sufficient to enable you to purchase another property without a loan&#8230;</p>
<p>The real value of inflation to those of status, is it keeps the poor poor and without assets, and them wealthy not in fiscal wealth but in real wealth of rentable/earning assets and with sufficient income that always rises at or above inflation.</p>
<p>Thirdly and importantly Putin&#8217;s message is not to &#8220;Russia&#8221; but the Rus, a disparat ethnic grouping that unfortunately have in many cases a sentimental outkook on a faux history of past glories, and what those glories could be again with a &#8220;Strong Russia&#8221; Empire. The reality of this stupidity can be seen with what has happened to Belarus (White Rus) and will happen to the Ukraine and anywhere else Putin can push his poison.</p>
<p>The thing about Empires is that only the self appointed have status thus wealth, the rest are conned by nationalism to become the cannon fodder to feed those of status in their wasteful power strugles against each other, where any wealth they obtain is wasted on buying &#8220;guard labour&#8221; and the like.</p>
<p>The reason Putin has 40billion stacked away, is not for his lifestyle or that of his family, but to ensure that he maintains his position to exploit not just those he despises as inferior or fools, but the &#8220;useful idiots&#8221; who keep the &#8220;fools&#8221; in check by oppressive means.</p>
<p>The problem is that the Rus fall for his stupidity, they actually welcomed his interferance in Belarus&#8230; And look what they got for their foolishness. The same is going to happen to those breakaway states after the party is over its back in the sweat-shops making wealth for Putin and Co&#8230;</p>
<p>With women relegated to the all important task of &#8220;baby making&#8221; so that there is sufficient new &#8220;cannon-fodder&#8221; coming through to oppress even more nations and their peoples&#8230; The thing is Empires are unstable, and colapse usually very quickly. There is no longterm future in &#8220;Strong Russia&#8221; it needs a functioning economy and it&#8217;s not going to have one as an Empire is almost always a patasite that ends up consuming not just the prey but it&#8217;s self&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Just to assure you, that was a rhetorical question.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Openers to psy-ops propagander and fake news etc&#8221;</p>
<p>To stop this if you ask a &#8220;rhetorical question&#8221; as an &#8220;opener&#8221; for making a statment, you must also answer it in a way that prevents others jumping on it for propaganda and fake news.</p>

&#8220;Firstly “the family” is always the point of attack against society carried out by religions and cults.&#8221;</p>
<p>Russia has legalized domestic violence (that is, man beating woman, not the other way around). This was done very much to the desire of the Russian Orthodox Church. That is the family they want. And that is also the type of family desired by all those Alt-Right guys.</p>

<p>$40B? That is an unlikely number.</p>
<p>It is more like $200B<br />

<p>Estimates vary widely:<br />
ht-tps://money.com/vladimir-putin-net-worth/</p>
<p>But this is all irrelevant. Putin has reinstated the patrimonial state in Russia: Everything in Russia is the possession of the leader, be it the Czar, Staling, or Putin. He literally &#8220;owns&#8221; everything in Russia. People who object, like Mikhail Khodorkovsky who once owned Yukos Oil.</p>
<p>So, what is the net worth of Russia? That is the real net worth of Putin.</p>

				<p>@Clive,</p>
<p>Respectfully, why did England build an enduring empire?  Even the UK is, to some extent, oppressive of the Welsh, Scots and Irish. For example, Thatcher would have failed without North Sea oil, and the City may take deposits from less than ethical sources. Heck, the Guardian says the Tories took millions in donations from Russian oligarchs. If your argument holds, why has England endured?</p>

<p>=Potential use cases</p>
<p>There are lots of potential uses for Secret NFTs aside from revealing never-before-seen scenes from popular films.</p>
<p>“The art community is alive with innovation and the media is actively exploring all the potential use cases associated with the technology,” Zyskind said.</p>
<p>In the art world, Secret NFTs could be used to set up private galleries, maintain financial privacy for artists, or conduct sealed bid auctions. Digital media could use Secret NFTs to create watermarked content or to protect exclusive or gated content.</p>
<p>Game producers could use Secret Network to create “loot boxes” with mystery content, deploy playable trading card games with hidden traits, or design role-playing games with enhanced strategic gameplay.</p>
<p>!!!!In the “real” world, Secret NFTs could be used to represent digital ID cards and passports with hidden personal information, receipts for luxury items and properties, and ticketing systems for events.=</p>

				<p>@ Canuck,</p>
<blockquote><p>Respectfully, why did England build an enduring empire?</p></blockquote>
<p>Enduring? Where is it today?</p>
<p>So no not enduring, also England did not want a &#8220;Parasitic Empire&#8221; as such it wanted &#8220;Protected Trading&#8221;.</p>
<p>And that sowed the seeds of it&#8217;s downfall.</p>
<p>Unlike the Roman Empire and the Russia Empire, England and to a lesser extent the other parts of what is now the union &#8211;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&#8211; existed to trade from at least as early as the bronze age (though there is apparently evidence of earlier trade in flint[1], some of which would have been cross sea as flint especialy when made into tools was once was a highly prized commodity). The trade routes in Europe even in what is effectively pre-history times went as far west as the south of Ireland and as as far east as what we now call the &#8220;stans&#8221;, Caucuses and down through what is modern day Turkey and Iran.</p>
<p>In Tudor times Henry VIII set up what is sometimes called the &#8220;first modern navy&#8221; to protect Britsh trading from the French, Spanish and to a certain extent Portugal. Then against &#8220;The Hoy Roman Empire&#8221; which was what the Roman Empire had morphed into.</p>
<p>From then onwards driven by religion Europe in particular France attacked the English trading and moved forces into places. Look at the history of India the British Government in no way wanted to run it, they knew the price of Empire was to high to sustain, but The French moved in to attack trading, they also did the same in the Americas which is actually the main reason that the USA exists and so does Canada.</p>
<p>Oh and the reason Scotland is &#8220;part of the Union&#8221; from 1707, well they decided they would play &#8220;merchant venturer&#8221; into the &#8220;new world&#8221; and botched it up so badly they bankrupted themselves. Thus Scottland got bought for a handfull of English Gold[2]. Contrary to much of the mumblings you hear, that it has always cost Scotland, some in Scotland did extrodinarily well out of it and the access to &#8220;world trade&#8221; that England had around 4/10ths of.</p>
<p>But what happened to the so called British Empire, well by 1900, the flag was setting, it cost to much to provide the security the members demanded. So bit by bit it morphed from an Empire to a Commonwealth which still exists. Perhaps it&#8217;s second greatest export was &#8220;Language and Law&#8221;, it&#8217;s greatest perhaps was &#8220;greed&#8221; by merchants and traders.</p>
<p>But the Napoleonic, Great and Second world Wars caused the greatest changes I&#8217;ve been into these before on this blog, but the posts got deleated for various reasons.</p>
<p>The lesson the US learned from the &#8220;British Empire&#8221; was not to have an Empire&#8230; But take a look, and you will see they do for what was once the same reason as the UK, to protect it&#8217;s trading. However the USA has a problem, it has burned through nearly all it&#8217;s natural resources within three centuries. Something Europe has still not quite done after 20 centuries. The result is that currently the US with 1/3rd of a billion people or a little under 1/24th of the worlds population[3] consumes upto 50% of the worlds resources according to some[4]&#8230; So ask yourself this &#8220;Does the US have a parasitic empire in all but name?&#8221; and &#8220;What is to become of it?&#8221;.</p>
<p>[1] Flint mining was a &#8220;colabarative activity&#8221; and as such formed the basis of an industry that produced trade goods, not just of raw flint but finished axe heads and similar. Why &#8220;industry&#8221; not just because of the nature of colabarative effort but because to eat and aquire other materials required those involved to be &#8220;paid&#8221; for their efforts. But also such activites developed not just an industry but a society,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293827758_Mining_and_Materiality_Neolithic_Chalk_Artefacts_and_their_Depositional_Contexts_in_Southern_Britain" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293827758_Mining_and_Materiality_Neolithic_Chalk_Artefacts_and_their_Depositional_Contexts_in_Southern_Britain</a></p>
<p>[2] <a href="https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/The-Act-of-Union/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/The-Act-of-Union/</a></p>
<p>[3] Depending on who you ask, the US population is 0.33 billion people, and the world population just over 7.9 billion so 7.9/.33 gives 23.94.</p>
<p>[4] I hate this figure because of the way various people come up with it. For instance I know that in some studies it&#8217;s a &#8220;cost to end consumer&#8221; figure, which is obviously not a like for like comparison. Even things that appear equivalent like &#8220;barrels of oil&#8221; are not realy equivalent, even gas/petrol to go in domestic vehicles is not equivalent as octane ratings show.</p>

				<p>Is the current situation on Russia&#8217;s southwestern border a continuation of the &#8220;game&#8221; played on its southeastern border nearly two centuries ago? Note that the new rules prevent revoking Russia&#8217;s seat on the Security Council: q.v. precedent US/Iraq. It would even take so long to draft an acceptable resolution to revoke their monthly chairmanship, that next month&#8217;s chairman would be in place before anytging happened&#8230;</p>

				<p>@ Winter,</p>
<blockquote><p>$40B? That is an unlikely number.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is and is not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s what investigation has shown to be atributable to Putin going through the UK.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s very much a low side figure for the UK, as for other parts of the world&#8230;</p>
<p>At the moment I&#8217;d rather stick with those minimum provable figures, that way any accusation of &#8220;falsehood&#8221; claims fails the wrong way for those making then.</p>
<p>But even so &#8220;if all could be seen&#8221; I would not be at all surprised if Putin&#8217;s &#8220;holdings abroad&#8221; well exceaded even the 200billion you mention. Certainly more than enough for him to buy one or two countries directly&#8230;</p>

<p>The cult &#8220;The Family&#8221; was lead by none other than a Russian spy. She kidnapped children in Australia and blackmailed politicians and high level bureaucrats.<br />
The GRU also kidnapped children in Australia, and used them for extortion.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>ESET discovered a new data wiper malware used in Ukraine</p>
<p>ESET telemetry shows that it was installed on hundreds of machines in the country. This follows the DDoS attacks against several Ukrainian websites</p>
<p>The wiper abuses legitimate drivers from the EaseUS Partition Master software in order to corrupt data. As a final step the wiper reboot computer<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1496581903205511181" rel="nofollow ugc">https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1496581903205511181</a></p>
<p>This blog includes the technical details of the wiper, dubbed HermeticWiper, and includes IOCs to allow organizations to stay protected from this attack.</p>
<p>analysis shows a signed driver is being used to deploy a wiper that targets Windows devices, manipulating the MBR resulting in subsequent boot failure.</p>
<p>The malware then focuses on corrupting the first 512 bytes, the Master Boot Record (MBR) for every Physical Drive. While that should be enough for the device not to boot again, HermeticWiper proceeds to enumerate the partitions for all possible drives.</p>
<p>They then differentiate between FAT and NTFS partitions. In the case of a FAT partition, the malware calls the same ‘bit fiddler’ to corrupt the partition. For NTFS, the HermeticWiper parses the Master File Table before calling this same bit fiddling function again.</p>
<p>The digital certificate is issued under the company name ‘Hermetica Digital Ltd’ and valid as of April 2021. At this time, we haven’t seen any legitimate files signed with this certificate. It’s possible that the attackers used a shell company or appropriated a defunct company to issue this digital certificate.<br />
<a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/hermetic-wiper-ukraine-under-attack/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/hermetic-wiper-ukraine-under-attack/</a></p>
<p>Symantec Threat Intelligence detected three organizations hit by the wiper malware — Ukrainian government contractors in Latvia and Lithuania and a financial institution in Ukraine, said Vikram Thakur, its technical director. Both countries are NATO members.</p>
<p>“The attackers have gone after these targets without much caring for where they may be physically located,” he said.</p>
<p>All three targets had “close affiliation with the government of Ukraine,” said Thakur, saying Symantec believed the attacks were “highly targeted.” He said roughly 50 computers at the financial outfit were impacted, some with data wiped.</p>
<p>&#8230;the malware’s timestamp indicated it was created in late December.<br />

				<p><b>Good news for some?</b></p>
<p>One of the defining markers of the pandemic for the tech industry was/is &#8220;Home Working&#8221; that further caused a slew of vulnarabilities for the ICTsec sector.</p>
<p>But what of the thing that underlies the entire tech sector &#8220;The workers&#8221;?</p>
<p>Some have claimed &#8211;and figures have shown there is truth in it&#8211; that they were more productive &#8220;working at home&#8221; (and there living expenses were less).</p>
<p>Others who have said less, have found &#8220;Home Working&#8221; to be quite stressful in two ways,</p>
<p>1, Feelings of &#8220;work&#8221; insecurity<br />
2, Complications in home life</p>
<p>Thus want to get back to the old ways of working even though they were more productive working at home.</p>
<p>Well it appears &#8220;Big-Tech&#8221; are going for &#8220;Office again&#8221; as we climb slowly out of the chasm the pandemic has become,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/technology/big-tech-offices.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/technology/big-tech-offices.html</a></p>
<p>I guess this will make some happy, others not&#8230;</p>
<p>But think of all the cats, that have adjusted to having their providers[1] around all the time to attend to their whims&#8230; Will they survive &#8220;Back to Work&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>[1] Contrary to what many think, &#8220;you don&#8217;t own a cat&#8221; they consent to live with you if and only if you provide them with enough of what they want. Studies have shown that some cats have &#8220;multiple homes&#8221; and which one they are in depends on the time of day, interestingly such cats appear to sleep less than the claimed sixteen hours a day of &#8220;the average cat&#8221;. Personally I&#8217;m not that keen on cats especially those that insist on making themselves &#8220;tripping hazards&#8221;, dogs appear to have more sense in this respect.</p>

				<p>In Kyiv, the government in 1993 went so far as to consider seizing operational control of its nuclear missiles and bombers. But that never came to pass.</p>
<p>Instead, Ukraine punted. It demanded that, in exchange for nuclear disarmament, it would need ironclad security guarantees. That was the heart of the agreement signed in Moscow early in 1994 by Russia, Ukraine and the United States.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>In late 1994, the pledges got fleshed out. The accord, known as the Budapest Memorandum, signed by Russia, Ukraine, Britain and the United States, promised that none of the nations would use force or threats against Ukraine and all would respect its sovereignty and existing borders. The agreement also vowed that, if aggression took place, the signatories would seek immediate action from the United Nations Security Council to aid Ukraine.</p>
<p>After Russian troops invaded Crimea in early 2014 and stepped up a proxy war in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin dismissed the Budapest accord as null and void.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Ukraine inheriting roughly 5,000 nuclear arms that Moscow had stationed on its soil. Underground silos on its military bases held long-range missiles that carried up to 10 thermonuclear warheads, each far stronger than the bomb that leveled Hiroshima. Only Russia and the United States had more weapons.</p>
<p>The removal of this arsenal often gets hailed as a triumph of arms control. Diplomats and peace activists cast Ukraine as a model citizen in a world of would-be nuclear powers.</p>
<p>At first, Ukraine rushed to get the Soviet arms off its soil. Bombs, artillery shells, land mines and the relatively small warheads atop short-range missiles were the easiest to relocate and most likely to fall into unfriendly hands. More difficult to move were the long-range missiles, which could weigh 100 tons and rise to a height of nearly 90 feet.</p>
<p>In January 1992, a month after the Soviet Union ceased to exist, Ukraine’s president and defense minister ordered military commanders and their men to pledge loyalty to the new country — a move that would exert administrative control over the remaining arms. Many refused, and the soldiers who managed Ukraine’s nuclear forces fell into a period of tense bewilderment over the fate of the arsenal and its operational status.<br />

<p>Yesterday morning I awoke to an almighty bang on the roof, and found a rat with no testicles. The local hawk was flying above and the local black cat was sitting nearby in the early morning darkness.</p>
<p>I asked them both, &#8220;Alright, which one of you two ate his balls?&#8221;</p>
<p>They both refused to answer.</p>

				<p>@ ALL,</p>
<p>The writer Igor Ljubuncic who describes himself as,</p>
<p>&#8220;A physicist by vocation and a Linux geek by profession.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who has spent a decade and a half writing some of the better information articles on technology (you can find on his dedoimedo.com site). On reading the Win11 must be online nut§¥€kery, he has decided that enough is enough with Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;everything in the cloud&#8221; lunacy. So has decided he is voting with his feet and moving away from it.</p>
<p>Like many writers he &#8220;has to use MS Windows and Office&#8221; because that is what the industry wants[1]. Oh and he also &#8220;plays games&#8221;&#8230; Thus his aim to get off the whirly-goround is going to be less onerous than for some[2].</p>
<p>So he&#8217;s started a new project, to migrate off of MS lunacy in the period Win 10 is still officially supported,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/windows-moving-away.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/windows-moving-away.html</a></p>
<p>In the past when I&#8217;ve had to bring work/information into my personal environment I&#8217;ve always used non binary &#8220;ASCII based files&#8221; to go through &#8220;security sanitation&#8221; to &#8220;cross the gap&#8221;[3].</p>
<p>But what many forget is &#8220;their legal duty of care&#8221; with respect to information and it&#8217;s confidentiality  means they can not use the &#8220;cloud&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just US legislation of HIPAA-1996 SOX-2002 PCI-2004 or that of the EU GDPR etc you have to complie with, that &#8220;can NOT be done in cloud applications&#8221;&#8230; It&#8217;s also the likes of NDAs and Professional Duty of Confidentiality that so many in the legal, medical, accountancy professions are not thinking and acting upon that should stop them using Cloud Applications.</p>
<p>[1] I&#8217;ve run into this nonsense on more than my fair share of occasions. I don&#8217;t use MS OS&#8217;s beyond XP for what I do, and I still use a text editor come very early Word Processor called WordStar. In part because it&#8217;s a tool I grew up with and it is the basis of most of the interfaces to languages I wrote programs in that I still decades later support. But also it has a well defined file specification that I&#8217;ve written what must be hundreds of programs/scripts/tools to work with many under &#8220;other OS&#8217;s&#8221; because yes WordStar does run under all the DOS Emulators on *nix I&#8217;ve tried as do most of the programing languages. Yes I have MS office from the 1990&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the least painful way to generate RTF files. As for MS Office files I get sent, well there were tools to turn their custom file formats into either RTF or PDF format that I could then work with, but these tend not to be needed these days.</p>
<p>[2] Outside of my personal environments, I have to run Engineering and Production software (what was once called CAD/CAM). Much of this type of software was only ever written for &#8220;MS WinDoze&#8221;, but Wine has run quite a bit of it. Thankfully though many of these programs use standard file formats that will work with software that runs on non MS environments.</p>
<p>[3] Whilst few think about it your effort and &#8220;Intellectual Property&#8221;(IP) exists &#8220;in the files&#8221; applications use. If these are &#8220;standard&#8221; or you only use &#8220;standard&#8221; file formats &#8211;lowest being TXT, CSV, RTF, HTML, etc&#8211; then migrating to non MS Win platforms or applications becomes possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;If these are “standard” or you only use “standard” file formats –lowest being TXT, CSV, RTF, HTML, etc– then migrating to non MS Win platforms or applications becomes possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>I stick to standard formats that are interoperable, as it makes things much easier and simpler to work with.</p>

				<p>@Clive</p>
<p>Thanks for the link!</p>
<p>It ties in with some other papers from different HIP-RIP-LICOV countries where it&#8217;s all about their &#8220;new normal&#8221; and nothing at all about people who&#8217;s normal wasn&#8217;t the same under the &#8220;old normal&#8221;.</p>
<p>Your neck of the woods isn&#8217;t doing too well on that score either from my reading.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve did some diving into the genome pool and the major 2 lakes are still Delta and Omicron but there&#8217;s some &#8220;odd ducks&#8221; in puddles here and there.</p>
<p>Locally the Omicron Wave 4 is retreating. The death rates will be trickling in slowly.  Like other LICOV governments, I expect a serious reduction in public facing information to happen soon.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s been interesting to monitor MSM responses to Government NUDGE=PUSH to drop COVID off the front pages onto page 2 or 3 with only short paragraph articles. Even MSM that have rep-cred as independent news, toe the new line on LICOV.</li>
</ul>
<p>As more articles start pushing LICOV and have transitioned from the word &#8220;RISK&#8221; to the word &#8220;GAMBLE&#8221;; there&#8217;s a trend to &#8220;blame the victim&#8221; for wanting to stay alive.</p>
<p>My not very good predictions:</p>
<p>a) A false-bottom out of the numbers until May-June 2022<br />
b) A slow slow rise as the false bottom levels out<br />
c) Wave 5 (Western USA) starting Q3</p>
<p>Wave 5 will be worse from several aspects<br />
1) The no-vax/no-mask folks will be frolicking about for months<br />
2) The reduction or nil reporting<br />
3) The continued collapse of health care systems in economically advantaged countries where the systems will be expected to handle continuous surges every 2-3 months.<br />
4) The continued failure of any significant global vaccine program<br />
5) The continued lockout of access to systems and supports for people without means to interact with fully automated, no person, AI/ML, decision tree systems.(1)</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>1) I&#8217;ve now have run into two full walls of required automated system with no contact and where the required data in N/A.  I won&#8217;t be getting on a plane anytime soon anyway but getting shut out of US Federal Buildings where Social Services are located might be &#8220;problematic&#8221;. The other wall is being required to show up Face2Face with a fist full of documents that are N/A, isn&#8217;t going to make my menu look any better.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve determined there isn&#8217;t anything I can really do to alter either of these. To paraphrased a quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“eating v heating”<br />
“eating v meeting”<br />
“eating v living”
</p></blockquote>

				<p>A group of Ukrainian border guards who were killed while defending a strategic Black Sea island on Thursday gave a defiant final message to their Russian aggressors, according to an audio recording of the incident.</p>
<p>The 13 guards stationed on the remote Zmiinyi or Snake Island were informed by a Russian warship via loudspeaker that they should surrender or “be hit with a bomb strike”.</p>
<p>“Russian warship, go f*** yourself,” was their leader’s reply.<br />

				<p>Details of the next round of European sanctions were still a work in progress but the European Union is expected to freeze Russian assets in the bloc and halt its banks&#8217; access to European financial markets as part of what EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell described as &#8220;the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented&#8221;.</p>

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing,</p>
<blockquote><p>Your neck of the woods isn’t doing too well on that score either from my reading.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of times we&#8217;ve been &#8220;The Dirty Man of Europe&#8221;.</p>
<p>You would think from the figures that catching Omicron would be as easy as putting your hand out for a bus&#8230;</p>
<p>The UK Gov has in the past sent me several letters saying I&#8217;m Special, thus need to do more than self isolate&#8230; But, when it comes around to me getting a booster shot&#8230; Apparently I&#8217;m too special to have one, as they go all twitchy when they look up my medical records and see I got a body full of blood-clots well within 28days of having my second jab. Apparently I need what they call a third shot, which requires a letter of authorisation that for some reason I can not get.</p>
<p>So my only option before a new varient with greater killer instincs comes along is to catch Omicron&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>4) The continued failure of any significant global vaccine program</p></blockquote>
<p>Was always going to be the case, even now &#8220;production exceeds demand&#8221;.</p>
<p>But the real question is &#8220;Are these vaccines now of any real use at the price?&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>The mRNA vaccines realy can not be used outside of first world infrastructure, we&#8217;ve known that since before those vaccines were in stage one trials. The adenovirus vaccines like Oxford AZ are apparently nolonger available even though they have a broader protection profile. But what of Sinovax and similar traditional vaccines of inactivated live virus that should have the broadest covarage of any vaccine&#8230;</p>
<p>Which to be honest looks like it should be the better option for a booster shot as you get the &#8220;full skirt covarage&#8221; close to natural immunity, than the now significantly failing &#8220;dressless evening strap covarge&#8221; of an mRNA jab.</p>
<p>You note the press are not talking about booster shots any longer. But even in the first world we should be asking &#8220;what is the cost trade off?&#8221; now that the effectiveness of a booster is down around 10weeks and each successive shot will be less effective.</p>
<blockquote><p>but there’s some “odd ducks” in puddles here and there.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, and they concern me. It&#8217;s entirely possible someone with no immunity could get say both Delta and Omicron together and as a result produce a jump mutation to a new varient&#8230; Likewise those disease reservoirs in high metabolic rate mammals like rodents that gets a zoonotic transfer. So the new varient has say the same or higher infectiousness as Omicron but the lethality of say MERS, but is ignored by vaccine produced antibodies so to those who are only vaccinated by mRNA or other narrow skirt coverage vaccines it would be effectively novel again&#8230;</p>
<p>Which brings me onto an old issue nobody has talked about, but realy should. Disease mutation and rapid spread frequently happens in armed conflict. Now that war across much of Eastern Europe is likely, and if not choked back, will likely embolden others to &#8220;invade&#8221; other nations in other parts of the world&#8230; It won&#8217;t just be the bank of mum and dad&#8230;</p>

<p>Be carefull, even though doing things for good, it won&#8217;t stop you being a criminal under many Western First World national legislation.</p>
<p>So remeber, you can knock on the door and tell others who answered or not, but gaining entry without consent, even if it is just to &#8220;look around&#8221; is worse than trespass in the real world.</p>

<p>re: <i>“go f*** yourself” </i></p>
<p>This is a commonly reported phrase in war times, most of the time with great emphasis added.  Of course, it&#8217;s used frequently outside of war too these days.</p>
<p>My favorite rendition was from the rare survivor of the CIA backed, funded, trained (in the USA) and equipped invasion(s) of Tibet.  Probably something few remember or want to remember, as it was unsuccessful from the CIA PoV.</p>
<p>In a video documentary, the survivor of one of the CIA backed guerrilla incursions into the Upper Mustang, Nepal described how they setup on a tall peak and shot down at the Chinese, as the Chinese struggled to climb up from the valley below. When they ran out of ammunition, they hurled rocks and ice clods.</p>
<p>The battle cry was <b>&#8220;EAT SHIT!!!&#8221;</b></p>
<p>It was a very thrilling rendition in Tibetan.</p>

				<p>&#8216;E-nose&#8217; could someday diagnose Parkinson&#8217;s disease by &#8216;smelling&#8217; skin<br />

<p>&#8220;Scientists have been trying to build devices that could diagnose Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) through odor compounds on the skin. Now, researchers have developed a portable, artificially intelligent olfactory system, or &#8216;e-nose,&#8217; that could someday diagnose the disease in a doctor&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>The researchers developed an e-nose, combining GC with a surface acoustic wave sensor &#8212; which measures gaseous compounds through their interaction with a sound wave &#8212; and machine learning algorithms.&#8221;</p>
<p>This technology may be utilized for test of drug usage, gun powder exhaust, etc. for security puposes as well.</p>

				<p>Drones armed with a small microwave weapon can shoot down other drones<br />
<a href="https://www.epirusinc.com/news-item/drones-armed-with-a-small-microwave-weapon-can-shoot-down-other-drones" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.epirusinc.com/news-item/drones-armed-with-a-small-microwave-weapon-can-shoot-down-other-drones</a></p>
<p>Technology startup Epirus, which is competing with Boeing Co (BA.N) and others to supply drone-zapping weapons to the U.S. military, has raised $200 million in a private transaction that lifts its valuation to $1.35 billion, the company told Reuters.</p>
<p>&#8220;The  cash infusion comes as the United States scrambles to develop  countermeasures against widely available commercial drones that military  and law-enforcement officials say pose mounting tactical threats to  everything from military bases and refineries to mass gatherings like  Sunday&#8217;s NFL Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Militias  and insurgent groups including Islamic State have rigged off-the-shelf  drones with explosives to attack high-profile targets including  commercial ships and armored combat vehicles.</p>
<p>Last  month, Iraq&#8217;s air defenses shot down two explosive-laden drones as they  approached the Ain al-Asad air base, which hosts U.S. forces, west of  Baghdad.</p>
<p>&#8220;I  am very concerned about it,&#8221; Marine General Kenneth McKenzie, the head  of U.S. Central Command,told a congressional committee last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Small,  commercially available drones are one of the most persistent and  dangerous threats that we see in the (Middle East),&#8221; McKenzie said.</p>
<p>The  proliferation of cheap drones has raised the need to find an  alternative to traditional aerial defenses, such as surface-to-air  missiles, which can cost $3 million apiece.</p>
<p>Torrance,  California-based Epirus joins a number of aerospace juggernauts  developing so-called directed-energy weapons of varying size and cost  that zap unmanned aerial vehicles using lasers or microwaves.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was not espousing offensive hacking. I recommend to let those in best position to do such, decide.  They may decide not to due to strategic reasons.</p>
<p>What I was pointing out is that GreyNoiseIO is providing a list of attacking ip addresses, which can be used in a defensive posture at router/firewall level.</p>
<p>Maybe they just DROP (my choice), but maybe they could be creative and return http error 418.</p>

				<p>@SpaceLifeForm @Clive @ALL</p>
<p>Then again, we are not living in ordinary world anymore.<br />
I never realized a real war in Europe in 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;5 NATO decided last night to supply “all weapons, Ukraine asks for though it might be too late”The supply has started and Germany is not one of the nations.Let’s guess who stepped up then. Baltic x3 + UK + Poland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, Germany even didn&#8217;t agree us to give our old D30 to UKR (those<br />
that we got from DDR).</p>
<p>But we gave to UKR Javelins and they already used them for the<br />
right purpose.</p>
<p>Sorry, violent/graphic content. But this is a war.</p>
<p>hxxps://twitter.com/XyKyiv/status/1497262631924600832</p>
<p>Our next batch of Javelins is on the way to UKR.<br />
We brought those against RU tanks, now they are used<br />
for exactly the same purpose.</p>
<p>However hacking RU &#8211; US already has all the right intel,<br />
from satellites to all those secret NSA project codenames,<br />
troop location, all communication recordings, all attack plans.<br />
They just need to give this intel to UKR. ASAP. For once<br />
all those secret &#8220;codenames&#8221; can be used for right purpose,<br />
for freedom and democracy, against the real evil.</p>

<p>Antigonish</p>
<p>About 2 to 3 days ago, I saw this problem occur.  Then, it went away.  Today, I am seeing it again.</p>
<p>As the domain discussed previously (see end of prior squid), actually is functioning as a work-around for this problem, I can only conclude that what twitter said is not accurate.</p>
<p>You do not have to think too far outside the box to figure out what is going on.</p>
<p>I am not going to describe for security reasons.</p>

				<p>@ Bruce, and the usual suspects,</p>
<p>Some years ago I pointed out that,</p>
<p>1, As you type spell checking leaked your typing cadence in your device.<br />
2, As you type suggestions on Google and other search sites leaked your typing cadence to their web sites.</p>
<p>Both are security vulnerabilities that are effectively ID Biometrics.</p>
<p>Since then things have changed&#8230;</p>
<p>Whilst the first appears &#8220;limited&#8221; to your device, with Smart Devices you do not actually own, such information can be communicated &#8220;off device&#8221; without your knowledge via telemetary and the like. So they now both leak biometric data about the user to the OS owner or others who know how to write applications to get the biometric that will Identify you.</p>
<p>Seconfly we don&#8217;t call them web sites any longer but &#8220;the cloud&#8221;. The reality is the cloud takes in way way more than just search terms these days. So the ID Biometrics are significantly larger, but also give insight into how you think and reason.</p>
<p>Which brings us to</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kolide.com/blog/is-grammarly-a-keylogger-what-can-you-do-about-it" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.kolide.com/blog/is-grammarly-a-keylogger-what-can-you-do-about-it</a></p>
<p>Grammarly is way way more than a keylogger, it can identify you with as little as a paragraph of your writing and much about your personality, reasoning, education level, proffession, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>So that old Cardinal Richelieu,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men, I will find something in them which will hang him.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Needs a little update to perhaps,</p>
<p><b>If you give me six lines written by the anonymous hand of the most honest of men, I will find something in them which will identify and hang him&#8230;</b></p>
<p>Oh and despite the likes of Tor, the cloud realy does know where the device you use &#8220;connects&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Just something to remember now Putin&#8217;s people are threatening Finland and Sweden with the same fate as the Ukraine (ie to become another Belarus).</p>

				<p>@ ALL,</p>
<p>Just one thing I forgot to say in my above about &#8220;typing cadence&#8221; as de-anonoymising Biometric.</p>
<p>The usual HTTPS / SSL and other data protection security will not stop the typing cadence being visable to anyone who can see your packets on the wire.</p>
<p>As discussed several times by @SpaceLifeForm, myself, and others, the &#8220;Border Gateway Protocol&#8221;(BGP) is in no way secure. Nore are underlying physical network protocols like SS7.</p>
<p>So a &#8220;Nation State Level&#8221; agency, or a myriad of smaller corporations and companies, can send your packets that reveal your Biometric thud your ID through or to any part of not just the Internet, but any part of the underlying physical layer you can not see, the globe spaning &#8220;telephone&#8221; network.</p>
<p>To stop this attack, you have to disable &#8220;interactive communications&#8221; at the character level. With the likes of the Google search entry box, turning off &#8220;javascript&#8221; limited any cadence to when you pressed the enter key. However to use Google, you have to have both javascript and cookies enabled.</p>
<p>The solution of using DuckDuckGo does not stop the biometric unless you have javascript turned off because it&#8217;s &#8220;helper&#8221; works on a caracter by caracter basis so your typing cadence still goes out on the wire and to DuckDuck, where it may be forwards onto.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned before HTML5 has a lot of &#8220;extensions&#8221; that you don&#8217;t need but alow those providing servers to collect lots and lots of information, not just about your computer so it is uniquely identified, but also about you the user so you are also uniquely idetified.</p>
<p>The thing is that whilst the computer can be to a certain extent &#8220;hidden on the wire&#8221; by encryption, your character by character typing cadence that identifies you can not be hidden by encryption.</p>
<p>As we have entered a &#8220;Global information war&#8221; that now also has a significant &#8220;kinetic component&#8221;. The instigators of which, are known to be drawing up &#8220;Hit Lists&#8221; of what they see as &#8220;Undesirables to be Neutralized or Dissapeared&#8221;.</p>
<p>People need to consider their &#8220;Personal Security&#8221; as it effects not just them, but their family, loved ones, friends, colleagues and others in clubs, Churches etc.</p>
<p>A look at what had happened to Belarus will tell you what future you will have if certain peoples plans and ambitions come to fruition.</p>
<p>Oh and remember Belarus was and presumably still is quite a bit behind in the communications and IS/T infrastructure than many Western First World Nations. So &#8220;the states&#8221; capabilities there are more limited than the US, UK, and most central and western European nations (and other places like Australasia and a number of Asian nations).</p>

				<p>@ Ismar, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>Can anyone here confirm (or otherwise) if accounts listed on this page would be what they claim to be</p></blockquote>
<p>I do not wish to stop honest charity, it&#8217;s one of the things that makes humans human.</p>
<p>However as I&#8217;ve found over the years many even reputable &#8220;charities&#8221; say one thing and do another with the donations they receive.</p>
<p>Then there are those that are dishonest if not down right evil. Where money moves, there will always be criminals and confidence tricksters thousands of years of history show that. But technology has enabled new evils to flourish, we know that charities are setup and used by money launderers, drug cartels, organised crime, inteligence services, and importatly terrorists.</p>
<p>So consider, once your money has left your hand you have no future control of it, which may not be an issue for you. But what about the information about the donation? In this modern age where every non &#8220;cash in hand&#8221; transaction is recorded indefinitely and where some making charitable donations have been prosecuted for aiding terrorism in the US and other Western Nations in Europe and else where, do you realy want it on record you have made a &#8220;donation&#8221;?</p>
<p>I therefore urge you to think carefully not about if to make or not a donation, but &#8220;HOW you make the donation&#8221; if you do.</p>

<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of organizations that are asking for assistance. Donations can be made through the links to their websites or social media pages.<br />

<p>The Red Cross has a permanent presence in Ukraine and directly assist in medical aid also.  They usually have a fund set up in the case of large emergencies and also have outlets in most places, which is one way people can contribute with cash if they don&#8217;t want their details recorded.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Ombudsman says agencies still break data interception laws</p>
<p>There remains insufficient or inconsistent processes for vetting and quarantining of stored communications, as well as how agencies use and share stored communications, the report said.</p>
<p>The ombudsman also found non-compliance with requirements for destruction of stored data, and agencies can still mishandle preservation notices.</p>
<p>As for telecommunications data, the office found journalist information warrants were misused, and there was an issue with “sufficient seniority of authorised officers” (that is, personnel requesting metadata from carriers and service providers).</p>
<p>The report identified the Department of Home Affairs as delegating telecommunications responsibilities to people without sufficient seniority.</p>
<p>The report says: “we recommended the Department revise its s5AB(1) authorisation under the Act to remove APS Level 6”, instead limiting authorisations to management positions. “The Department did not accept this recommendation,” the report noted.</p>
<p>The report also said the Department of Home Affairs could not identify whether it had received any unauthorised data, and couldn’t demonstrate that it could “appropriately manage any use and disclosure that may have occurred.</p>
<p>The report highlighted a particular example: Home Affairs made a telecommunications authorisation covering multiple persons, but omitted the service numbers covered by the authorisation.</p>
<p>As a result, the ombudsman’s report found, “we could not determine what was authorised and were not satisfied these authorisations were properly made”.</p>
<p>The Department was unable to explain why this happened, the report said.<br />

<blockquote><p>What about Putin? Would he be willing to give his life for his people?</p></blockquote>
<p>A rhetorical question&#8230;</p>
<p>But I will answer it any way,</p>
<p>I rather hope Putin would give his life for the Russian people, the faster the better.</p>
<p>Why because it would I hope for a little while kill off his &#8220;Strong Russia&#8221; nonsense, that is killing not just Russian&#8217;s but other people needlessly.</p>
<p>What Putin want&#8217;s will be the ruination of Russia and bring death and destitution on it&#8217;s people, of that there is no doubt. The wheel of history has turned and crushed previous Russian Empires several times. It would be the madness of a psychopath to think the wheel would not turn again with the same result.</p>

<p>Being completely biased, as I have met Putin, I&#8217;d say he did sneak away after doing dodgy stuff to his own people in a Russian embassy. He didn&#8217;t front the music, instead he skipped town. So in answer to your question, probably not, but you&#8217;d have to take account of his other actions to have a more informed view. His cohorts were also a little psychopathic, but that does not necessarily imply that Putin is.</p>

<p>Hmm times have changed from</p>
<p>King Richard III : &#8220;A horse, a horse, my Kingdom for a horse!&#8221;</p>
<p>Admittedly he wanted it to give him a higher position to ride through the frey to seek his real enemy and destroy him.</p>
<p>Kind of like wishing for a B2 bomber to go drop a message of &#8220;love&#8221; &#8211;just as pigeons do&#8211; on Putin&#8217;s head, but by a few megatonnes more than a pigeon 😉</p>

&#8220;His cohorts were also a little psychopathic, but that does not necessarily imply that Putin is.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, but there is little difference in his actions. He &#8220;won&#8221; his first elections by executing a false flag bomb terror campaign that killed 300 Russian civilians.<br />

<p>Then we have the many murders and poisonings. His actions in Cheznya and Syria were even worse, much worse.</p>

				<p>The FBI, the CIA, and the KGB are all trying to prove they are the best at catching criminals. The Secretary General of the UN decides to set them a test. He releases a rabbit into a forest, and each of them has to catch it.</p>
<p>The FBI receive 1000 tips about the rabbit&#8217;s location but refuses to investigate.</p>
<p>The CIA burns down the whole forest and said there&#8217;s no rabbit.</p>
<p>The KGB drags a man out of the forest and beats him as he screams &#8220;OK I&#8217;m a rabbit!&#8221;</p>

				<p>@ALL</p>
<p>Some info.</p>
<p>&#8220;Intel from a Ukrainian officer about a meeting in Putin’s lair in Urals. Oligarchs convened there so no one would flee. Putin is furious, he thought that the whole war would be easy and everything would be done in 1-4 days.</p>
<p>Russians didn’t have a tactical plan. The war costs about $20 bln/day. There are rockets for 3-4 days at most, they use them sparingly. They lack weapons, the Tula and 2 Rotenberg plants can’t physically fulfil the orders for weapons. Rifles and ammo are the most they can do.</p>
<p>The next Russian weapons can be produced in 3-4 months – if even that. They have no raw materials. What was previously supplied mainly from Slovenia, Finland and Germany is now cut off.</p>
<p>If Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations. Because they have no money, weapons, or resources. Nevertheless, they are indifferent about the sanctions.</p>
<p>Alpha Spec Ops have been near Kyiv since the 18th February. The goal was to take Kyiv and instal a puppet regime. They are preparing provocations against innocent civilians – women and children – to sow panic. This is their trump card.</p>
<p>Russia’s whole plan relies on panic – that the civilians and armed forces surrender and Zelensky flees. They expect Kharkiv to surrender first so the other cities would follow suit to avoid bloodshed. The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered.</p>
<p>The Ukrainians must avoid panic! The missile strikes are for intimidation, the Russians fire them at random to “accidentally” hit residential buildings to make the attack look larger than it really is. Ukraine must stay strong and we must provide assistance!&#8221;</p>

We are now prohibiting Russian state media from running ads or monetizing on our platform </i></p>
<p>I would not count on that statement. There have been many other attempts to get FB/M to &#8220;do something&#8221; about misuse and FB/M does little or nothing.</p>

<p>Social media giant argued it was protected from liability for scam ads because mining billionaire had signed up to account terms and conditions</b></p>
<p>After years of attacking Facebook’s refusal to remove scam ads featuring his face, Forrest launched civil proceedings against the social media behemoth in California.</p>
<p>He alleges the company’s failure to stop cryptocurrency-related scam ads were “negligent” and a “misappropriation of likeness”. In response, Facebook argued it was protected from liability because Forrest had a Facebook account, and had therefore agreed to the site’s terms and conditions.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; when fake pages claiming to be him started proliferating on the site, his cybersecurity team worked with Facebook to clear them out, and to do that had to create an official Andrew Forrest page. [claiming his persona]</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Social media ads falsely using Forrest’s and other high-profile Australians’ faces [this is international in scope] are being used to sell overpriced goods, or simply to take people’s money without providing anything in return, particularly when selling cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>[Forrest] launched separate criminal proceedings in Western Australia, alleging that Facebook has breached federal money laundering laws by failing to stop the ads.</p>
<p>In the case lodged in the United States, he said Facebook was using its algorithms to allow alleged fraudsters to target vulnerable users&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Andrew Forrest has enough cash-in-the-bank to push against FB/M where the normal person gets stuck quick.  It will be a battle of Legal Team vs Legal Team in 2 countries.</p>

<p>Your post (#400908) brings extraordinary information. If it’s real then Putin is in a very uncomfortable spot. I don’t see it being considered by the traditional media at the moment [the CNNs of the world], which is interesting.</p>
<p>While it may be inspirational, that scenario looks too good to be credible, from my POV. I would like to hear more commentary about it.</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<blockquote><p>Cats prefer higher viewpoints&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, and I&#8217;ve scars on my back to prove it, when a not so large, member of a big cat family jumped up and clawed their way onto my sholders&#8230;</p>
<p>On another occasion, a lady friends &#8220;Persian blue&#8221;, most notable for the contempt it held all but the &#8220;tin opening&#8221; human in it&#8217;s life. Just rocket launched it&#8217;s self up onto my shoulders.</p>
<p>Okay I&#8217;m broad shouldered and a little on the tall side but I&#8217;m not a &#8220;Man Mountain&#8221; although some especially small children seem to think so.</p>
<p>For various reasons at this time of year I find my thoughts turning to a couple of authors I knew. One of whom made an observation about cats I&#8217;ve mentioned before,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Terry Pratchett drew attention to this human failing with cats, he observed that because they look cute and fluffy and playfull, that this prevents many from seeing “what nasty buggers they are underneath”.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Oh the way to get some tiny smidgen of loyalty out of a cat is the advice that used to be given to home owners that move,</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep the cat indoors for atleast three days and rub a little butter into it&#8217;s fur just before you ket it out of the box&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently it forces them to preen which some how makes them accepting of their new environment.</p>
<p>I must admit if somebody smeared butter in my &#8220;fur&#8221; and kept me locked up for three days in their house, loyalty is not the first emotion that would cross my mind&#8230;</p>

				<p>@Anders, Freezing:</p>
<p>Solidarity is the main thing now, and much appreciated.</p>
<p>I guess that my extended family is pretty safe, though there have been explosions in their little town and they have been hunkered down in a designated bomb shelter since the invasion started.</p>
<p>At the moment, I&#8217;m most worried about the people I know in Kyiv, some of whom are very dear to me.  As far as I know, none of them evacuated, and I doubt that they can leave now.</p>
<p>Today I heard a military analyst in a news interview say that the Russian invaders near a few of Ukraine&#8217;s cities are light high-mobility forces.  He forecast (to my horror) that the heavy armor and artillery will likely arrive by Monday.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m very lucky, all whom I know will remain (bodily if not psychologically) in one piece &#8230; but probably all of them will know at least one person who will die in the coming days.</p>

<p>“During that protest, can the Speaker confirm if the AFP positioned one or more long range acoustic devices in the parliamentary precincts with the intention that it be used as a sonic weapon against protesters,” Mr Kelly said, to muffled laughter.</p>
<p>Before the Speaker can answer, an interjector calls out, “It’s 5G!”.<br />

				<p>@Clive</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer. I too believe the rule of law is a feature that distinguishes Western nations from Russia. In Canada we recently had a problem with some unsophisticated but aggressive protesters. Ignorance is folly. There is no freedom of protest.  There is a freedom of peaceful assembly, but it does not exonerate anyone who commits an offence while protesting.  If only more people understood that fact. Our constitution in Canada is an instruction to future parliaments not to infringe certain rights. It is a shield, not a sword. Too many misconstrue it as a sword.</p>
<p>@ All</p>
<p>I am a long time reader of the comments on this website. I appreciate everyone’s contributions and I thank you all for informing me with your perspectives.</p>
<p>I read Anders’ news with despair, especially after the news started reporting Russians in Kharkiv.</p>
<p>I don’t think sanctions will work with Russia.  It is not Ukraine that must be demilitarized. Russia must be demilitarized. The horror of the past few days, and the days to come, demands extraordinary measures and resolve.  But there is no Churchill or Roosevelt.  The Queen still has Covid.  I hope our leaders ride to the occasion.</p>
<p>The fact that the West must cower and boycott because a lunatic threatens to use nuclear weapons shows that we need a new approach to this problem.</p>

				<p>@Clive Robinson on &#8220;standard&#8221; file formats.<br />
RTF isn&#8217;t really a standard format; it&#8217;s a Microsoft format.<br />
The ODF formats (.ods, .odt etc) are more appropriate for document interchange because they have been open standards from the beginning. Even Microsoft Office can read them and generate them, I&#8217;m told.</p>

				<p>@ Nick,</p>
<blockquote><p>RTF isn’t really a standard format; it’s a Microsoft format.</p></blockquote>
<p>True, but at the time I started using it it had the following advantages,</p>
<p>1, Microsoft had &#8220;opened it up&#8221; enough that others could use it.<br />
2, Microsoft put it in their products.<br />
3, The files were &#8220;human readable&#8221;<br />
4, The files were imported by other major software<br />
5, It became an unoficial lingua franca, long before Postscript/PDF<br />
6, Importantly unlike Postscript/PDF it was not Turing Engine compleate source code.</p>
<p>This enabled me and others to write software to &#8220;audit it&#8221; and block any &#8220;funnies&#8221; that might be attempts to exploit vulnarabilities in.</p>
<p>For instance you might have heard of a &#8220;NOP (No-Op) Sledge&#8221; a trick to &#8220;bust the stack for fun and profit&#8221; well it stoped those deader than &#8220;a fish trying to cycle across a desert&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which was a start into semi-automated &#8220;air-gap crossing&#8221;, for data-files that had presentation formatting.</p>
<p>The work flow process back four decades ago was if a document was internally generated, as a draft or original document to print it off. Then along with all the paper documents of relavance coming through the post box, put it in a file hanger in a file cabinet in a central organisational location. Then manually update the &#8220;file record sheet&#8221; with data such as date and who had sent it to atchive. As a &#8220;secure store&#8221; it was fairly good, as a usable resource nagh not so good, it was a dark cave where trees went to a nonexistent future life.</p>
<p>As part of the &#8220;market deregulation&#8221; and &#8220;selloff&#8221; of &#8220;State owned utility assets&#8221; by Mad Maggie Thatcher back in the 1980&#8217;s various concerns about &#8220;Customer Service&#8221; were brought into the light. The result was a kick back to life for &#8220;electronic records handeling&#8221; systems that were at best on life support at the time. Which ment &#8220;cash out time&#8221; for original investors, so the price of such systems shot up to unaffordable unless you had to have them by legislation / regulation.</p>
<p>The reality of such systems were a crude database that held inverted text linkex to an indexed file tree. You could build your own system with an &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; data base from Microsoft or several others and a Source code Control System which was easily available on *nix. The problem, getting the data off of the paper and into plaintext ASCII that would go in the database, and storing the files in a displayable format that would remain supported&#8230;</p>
<p>So even though RTF was not &#8220;An Open Standard&#8221; as we would think of them today&#8230; RTF files from four decades still open up in modern Office apps, even though the other more propriety formats &#8220;Microsoft and Co churned through for upgrade-gelt&#8221; are now in effect &#8220;lost to the wastes of time&#8221; and thus show in very short order the entropy effect of ephemeral existance.</p>
<p>Would I chose RTF these days? Well it would certainly be on the short list where as PDF and many more would not even make it to first round consideration.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m of the opinion that all file formats to be considered should be,</p>
<p>1, Not have in any way Turing Compleat &#8220;source&#8221; in them.<br />
2, Be as simple as possible<br />
3, Preferably be &#8220;human readable&#8221; in the simplest and oldest of &#8220;editors&#8221;.</p>
<p>As such simple text files and/or simple raster dot graphics files that can be if required subjected to OCR.</p>
<p>As you might know &#8220;I&#8217;m a known disliker of &#8220;data file storage&#8221; for good and sensible &#8220;legal reasons&#8221; to do with &#8220;hidden meta-data&#8221; and similar that appear to be becoming iniversal in even &#8220;Open Standard&#8221; file formats. It&#8217;s why I say &#8220;Paper, Paper, Never Data&#8221; when responding to &#8220;discovery&#8221; and with &#8220;electronic discovery&#8221; now becoming common that files be stored as simple image files, so they are like &#8220;photo copies&#8221; of old, where you could see what you were giving to your enemy[1]. Also,</p>
<p>&#8220;You can not give what you have not got&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not illegal to throw out what you consider &#8220;trash&#8221; everyday, week etc. There is no defined legal measure of how long you should keep documents, or in which form.</p>
<p>Thus &#8220;office rules&#8221; about cleanliness apply to data systems as well, especially in these days where &#8220;resourceful attackers&#8221; will get to users systems.</p>
<p>It is not &#8220;Destruction of evidence&#8221; as some would have you think. That at best only becomes applicable once legal notice has been formally given to you.</p>
<p>[1] In the British Army and other military services and I assume most other militaries in the world of,</p>
<p><b>Never leave ammunition for the enemy</b></p>
<p>But it applies to all things, that is &#8220;You do not yield resources to friend or foe&#8221; unless you are darn sure they can not hurt you &#8211;not just now but in the future&#8211; or you are compelled to do so[2].</p>
<p>[2] As what you as the data owner would regard as unauthorized or illicit access to your data is now very likely threats.  Be it by the very real risk of cyber-criminals as seen with recent Ransomware attacks or the currently less likely compulsion by authority, it is your legal duty to reduce the risk, as it effects shareholder value, legal confidentiality, and a whole lot more. You are therefore required by law to think ahead and make life as reasonably difficult as possible for any potential attacker. This includes having work flows with mandated purges and much more besides. As long as the rules and proceadures are properly documented, followed, and enforced, what is gone, is gone, along with the other waste.</p>

				<p>@ Winter 🇺🇦</p>
<p>The specific comments that I saw have rolled off of my radar, and as there is so much going on, I doubt I can re-find them quickly.  I&#8217;m sure they will happen again, and I will include a link the next time I see an occurrence.</p>
<p>Think about right-wing folk involved in a global conspiracy, and misprision of a felony.  They know it is illegal, but as it helps their pocket, they look the other way.  They are stupid, and run their mouth.  At some point, they will probably have to get a lawyer, who will immediately tell them to STFU.  Most of these idiots will not listen.</p>
<p>But, in the meantime, they are providing evidence that may connect dots.</p>
<p>hxtps://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/misprision-felony.htm</p>
<blockquote><p>
Although the crime has a broad definition, misprision prosecutions are uncommon. Prosecutors usually reserve misprision charges for people with special duties to report crimes, such as prison guards and <b>elected officials</b>. That said, nothing in the statute&#8217;s language limits it to such cases. The authorities might invoke it for certain types of crimes where the government wants to encourage reporting, like treason and terrorism.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And Money Laundering.</p>

				<p>@SpaceLifeForm, @All</p>
<p>re: <i> Ukraine has blown up 4 bridges</i></p>
<p>Well it&#8217;s ABOUT TIME DON&#8217;T YOU THINK?!?!?</p>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s got a smidgen of historical knowledge about Europe and battles from the last 1500 years would have known to blow every bridge on day 1.</p>
<p>One of those funky pictures that shows up on my polluted page:</p>
<ul>
<li>about a dozen guys lying prone of the top of a tall bridge.  In the background you can see a nice skyline and at least 4-6 more bridges.  All the bridges are intact.  The 12 guys are pretending they are going to hold off an armoured column with basic rifles.  They should have been down below with a cutting torch making sure that armoured column doesn&#8217;t cross over.</li>
</ul>
<p>C&#8217;est magnifique, mais ce n&#8217;est pas la guerre&#8230;</p>
<p>And now for the next phase setup:  The Loyalty Oath</p>
<p>Traditionally, there&#8217;s a Loyalty Oath that starts making the rounds. It comes in various disguises from &#8220;allegiance&#8221; to &#8220;line of succession&#8221; to &#8220;denouncement&#8221; to &#8220;witch burning&#8221; and so on.</p>
<p>In the USA we had the Joseph McCarthy Hearings.  The chief counsel was Roy Cohn who went on to be mentor for our previous President T, among many notable VIPofVIPS.</p>
<p>&emsp; Senator, may we not drop this? &#8230; Senator; you&#8217;ve done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?</p>
<p>In the UK there was the Oath of Supremacy. 1534-1855.</p>
<p>&emsp; &#8220;I die the King&#8217;s good servant, and God&#8217;s first&#8221;.</p>

				<p>Sunday comments from Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko (Associated Press interview):</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now we are encircled.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>We are at the border of a humanitarian catastrophe.  Right now, we have electricity, right now we have water and heating in our houses.  But the infrastructure is destroyed to deliver the food and medication.</p></blockquote>
<p>Around the time of this interview, I was checking in with the Kyiv friend I&#8217;ve known the longest.  She with her husband and two children are still there, the rest of her immediate family had already gotten out.</p>
<p>15 hours ago, they were still hoping to flee.</p>

<p>Not Day 1.  Not in my book.  It all depends upon where the enemy needs to be trapped.  If is a single route in, yes, then maybe.  But that is not the case in this situation.</p>
<p><b>The best option for the Russian ground troops now, is to just surrender</b>.</p>
<p>Not only are they facing kinetic death, but they are facing death by starvation.</p>
<p>If they surrender, they will be allowed to live.  They will be fed.</p>
<p>Eventually, at some point, they will be freed to go to back to Russia.  I doubt most even would want to do so.</p>

&#8220;Right now we are encircled.&#8221;</p>
<p>They have (long) retracted that statement. It is not clear what the situation is.</p>
<p>What we do see in the news is that reaching the borders is extremely difficult. They show people who abandon their cars and go the remaining 27km by foot. Trains are full and breaking down.</p>
<p>The Poles are doing a really great job, taking up a few hundred thousand refugees in a few days. There was an item in the news about a 6o+yo pensioner lady with a 2 room flat who had taken up 4 Ukrainian refugees.<br />
Note, we have our own foreign reporters who do their own research and (war) reporting, on camera. Nothing better against fake news that a person you know standing in front of the news while it is happening.</p>
<p>Nothing unites more than a common enemy. Also, everyone is aware that you cannot make a deal with Putin. As some American wrote:<br />
<em>We Must Hang Together Or Surely We Shall Hang Separately</em></p>

<p>Another thing to consider, is the level of intel and the comms.</p>
<p>In the olden daze, the enemy could sneak up and secure a bottleneck point, such as a bridge, railway, or mountain pass.</p>
<p>In these times, there is plenty of intel, including satellite, which stops those sneak attacks.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has roiled markets from energy to metals and grains, heaping more inflationary pressure on a global economy already hit with surging costs. <b>At least two of China’s largest state-owned banks are restricting financing for purchases of Russian commodities</b>, underscoring the limits of Beijing’s pledge to maintain economic ties with one of its most important strategic partners in the face of Western sanctions.

<p>The main commodities would be gas and wheat in this case.</p>

<blockquote><p>The 12 guys are pretending they are going to hold off an armoured column with basic rifles.</p></blockquote>
<p>It won&#8217;t be the first or the last time&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh have you ever heard of the &#8220;Boys Rifle?</p>
<p>This a picture of two Swedish soldures during the &#8220;winter war&#8221; and they each have one.</p>
<p>The 19mm bullet traveled at just under 3000ft/Second and would go through an inch of armoured plate at 100yards&#8230;</p>
<p>Sadly nolonger with us, is one of my relatives who told suitable horror stores not just of carrying 35lb of &#8220;elephant gun&#8221; but firing it in training and in actual warfare against what we would now call &#8220;Armourd Personnel Carriers&#8221; that had a small weakness or as Ted put it &#8220;A vulnerabilty spot smaller than a Dragon&#8217;s ring piece&#8221; which if you hit it mashed the engine block.</p>
<p>Ted was an interesting character and  at the time I did not know what a &#8220;ring piece&#8221; was, but a significantly disapproving look from my mother and several grins from those around gave me the clue I should probably not repeat it.</p>
<p>Ted was both a heavy drinker and smoker, and his wife died unexpectedly young, and they had no children. So having had some heart attacks and minor by the standard of the day strokes, he decided as he was not expected to make it to his sixtieth, to trade the house in for a place in an &#8220;old folks hostel/home&#8221; and with his health record got a good deal&#8230; He had always been a long distance runner, and at the &#8220;home&#8221; he struck up a relationship with the &#8220;head nurse&#8221; who was close to half his age, and she ended up in what was once called &#8220;The pudding club&#8221;&#8230; So there he was a short while later with a new young wife with a first child on the way&#8230; To say it caused no end of legal problems is as an understatment.</p>
<p>What I will remember Ted for was the day of my father&#8217;s funeral, as I was the male heir it fell to me to ride at the front of the herse and I was only half way through my teens and now an orphan to &#8220;be adopted&#8221;. I was near to tears and it must have shown. Ted poped into the seat next to me and told me jokes and funny stories about my Dad all the way and made me feel a lot better so I got through not just the service but the wake as people were expecting. Little did I know the hell that was to follow by the adoption, and shortly there after the strugle for emancipation, and what I gave up to get out. So yes that short time in the front of the herse has stuck with me as a last happy memory of childhood.</p>
<p>Ted went on to increase the size of his family and see all his children into adulthood. Even in his eighties he was still fitter than those a lot younger.</p>

<blockquote><p>About an hour later (see pic)</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm let me think, $5000 for proper tactical secure comms, or $20 for wideband VHF&amp;UHF cheap Chinese mass produced FM handset. 1/25th price and almost &#8220;over night&#8221; mass market delivery favours the Chinese.</p>
<p>Either will work if you know what you are doing with &#8220;voice codes&#8221; and the chances are if you use the right &#8220;tape-measure Antenna&#8221; you will get a better range and comms reliability with the cheap Chinese HTs.</p>
<p>For those a little behind the &#8220;modern Comms Curve&#8221; if you need to send text or pictures you use a mobile phone in &#8220;aircraft mode&#8221; with one of many applications that will via a &#8220;headset interface&#8221; do very well encrypted communications. At 9600baud or better (look up APRS apps).</p>
<p>You can even get Digital Mobiles with DMR for $100 that support encryption sufficient for short term tactical, I&#8217;ve got a couple kicking around the place somewhere.</p>
<p>The question of where you put the &#8220;security end point&#8221; and speed/ease of use is realy all that matters on a battlefield, where the enemy know where you are.</p>
<p>Simple memorized words of a small code book, and a plastic 10&#215;10 grid you can write a &#8220;fastkey&#8221; in are all that are realy necessary for upto 24hours at a time at platoon level.</p>
<p>In the case of Russian and other simillar &#8220;conscript&#8221; armies. The real reason for battlefield codes, is not to stop the enemy knowing what is going on. But to stop your own troops finding out what is going on&#8230; thus getting demoralised / deserting.</p>

				<p>Nice MSc thesis that got a price:<br />
<em>Conspiracy Theories: Unwarranted Absurdities, Propaganda, or a Specific Way of Holding a Belief?</em></p>
<p>tl;dr:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Instead of a criterium in the theories or in the believers, the problematic issue lies in the interaction between the two: in the Conspiracy Theorizing, i.e., the integration of <em>all counter evidence as evidence in favor of the Conspiracy Theory</em>. The problem of Conspiracy Theories lies not in the content of the theory (they are not a specific kind of theory), but in what people do with the theory.
</p></blockquote>
<p>(emphasis mine)</p>

ht-tps://theses.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/123456789/11092/Ritterfeld%2C_L._1.pdf</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<blockquote><p>
It is not self-evident what renders conspiracy theories less warranted than justified suspicions of real conspiracies. This thesis is an examination of proposed criteria for distinguishing between the two kinds of conspiratorial allegations. It consists of a critical response to Quassim Cassam’s approach of characterizing conspiracy theories as improbable political propaganda. Issues with his criteria are highlighted and an alternative perspective is introduced. Instead of finding a special feature in the theories, the suggested alternative focuses on epistemological flaws in the theorizing of such theories. Conspiracy theorizing is introduced as a specific way of holding a belief that is self-insulating and thereby immunized to counter evidence. Self-insulating beliefs are compared to Hannah Arendt’s concept of ideology and Karl Popper’s principle of non-falsifiability.

<p>re: <i>When is HiDef LowDef? When you have the wrong cable type </i></p>
<p>MSM report on the &#8220;new cable spec&#8221; for HD monitors. There are several specs and this one supposed to have added a marker to the cable to indicate the &#8220;true&#8221; bandwidth throughput.</p>
<p>Because different cables carry different capacity, and some connectors are interchangeable and previous cables didn&#8217;t come with markers, the vendor is hoping to avoid the problem of</p>
<ul>
<li>User buys a mega high end system</li>
<li>User plugs in all the cables and connectors as detailed</li>
<li>User turns on their mega high end system and gets&#8230; LoRes</li>
</ul>
<p>The other ends of the connector also impacts the problem.</p>
<p>A monitor might have specs indicating X features but cannot deliver those with the odd or wrong cable.  Even with the &#8220;right cable&#8221; some cables are marked with higher capacity than they can deliver because a spec change allowed the tag to indicated that.  eg: a 2.0 spec cable marked as 2.1 spec but can only deliver 2.0 data rates.</p>
<p>iirc(badly) preCOVID wandering through the electronics departments with all the ultra high res screens with fantastic detailed images, often of fish or nature panoramas, promising or hinting, that you would have the same definition at home.</p>
<p>Except you don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The video images in the stores are a special format high res image that is not (or was not) available through any retail, CD or streaming service. The spec for that encoding was not generally implemented.</p>
<p>So the actual visual quality is much lower than the system can produce regardless of the cables because the video itself doesn&#8217;t match the capacity of the screen.</p>

				<p>Will Musk&#8217;s Starlink save Ukraine, SpaceX save the ISS?<br />
<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/will-musks-starlink-save-ukraine-spacex-save-the-iss/a-60948531" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.dw.com/en/will-musks-starlink-save-ukraine-spacex-save-the-iss/a-60948531</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Musk replied: &#8220;Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route.&#8221;<br />
Why do they need Starlink &#8220;terminals&#8221;?<br />
The somewhat obscure reference to terminals is in fact a vital one. Without sufficient terminals — basically, ground-based satellite receivers — Ukraine will be unable to use Starlink&#8217;s space-based internet transmitters.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the same for any satellite service: ==&gt;You need satellite receivers on the ground to pick up and send back signals. Satellite phones, satellite TV, satellite internet — it&#8217;s all the same.</p>
<p>But with Russia reportedly targeting all kinds of ground-based infrastructure, it really does remain to be seen whether, or to what extent, Musk&#8217;s Starlink pledge can help protect Ukraine&#8217;s internet, and its access to information and free communication.&#8221;</p>

				<p>@ JonKnowsNothing, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>There are several specs and this one supposed to have added a marker to the cable to indicate the “true” bandwidth throughput.</p></blockquote>
<p>No such thing as &#8220;true bandwidth&#8221; with cables, as the RF looks like it flies off as you go around corners[1]&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why twisted pair cables used for telecommunications were given &#8220;Catagory&#8221;(CAT) numbers where CAT 1 was just about good enough to be used as &#8220;door bell wire&#8221;&#8230; Where the characteristic impedence of the transmisson line was mostly irrelevant, but the capacitance per unit of length and I^2R &#8220;copper loss&#8221; loses were most certainly not[3].</p>
<p>Some cables are now over very short lengths rated up into the microwave (10GHz / 3cm) regions where untill a few years ago &#8220;waveguide&#8221; was the prefered transmission line.</p>
<p>If you do the basc maths for 32bits for each point on the screen multiplird by two, you end up with some very large numbers. If you treat that as a frequency the cable needs to let the 3rd, 5th and preferably the 7th and 9th harmonics through. So if you assume a 10x frequency response you can calculate the maximum length of any given cable can be due to the alowable &#8220;antenuation margin&#8221; and the cable loss per unit length.</p>
<p>All this is mind numbingly dull to RF engineers, but it does form some of the bread and butter of their work. It&#8217;s less mind numbingly dull for telecommunications engineers, as it is frequently the entirety of their job. As for those doing LAN&#8217;s and &#8220;home entertainment&#8221; systems they rarely if ever get taught it let alone use it. Then there are the &#8220;audiophiles&#8221; who will assure you they can hear how much oxygen is in the copper of their &#8220;digital&#8221; audio cable&#8230;</p>
<p>[1] The real reason is a bit more complicated. But overly simply bending a cable like bending a pipe changes it&#8217;s characteristics to a certain extent. With water you get relected energy as &#8220;turbulance&#8221;, with RF you get a step impedence change, that causes some of the signal to be reflected back towards the source / generator where it again sees the wrong impedence and reflects back again, so you get what is called a &#8220;Voltage Standing Wave Ratio&#8221; or &#8220;VSWR&#8221;. In a perfect transmission line eventually the energy would be absorbed by either the generator / source impedence or the load / sink impedence. The reality is often quite a bit gets disipated as heat in the insulation between the two conductors, unless it &#8220;spills out&#8221; as a &#8220;Common Mode Return Current&#8221; to the &#8220;third conductor&#8221; which is the &#8220;outside of the coax screen&#8221;[2].</p>
<p>[2] Due to &#8220;skin effect&#8221; that very strictly limits how far an &#8220;Alternating Current&#8221;(AC) which RF and most digital signals are can penetrate a conductor, the outer braid or screen of coax has two conducting surfaces that are issolated from each other. One surface on the inside and one on the outside, as skin effect stops conduction between the two, you can have different currents/signals travaling in diferent directions. However when you get to the end of the cable you often get a &#8220;node&#8221; wher Kichoffs law applies (sum of the currents entering a node equall the sum of the curebts leaving a node). Which means that putting a &#8220;choke&#8221; on the outside of a cable, can effect the &#8220;apparent&#8221; signal in the cable. Oh and due to &#8220;dielectric effects&#8221; in insulation like the plastic foam inside and the outer PVC jacket, the velocity factor on the inside surface is different to that on the outside surface by around 25-35% of the speed of light (inside ~0.7C, outside ~0.95C). Which causes different effects due to cable length.</p>
<p>[3] The capacitance of a transmission line between the conductors and the inductance along the length of the wire give you not just the characteristic impedence of the transmission line but it&#8217;s effective low pass filter characteristics, often given in Decibels(db) loss per length at a given frequency. What you rarely get given is the &#8220;ohmic losses&#8221; as these are often swamped by skin effect[2] and dialectric loss values.</p>

				<p>@ vas pup, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>Will Musk’s Starlink save Ukraine, SpaceX save the ISS?</p></blockquote>
<p>Not if &#8220;mad mutt&#8221; Putin goes Nuclear as he is threatening to do (his unimaginable hell threat).</p>
<p>As for,</p>
<blockquote><p>The somewhat obscure reference to terminals is in fact a vital one. Without sufficient terminals — basically, ground-based satellite receivers — Ukraine will be unable to use Starlink’s space-based internet transmitters.</p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;terminals&#8221; are the &#8220;user&#8221; end of the link, not the &#8220;ground station&#8221; where it connects into the &#8220;back haul&#8221;.</p>
<p>Those &#8220;ground stations&#8221; do not need to be in the Ukraine.</p>
<p>Starlink works on a &#8220;string of beads&#8221; principle that is there are about fourty satellites all in the same orbit playing &#8220;follow the leader&#8221;. Whilst details are scant, the satelites are supposed to be able to pass data &#8220;along the string&#8221; from satellite to satellite, as this helps with both reliability and availability amongst other things. Importantly it reducess the number of ground stations required and how close they need to be. The real down side of doing this is it increases latency and can reduce availwble bandwidth of individual satellites.</p>
<p>But Starlink is just one of several satellite systems. For years now there have been US Navy transponders that can be seen from the Ukraine, several commercial &#8220;maritime&#8221; systems that also do &#8220;aircraft&#8221; (Imarsat) and there are several amature radio satalites including Amsat QO-100 Es&#8217;hail geostationary with wideband transponders that do work with &#8220;Spread Spectrum&#8221; and &#8220;burst data&#8221; &#8220;Low Probability of Intercept&#8221;(LPI) signals.</p>
<p><a href="https://amsat-uk.org/satellites/geo/eshail-2/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://amsat-uk.org/satellites/geo/eshail-2/</a></p>
<p>Then there are those &#8220;school project&#8221; cube sats&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://asiatimes.com/2021/07/fear-the-cube-can-nano-sats-stop-missiles/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://asiatimes.com/2021/07/fear-the-cube-can-nano-sats-stop-missiles/</a></p>
<p>One interesting set uses the LoRa AES encrypted radio systems,</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z83ihDBL1M8" rel="nofollow ugc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z83ihDBL1M8</a></p>
<p>As well as a few other tricks. For instance there are also &#8220;weather balloon&#8221; transponders that get blown by the prevailing wind. They can spend weeks aloft wandering around the world. Puting a LoRa digital repeater on one would not be difficult and cost less than $200 to build and launch. I looked into a proposal for these just recently based on the presumption Russia would use anti-sat missiles to cause enough space debris to &#8220;close space&#8221; that could be &#8220;backpack carried&#8221; and deployed by just one individual.</p>
<p>A similar proposal uses electric UAV&#8217;s with solar cells on the wings that can be flown at very high altitude and have a radio range that would alow the Ukraine to be covered by them flying in NATO countries.</p>
<p>Oh and &#8220;Smart Dust&#8221; and slightly larger MESH networking systems have been around for some time now. Imagine if you will Apple AirTags that could form their own secure network and have MEMS sensors for noise, tenprature, air preasure, humidity and even radiation.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartdust" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartdust</a></p>
<p>But imagine if you can satellites little bigger than postage stamps launched by the thousands in very low earth orbit so they burn up within a month or so at the most. Much smaller than the tennis ball sized PicoSats designed to stay up for about a year. Such tiny sats can be launched by quite small rockets from most places on the globe, or fired from aircraft. Like PicoSats they are way to small for current anti-sat missiles to be launched against.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve built a couple of such very small satelites as demonstrators they have some interesting possibilities.</p>

<p>Actually, going nuclear isn&#8217;t the issue here.<br />
Any communication device needs power, electricity.<br />
Without that it&#8217;s just a useless junk.</p>
<p>I already see how huilo (=putin) is targeting<br />
UKR power grid, generator stations, substations.<br />
Even on the peace time you can&#8217;t live long enough<br />
off the grid, during the war you are even more<br />
vulnerable and dependent. Our battery technology<br />
is still in its infancy.</p>

				<p>@ Winter, Anders, JonKnowsNothing, Clive, ALL</p>
<p>Disappearing has to do with content. Not handle. It may appear later. It may have been too &#8216;spot on&#8217;, and it is important to not provide intel to the enemy.  Sometimes, it is better to be cryptic.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t bend your HDMI Cable into a loop or a knot. But, the upsale in HDMI cables is a scam.  The 4K &#8216;smart TVs&#8217; have 4K content preloaded.  That is what you will see in a store.  Setup at home, with cable or satellite, you are only going to get 1080i, which will be upscaled to fill in 4 pixels from 1 pixel.  The only way to get 4K resolution is via a high bandwidth internet pipe.  And that assumes the content provider even produces the content in 4K in the first place.</p>
<p>It is a scam, to get people to sign up for high priced internet.</p>
<p>I would never get a 4K TV over 55 inches, because the upscaling will be more visible, unless you view from a longer distance.</p>
<p>Failure to change default creds is a thing.  Failure to change default creds on SCADA, well, that&#8217;s a thing too.</p>
<p>Ask youself, is a Smart TV that you have given access to internet, the same as inproperly secured SCADA equipment?</p>
<p>It is.  It is even worse.</p>

				<p>@ Anders,</p>
<blockquote><p>Even on the peace time you can’t live long enough off the grid, during the war you are even more vulnerable and dependent. Our battery technology is still in its infancy.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve run a Yaesu FT-817N and a FT-780R off of a home brew &#8220;Solar Generator, that to my surprise keeps LiPo batteries going 24&#215;7 even in a grey over cast UK winter. The 780, draws only 80mA in receive mode the 817 quite a bit more. It&#8217;s all built into a box and uses a couple of fiberglass masts.</p>
<p>The setup is 70cm NBFM to HF LSB SSB NVIS experimental repeater. It worked OK. It also works OK with a Marine band HT to the MF marine band.</p>
<p>The VHF/UHF NBFM depending on where you site it gives you a five mile radius coverage area with as little as 0.1W output. The HF LSB SSB in NVIS gives a two hundred mile radius on only 5W and would on other bands at certain times of the day do 3K mile DX.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been asked to build a prototype  with &#8220;Open Souce&#8221; SDR and other hardware for a potential market for the likes of the Red Cross etc.</p>
<p>The downside of Lithium batteries is that whilst they can all be discharged below freezing, some can not be charged below freezing. This is not a problem if it&#8217;s maned in a &#8220;hot tent&#8221; but a potential disaster for remote operating above 45 degrees lattitude. One solution is like that used by &#8220;wind generators&#8221; they need a load to work into to stop them spining out of control. Thus the charger has a battery port and a &#8220;dump load&#8221; port which is basically just a big resistor. If you build a charger that detects &#8220;low temp&#8221; as many BMSs do, then you could flip a relay so the solar pannel heats the batteries with a dump load. All you need to do is design a suitable insulated container for the batteries and load.</p>
<p>Oh select your &#8220;Battery Managment System&#8221; with care&#8230; Some power themselves off of the battery in a way that when the cells are discharged the BMS gets &#8220;disconnectd&#8221; so it won&#8217;t charge untill you get the cell voltage back up again, a bit of a &#8220;catch 22&#8221; situation&#8230; And not something you want happening on a remote system.</p>

<p>Does not matter, as long as the message gets out and is received.</p>
<p>No power, no radio xmit.</p>

<p>Should not be a problem to use batteries like 12v in series, maybe a resistor or two, and upscale to 56v.</p>
<p>The biggest export Russia has right now is batteries, and scrap metal to be turned into plowshares.</p>

<p>Mind numbingly dull technical details are some of the most interesting details. Certainly more interesting than some of the conversations I&#8217;ve shared with electricians that I&#8217;ve been coerced into working with.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>“Daxin is without doubt the most advanced piece of malware Symantec researchers have seen used by a China-linked actor,”</p>
<p>Daxin appears to be optimized for use against hardened targets, allowing the attackers to burrow deep into an infected network to exfiltrate data without raising suspicions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daxin’s use of hijacked TCP connections affords a high degree of stealth to its communications and helps to establish connectivity on networks with strict firewall rules. It may also lower the risk of discovery by SOC analysts monitoring for network anomalies,&#8221;</p>
<p>Daxin’s built-in functionality can be augmented by deploying additional components on the infected computer. Daxin provides a dedicated communication mechanism for such components by implementing a device named &#092;.\Tcp4</p>
<p>The malicious components can open this device to register themselves for communication. Each of the components can associate a 32-bit service identifier with the opened &#092;.\Tcp4 handle. The remote attacker is then able to communicate with selected components by specifying a matching service identified when sending messages of a certain type.<br />

				<p>Understanding decentralized control will be key to continuing to preserve Internet freedom for years to come.</p>
<p>Decentralized Control: A Case Study of Russia</p>
<p>&#8230;data centers block differently from the residential ISPs both in quantity and in method of blocking, resulting in different experiences of the Internet for residential network perspectives and data center perspectives. As expected, residential vantage points experience high levels of censorship. While we observe a range of blocking techniques, such as TCP/IP blocking, DNS manipulation, or keyword based filtering, we find that residential ISPs are more likely to inject blockpages with explicit notices to users when censorship is enforced. Russia’s censorship architecture is a blueprint, and perhaps a forewarning of what and how national censorship policies could be implemented in many other countries that have similarly diverse ISP ecosystems to Russia’s.<br />

<p>censorship could open room for the emergence of malicious actors who can create fake Tor browsers for hacking and the spread of misinformation<br />

&#8220;I already see how huilo (=putin) is targeting UKR power grid, generator stations, substations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The morning news said work is underway to add Ukraine to the European grid. As there is a single, in phase, grid for continental EU+ there will be enough power. Just the connection seems to be tricky.</p>

				<p>@ The usual sucpects,</p>
<p>You might find this analysis of things of interest,</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rzja-LOqUd8" rel="nofollow ugc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rzja-LOqUd8</a></p>
<p>Much of it you may well have already worked out but it appears &#8220;think of the children&#8221; reasoning is one reason frontline behaviours are not alowed to get home&#8230;</p>
<p>This can be further confirmed by the &#8220;burn in place&#8221; orders for Rus Mil bodies, so &#8220;no repatriation ceremonies&#8221; to create &#8220;Bad news&#8221;[1]</p>
<p>Not only is someone trying to build a false history as to their glorious leadership[2], they are trying to avoid their own Vietnam, but is likely to fail on both counts.</p>
<p>[1] When I first heard this, I thought tight git&#8230; That is rather than pay relatives the penson due, declare the dead not even as &#8220;Missing in Action&#8221; but as &#8220;Deserters&#8221; thus pay no money at all and have the excuse to harass the relatives indefinately. It will be interesting to see if Putin selected troops by marital/parental status, thus no voices[2] to soil his image in future generations.</p>
<p>[2] As most religions know if you tell children things before they are around five, they get built into the childs fundemental belief systems. We saw this in Northan Ireland where grandfathers would tell wee small grandchildren about the glories and atrocities that they believed as though they were first hand living memories. The Grandfathers having had it taught to them on their grandfathers knee, as wee small children. Even though the events were from as much as five hundred years before, and what was being told had little or nothing in common with historic records and archeology.</p>

				<p>@ Anders, ALL,</p>
<p>Re : Starlink</p>
<p>It would appear much to the consternation / upset of people who have been waiting well over a year for their $499 Starlink Terminal that Elon has got a truck load into the Ukraine already,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/that-was-fast-starlink-dishes-start-to-arrive-in-ukraine" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.pcmag.com/news/that-was-fast-starlink-dishes-start-to-arrive-in-ukraine</a></p>
<p>These are likely to pair up with Ground Stations that are already up and running in Poland.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking for further info on the 56Volt PSU issue, it&#8217;s actually not that odd a voltage when you alow for unknown supply cable lengths[1].</p>
<p>The user terminals are known to have both motors and heating elements in them, where there are &#8220;electro-mechanical devices higher voltages are prefered for various reasons.</p>
<p>But what of the &#8220;56volts&#8221; is it nominal, mean, minimum, maximum?</p>
<p>But 12Volt lead acid batteries are not 12V when fully charged but just under 14volt which means with charging head room 15volts. And you should not use them below 11volts is you want a sensible number of recharge cycles. So the range you can expect to see is 11-15volts.</p>
<p>So four batteries in series give a nomnal &#8220;48v&#8221; but in reality would be in the 44 to 56 volts operating range (with a head room alowance upto 60volts for &#8220;no load&#8221; charging).</p>
<p>[1] The heating effect in a cable is based on the current squared going through the resistance of the cable. As the power in the system is based on current and voltage, increasing the voltage reduces the quite drasically. That is if you double the voltage, the cable losses go down to a quater of what they were, as does any heating effect.</p>

				<p>@ Winter,</p>
<p>I read,</p>
<blockquote><p>and the Ruble tanks.</p></blockquote>
<p>And my mind for some reason translated it to &#8220;tanks made of rubles&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>With the following thought,</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the ruble is not worth the paper it&#8217;s printed on, but even Putin would not be desperate enough to make tanks of Papier-mâché from old bank notes&#8221;.</p>
<p>But then again, push a fat old man hard enough and he will flail desperatly to look like he&#8217;s still on his feet&#8230;</p>
<p>There is an apt UK saying for what Putin has been revealed to be,</p>
<p>&#8220;All front, and no trousers&#8221;.</p>

<p>Thanks for the links.</p>
<p>An estimate &#8211; &#8220;in 2015 the hidden foreign wealth of rich Russians amounted to around 85 percent&#8221;<br />

<p>That&#8217;s some crazy stuff&#8230; though I figure that Putin probably doesn&#8217;t have a lot of his loot in rubles, so the British better get cracking.<br />
Probably Australia should get cracking too, as the money laundering and property laws are quite weak compared with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources told The Times that US State Department officials had expressed “dismay and frustration” at the British government’s failure to take tough action against the flow of Russian funds, particularly in “Londongrad”.</p>
<p>a report by the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) in 2020 made damning claims that the capital was being used as a &#8216;laundromat&#8217; for oligarchs&#8217; money which had bought a &#8216;new normal&#8217; of Russian influence in the UK<br />

<p><em>I should see if I can dig up that report, as I have a bunch of them here somewhere.</em></p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Floods on East Coast of Australia have left thousands of homes flooded and people trapped.</p>
<p>The town of Gympie, where two deaths occurred, saw its worst flooding since 1893.</p>
<p>The last time Queensland faced similarly catastrophic flooding was in 2011, when 33 people were killed after torrential rain fell over several weeks. That disaster affected over 200,000 people and caused billions of dollars of damage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We never expected this rain,&#8221; state premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told a briefing. &#8220;This rain bomb is just really, you know, it&#8217;s unrelenting &#8230; It&#8217;s just coming down in buckets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The heaviest rain is moving south to New South Wales, where the town of Lismore is experiencing its worst flooding on record. Torrential rain on Sunday night caught the authorities off guard and left residents little time to evacuate, with many becoming trapped in attics and stranded on roofs as floodwaters quickly rose.</p>
<p>Stranded residents took to social media to beg for assistance. Locals reported hearing people screaming for help from inside homes, and as floodwaters continued to rise, some resorted to cutting themselves out of roofs, residents said on social media.</p>
<p>Australia has been buffeted by particularly extreme weather over the past few years, including catastrophic fires, drought and widespread flooding.</p>
<p>New South Wales’s premier, Dominic Perrottet, on Monday called the flooding “unprecedented” and warned that conditions would worsen throughout the week as the storm system continued to move south.</p>
<p>The risk of riverine and flash flooding was &#8220;very real over coming days,&#8221; said Steph Cooke, the state&#8217;s emergency services minister.</p>
<p>According to experts, the country, a giant landmass as large as the continental United States and surrounded by climate-driving oceans, has suffered weather extremes for millenniums, including harsh droughts ending with major floods. But though some of the factors driving those swings are ageless, climate change is increasing the likelihood of severe downpours.<br />

<p>re: <i> “think of the children” </i></p>
<p>Does that include the reports of 555% increase in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron+Delta in Ukraine?</p>
<p>Other reports are that Ukraine Hospitals will run out of medical grade oxygen tanks in the next day or so.  The EU-NATO folks aren&#8217;t sure how they are going to get the oxygen to the hospitals there. Small supply route access problem.</p>
<p>Maybe the 1700 people in Hospital there with COVID? Presumably they are Ukrainians or EU Tourists and not Russians. I doubt the UKR will bother giving O2 to a Russian atm.</p>
<p>That all sounds plausible &#8217;cause we know it went down that way in India and South American.</p>
<p>Aside note: 2 interesting images</p>
<p>1) The long 40 mile convoy snaking along a roadway. Great aerial shot.  This is supposed to be some sort of Russian convoy heading to UKR.  Not sure why they are bumper to bumper. Looks like a good strafing run practice target.</p>
<p>2) A long convoy of trucks stopped dead in the water &#8211; literally.  Aerial shots good there too. It is of a convoy of food and supply trucks stopped on the highway due to massive catastrophic flooding in AU.</p>
<p>Both cases result in the same outcome: there is no food on the shelves.  Distant stores have no prospect of getting supplies in soon.  There isn&#8217;t anything to eat and there&#8217;s no toilet roll either.</p>
<p>NATO better drop off some food pallets soon. Particularly in the distant villages now cut off from the cities.</p>
<p>If this continues much longer, it&#8217;s going to run into planting time. UKR and RU provide 30%+ of the global wheat supply. RU will get their crop in. UKR needs to get theirs in asap.  Australia is already gobbling up the market share and jumped the price of wheat by ~$1 AUD.</p>
<p>Someone is making a pile of jack and I don&#8217;t think its the family trudging towards Poland carrying a pack of toilet roll with them.</p>
<p>Of curious nature:</p>
<p>When Belarus ahem &#8220;escorted&#8221; a bunch of refugees from wars in warmer climates to the Polish border so they could transit into EU and file for refugee status, the Polish authorities responded with miles of concertina razor wire along the Belarus border.</p>
<p>Hopefully, anyone now attempting to transit the Polish border, regardless of Origin of War, gets a pass and a welcome. A warm blanket or coat would be nice too.</p>

<blockquote><p>Does that include the reports of 555% increase in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron+Delta in Ukraine?</p></blockquote>
<p>I doubt it, at the moment, though later it will be convenient to tuck those killed by his warfare in their number.</p>
<p>Putin needs the Rus, not just the Russians to see what he is doing is &#8220;glorious liberation&#8221; not &#8220;oppression by atrocities&#8221;, other wise he will go down in history as &#8220;The Butcher of Kyiv&#8221; or similar.</p>
<p>His basic narcissism has grown to the point he want&#8217;s grand statutes of himself for a thousand years&#8230;</p>
<p>The problem is these days &#8220;History does not get written by the victors&#8221; as it did just a life time ago at the end of WWII. It gets written by the MSM and people of the world who lived it day by day. I know not how many &#8220;Ann Frank&#8221; there are out there but they are writting their diaries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/diary/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/diary/</a></p>
<p>Even the Hermit Kingdom has found out the little truth, that whilst electronic information may be very ephemeral, it duplicates easily and very much faster, it also spreads more widely, and can not be ignored or shouted down.</p>

				<p>Macquarie Telecom has urged the government not to “water down” critical infrastructure laws so that only business critical public sector data held by service providers is regulated, describing the proposed changes as “dangerous”.</p>
<p>“The proposed amendment in item 32 of the bill will change this so that the Security of Critical Infrastructure (SOCI) Act will no longer apply to such service providers except if the government data they store or process comprises ‘business critical data’.</p>
<p>“This is a significant and dangerous reduction in the scope of the SOCI Act because business critical data does not describe the type of information that is most commonly held by government departments and agencies nor what is crucial to the functioning of government.”</p>
<p>Macquarie Telecom said that if the proposed changes went ahead, data that is not business critical – a definition crafted specifically to “reflect the circumstances of commercially run critical infrastructure operations – would not be regulated.</p>
<p>It would mean that while personal information would be covered, highly classified government data, the “entirety of the National Archives” and company records for the Australian Security and Investments Commission would not.<br />

				<p>Credentials harvesting attack targets media companies</p>
<p>Twitter account of former intelligence specialist, Reality Winner was hacked over the weekend by threat actors looking to target journalists at prominent media organizations.</p>
<p>Hackers took over Winner&#8217;s verified Twitter account and changed the profile name to &#8220;Feedback Team&#8221; to impersonate Twitter staff before sending out suspicious DMs to verified users.</p>
<p>Bogus &#8216;Copyright Infringement&#8217; notices</p>
<p>On Sunday, multiple journalists and verified Twitter users reported receiving suspicious DMs from a &#8220;verified&#8221; Twitter account called &#8220;Feedback Team.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>This appears to be a credentials harvesting attack and this isn&#8217;t the first time such an attack has occurred either.</p>
<p>Mid-February some Indian journalists, including Sreedevi Jayarajan of The News Minute had their verified Twitter account taken over to target other verified profiles in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>The use of the account profile name &#8220;Feedback Team,&#8221; and the identical wording of the DMs sent at the time from Jayarajan&#8217;s hacked account imply the same threat actor(s) may be behind these attacks.</p>
<p>In January, British actor, comedian, and BBC presenter, Adil Ray &#8220;almost fell for this&#8221; phishing scam purportedly sent by another hacked verified account.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer has previously reported threat actors sending fake DMCA and DDoS complaints to prominent Twitter accounts to spread malware. This scam, however, distinctly targets media personalities via phishing, to harvest credentials from journalists, with the possible goal of breaching news outlets.<br />

				<p>Between constantly checking on Ukraine, I have been listening to an audiobook called “Tunnel 29.”</p>
<p>A central focus of the book is the Berlin Wall. This is the wall that was built after WWII, when the Germany capital  was divided into four quadrants, which became East and West Berlin. West Berlin, as you may know, was made of the US, UK, and France sectors. While the Soviets held East Berlin.</p>
<p>The book follows several historical narratives of Berliners from this time. What amazes me most is the lengths that Walter Ulbricht, an East German communist leader, went to to keep masses of people from fleeing to West Berlin. Here we see the construction of the Wall and the rise of the Stasi, East Germany’s extremely repressive secret police.</p>
<p>Though the East Berlin government claimed they were protecting people from the West, their guns pointed at citizens on the east.</p>

				<p>@ MarkH,</p>
<blockquote><p>Never saw triple digits before</p></blockquote>
<p>Not officially&#8230; There was a time after the fall and economic colapse when you could not get an official rate that made any sense.</p>
<p>A friend who went over on business four times a year used to take a stack of very low value USD notes. At one point he got offered a thousand roubles for a five dollar note &#8220;as the first offer&#8221;, he did not accept (he suspected it was a setup). He did pay bills with them and as he said &#8220;Ten bucks for a hotel room and three meals a day for a week, not bad value&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why he also spent &#8220;holiday time&#8221; there and used to joke his holiday all in cost less than his weekly food shop&#8230;</p>
<p>He tried seting up an &#8220;honest business&#8221; but at that time &#8220;honest was not wanted&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here we are oh thirty years later give or take, and it looks like the wheel has turned nearly full circle for the average Russian economically&#8230;</p>
<p>I would not want to be on &#8220;fixed salary&#8221; or pension, starvation is going to put in an appearance any time soon.</p>
<p>If Putin has filched more than 200billion USD which some think is the case[1] then the Russian people would probably like it back.</p>
<p>[1] Apparrntly we can prove Putin has pushed 40billion for the UK. Which probably means two to three times that, and similarly for other countries, so yes 200billion could easilybe on the low side&#8230;</p>

				<p>Amateur radio with suicidal tendencies. If you do this while inside of the Ukraine or Russia, you are risking lethal consequences from the Russian army &amp; authorities:</p>
<p>Radio Related News Occurring in the Russia-Ukraine Conflict<br />
<a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/radio-related-news-occurring-in-the-russia-ukraine-conflict/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.rtl-sdr.com/radio-related-news-occurring-in-the-russia-ukraine-conflict/</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
It has been observed that several Russian military HF stations including the famous UVB-76 Buzzer have been jammed with either the Ukrainian national anthem, or various meme-type songs. It is likely that these stations are being jammed mostly by civilian activists, or members of the activist hacker collective known as Anonymous, rather than any military organization.</p>
<p>The UVB-76 Buzzer is a famous and mysterious numbers station that plays a buzzing sound and sometimes voice. It can be received from all over the world. Via civilian investigations, and through the use of the KiwiSDR TDoA direction finding functionality, it has been found to be transmitted from a location just north of St. Petersburg, and is assumed to be a military signal of some sort.

				<p>@ Ted,</p>
<blockquote><p>Berlin Wall. This is the wall that was built after WWII, when the Germany capital was divided</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only have I been alive longer, I have a chunk of it as a memory from being there when it came down over thirty two years ago (Nov 89). Though the build up had started months earlier, with East Germans being &#8220;allowed out&#8221; via adjoining nations and the Evil that was Honicker and his wife being shown as effectively impotent and importantly without support. Fear of a bloody civil war was spreading through the summer. The world held it&#8217;s breath&#8230;</p>
<p>It was a realy scary time to be a foreigner in West Germany but even worse in Berlin. It was the end of the 1980&#8217;s and the cold war &#8220;certainties&#8221; were evaporating rapidly. It was a chill november and I was on business there, my hosts had made reasuring noises to my then boss, so it was decreed I go. But I felt palpable fear about what was happening, and the UK Government had issued dire warning to travelers, never a good sign.</p>
<p>After I arived, in Germany I chatted to a taxi driver on the long drive. His English was atleast as good as mine, and he correctly predicted that there would be no military action or civil war as &#8220;Germans, do not hurt their brothers&#8221;.</p>
<p>And so it came to pass, appart from the sense of fun and euphoria in the young who treated smashing bits of the wall down almost as a &#8220;party game&#8221; I think most Germans were quietly pleased.</p>
<p>Today in particular I wonder what Mikhail Gorbachev thinks of all this. It&#8217;s his 91st birthday tommorow, a time for reflection. His views were in a way prohetic five years ago,</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vj1IIlqGeu8" rel="nofollow ugc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vj1IIlqGeu8</a></p>
<p>I met him briefly some years ago now, in the early days of him setting up his &#8220;green cross&#8221; he came and did a &#8220;meet and greet&#8221; of what were effectively volunteers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how memories over three decades and a bit ago, are still fresher, more brilliant, vivid and colourfull in my mind than the current events, that appear to lack colour and almost reality. I ask myself is this what would have happened all those years ago if it had been a different man?</p>
<p>Oh and as always, there is that tune&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hPKXKjTBDlU" rel="nofollow ugc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hPKXKjTBDlU</a></p>
<p>So here we are, and perhaps oddly, I find myself involved in these events. Again in the background, just in a different way&#8230;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s actually been going on for a while, and quite a number of the broadcasts are not where the Russians are, and in one or five cases near where NATO are.</p>
<p>Some of the jaming uses a software package developed in Australia, and it makes pictures on waterfall displays.</p>
<p>I provided a link to an Australian Amature Radio news station a couple of weeks back where it was discussed in some depth.</p>
<p>As for where Russia is now, yes they are looking for Licenced Amatures who as far as I can tell are all on one or more of Putin&#8217;s &#8220;round up lists&#8221;.</p>

				<p>@ Clive,  @ Ted</p>
<p>re: <i> Berlin Wall and  Post WW2 Germany </i></p>
<p>Made for great spy novels and movies.  A fair few had RL history included.</p>
<ul>
<li>John le Carré (David John Moore Cornwell)</li>
<li>Leonard Cyril Deighton  (Berlin Game (1983), Mexico Set (1984), and London Match (1985))</li>
<li>Sidney Reilly (d. 5 November 1925) a Ukrainian-born adventurer and secret agent employed by Scotland Yard&#8217;s Special Branch and later by the Foreign Section of the British Secret Service Bureau.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same ol&#8217; mindset hasn&#8217;t changed much, since then. Hasn&#8217;t changed in Europe for 1500+ years.  The USA hasn&#8217;t been around that long, but we got the same ol&#8217; mindset-itis imported from our Lands of Ancestral Origin.</p>
<p>UK is hoping no one notices the Chagossians, &#8217;cause that whole history makes some recent history look even worse. 50 years of UK-USA Ocean Walls&#8230;. coming down.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a &#8220;visible&#8221; reason for the &#8220;lack of interest&#8221;.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Search Terms</p>
<p>Chagossians</p>
<p>Chagos Archipelago</p>
<p>Diego Garcia</p>
<blockquote><p>
In 1965, as part of a deal to grant Mauritian independence, the Chagos Archipelago was split off from the Colony and came to form the British Indian Ocean Territory. (BIOT)</p>
<p>Between 1967 and 1973, the Chagossians, then numbering over 1,000 people, were expelled by the British government.</p>
<p>BIOT commissioner Bruce Greatbatch later ordered all dogs/pets on the island to be destroyed. Meanwhile, food stores on the island were allowed to deplete in order to pressure the remaining inhabitants to leave.</p>
<p>The forced expulsion of the Chagossians after the acquisition of the plantations from their absentee landlords by the British Government was for the purpose of establishing a United States air and naval base on Diego Garcia, with a population of between 3,000 and 5,000 U.S. soldiers and support staff, as well as a few troops from the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In April 2010, the British Government—specifically, the British diplomat Colin Roberts, acting on the instructions of David Miliband — established a marine nature reserve around the Chagos Islands known as the Chagos Marine Protected Area.  Roberts &#8220;asserted that establishing a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago&#8217;s former residents&#8221; (leaked as part of the Cablegate cache).</p>
<p>Armed with the WikiLeaks revelations, the Chagossians launched an appeal, seeking a judgement that the reserve was unlawfully aimed at preventing them from returning home.</p>
<p>In 2019, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion stating that the United Kingdom did not have sovereignty over the Chagos Islands and that the administration of the archipelago should be handed over &#8220;as rapidly as possible&#8221; to Mauritius. The United Nations General Assembly then voted to give Britain a six-month deadline to begin the process of handing-over the islands.

Modern psy-ops involve bringing up a powerful transmitter carrying nationalistic music and propaganda on top of the channel to be jammed. But in the last few days I have noticed an increase on shortwave bands of the old Cold-war style Russian buzz saw jammer.</p>

				<p>Normally for a walk-right-in job he would have forward agents seize the broadcasting facilities so he could reassure the natives of his good intentions. Having failed that, he is now forced to disable it without destroying it, all from some distance.  Confused reports so far about what was targeted and what was hit in the &#8220;Kiev TV bombed&#8221;.</p>

Thank you for Your very good clarification on the subject.</p>
<p>That is something else may catch Your attention:</p>
<p>How a teenager&#8217;s Twitter tracks Russian oligarchs<br />
<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/how-a-teenagers-twitter-tracks-russian-oligarchs/a-60961086" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.dw.com/en/how-a-teenagers-twitter-tracks-russian-oligarchs/a-60961086</a></p>
<p>&#8220;All you need,&#8221; says ADS-B Exchange, is a Raspberry Pi computer, a Software Defined Radio (SDR) scanner, and an antenna &#8220;which can all be had for $100 to $200.&#8221;</p>
<p>The feeders use the set up to receive ADS-B broadcasts from planes.</p>
<p>ADS-B stands for Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast. It is an aircraft surveillance technology that identifies aircraft, their positions and speed, among other things. It&#8217;s like the Automatic Identification System (AIS) used on ocean ships.</p>
<p>Anyone with an antenna can receive these broadcasts. You also need the SDR and computer to process the ADS-B signals, but that&#8217;s basically how the database and Sweeney&#8217;s Twitter bots work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q1: Why those broadcasts are not encrypted, so only authorized people could see the content?<br />
Q2: I guess military planes do not have same vulnerability and can&#8217;t be traced. True?<br />
Q3: If Q2 is true, why same technology could not be used for private jets?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t be unbiased on the subject &#8211; I am not big fan of oligarchs except Musk &#8211; he is my hero.</p>

<p>Air dropped leaflets</p>
<p>Repeating:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>The best option for the Russian ground troops now, is to just surrender</b>.</p>
<p>Not only are they facing kinetic death, but they are facing death by starvation.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember air dropped leaflets?</p>
<p>That 40 mile jam is there because of the 4th bridge that was blown up.</p>
<p>All of those troops are now out of fuel and food.  That would be a good place to drop leaflets.  Add some MREs, and they will be read.</p>

				<p>@SpaceLifeForm, @All</p>
<p>re: <i>Just surrender </i></p>
<p>That may be wishful thinking, but you never know.</p>
<p>There are lots of repercussions for &#8220;surrendering to the enemy&#8221;. Unless the UKR+EU+Nato wish to grant the surrenderees full citizenship and membership and the surrenderees have no wish to return to their Ancestral Lands.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what happened during the &#8220;cold war&#8221;. People that &#8220;got out&#8221; left their families and friends behind to take the blame, shame and fallout from their actions.</p>
<p>iirc(badly)</p>
<blockquote><p>
Recently a stash of old mail was found in a cubby in a Post Office in an old Cold War country. The stash dated from the cold war period and the envelopes had been opened and then hidden.  In those days some &#8220;escapees&#8221; attempted to send &#8220;goods and money(USD)&#8221; to their relatives left behind. The PO Workers all knew that, and packages and mail had their contents regularly pillaged by the PO Workers. </p>
<p>The recovered mail was finally delivered although many of the addressees had died.</p>
<p>People I know who lived through that period, had their left behind relatives request them <i>Please Do Not Send Us Anything</i> because just the post mark USA, was enough to cause them &#8220;serious bother with authorities&#8221;.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Then the part about &#8220;retreat&#8221;. There have been many retreats and advances in wars; &#8220;sure victories&#8221; that turned into &#8220;signed defeats&#8221; with &#8220;Treaty of Versailles&#8221; stipulations and reparations that resulted suffering on an apocalyptic scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Long March/The Long March of the Red Army (China)&#8221; was an amazing retreat and decisive failure, that changed everything when it converted into a decisive and overwhelming victory.</p>
<p>The US Marine Corps was there. Much of the family is Semper Fi.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t nice.  It wasn&#8217;t pretty. It went on a long time.  And it&#8217;s still going on.</p>
<p>That pretty much sums up Europe in toto.</p>

				<p>Re: Surrender</p>
<p>At least two days ago, I read reports from Ukraine officials that Russian soldiers in Ukraine had surrendered in groups.  Today I see that this is confirmed by the US Department of Defense.</p>
<p>Reportedly, some of the surrendering soldiers said that they thought they were merely participating in exercises; only when they personally experienced combat did they have the shocking realization that they were at war.  This is consistent with similar reports from the most intense fighting of 2014, which occurred (as I recall) in August south of Donetsk.</p>
<p>This is typical of the moral depravity of Putin&#8217;s Russia.  It&#8217;s also an unavoidable consequence of incessant lying: when the victims of deceit inevitably encounter reality, this causes a cognitive rupture.</p>
<p>The government of Ukraine is offering cash and amnesty to any Russian soldiers who surrender to the country&#8217;s defenders.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a pity Russia no longer has leaders like Gorbachev with some actual perspective.</p>
<p>I suppose there is a good lesson in what happens when greed and corruption eventually becomes the &#8216;only&#8217; bureaucratic currency, and those that benefit from it don&#8217;t speak out against it until they begin losing vast amounts of personal wealth.</p>
<p>People that think authoritarianism would be great in our own countries, ought to be a little more careful. The GRU is always looking for a mark. Some of the commentators that have spoken, on shows like Fox for example, they&#8217;d be real surprised about who becomes a mark. I never saw anyone who was not immune due to their public exposure.</p>
<p>The records, they go back a very long time, and no one ever came to our attention without reason. From memory there might just have been the odd person that worked for one of those TV networks, but I can&#8217;t remember who it was at this time.</p>
<p>I did notice a couple got themselves into a little legal trouble though.<br />
We had a couple here too, but they are resigning soon, careers over.</p>

<p>Re:<i> Surrender by who and to whom </i></p>
<p>Regardless of MSM reports on the topic, the Code(s) of Military Justice in the various countries will determine what happens to any soldier surrendering, refusing to fight or walking away.</p>
<ul>
<li>Walking away is called desertion and the old penalty was a firing squad.</li>
<li>Refusing to fight is called cowardice (in the face of the enemy) and also used to get a firing squad.</li>
<li>Surrender under orders of a superior officer MIGHT be acceptable provided the military circumstances warranted a surrender.</li>
</ul>
<p>The soldiers face 2 sides of Military Justice: UKR and RU.  They might get a pass from UKR but if they return to RU they might find themselves in the brig PDQ and for a long time.</p>
<p>In historical memory WW2, on the &#8220;Eastern Front&#8221;, Russian combat units failure to advance, defensive positions abandoned and retreat or rout was not uncommon.  They fixed that by setting up &#8220;backing units&#8221; which were not singing lalalalalas.</p>
<p>A good point of reference for Order of Battle remains WW2 Eastern Front.  The battle lines and details aren&#8217;t that much different now than they were 80 years ago.</p>
<p>Wars are never over. The Person of Majestic Proportions never sings the last note.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Search Terms</p>
<p>Battle of Kiev (1941)</p>
<blockquote><p>
The First Battle of Kiev was the German name for the operation that resulted in a huge encirclement of Soviet troops in the vicinity of Kiev (Kyiv) during World War II. This encirclement is considered the largest encirclement in the history of warfare (by number of troops). The operation ran from 7 August to 26 September 1941.<br />
&#8230;<br />
The encirclement trapped 452,700 soldiers, 2,642 guns and mortars, and 64 tanks, of which scarcely 15,000 had escaped from the encirclement by 2 October. The Southwestern Front suffered 700,544 casualties, including 616,304 killed, captured, or missing during the battle. The 5th, 37th, 26th, 21st, and 38th armies, consisting of 43 divisions, were almost annihilated and the 40th Army suffered many losses.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Operation Barbarossa</p>
<blockquote><p>
A Soviet directive was issued on 29 June to combat the mass panic rampant among the civilians and the armed forces personnel. The order stipulated swift, severe measures against anyone inciting panic or displaying cowardice. The NKVD worked with commissars and military commanders to scour possible withdrawal routes of soldiers retreating without military authorization. Field expedient general courts were established to deal with civilians spreading rumors and military deserters. On 30 June, Stalin relieved Pavlov of his command, and on 22 July tried and executed him along with many members of his staff on charges of &#8220;cowardice&#8221; and &#8220;criminal incompetence&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Rout</p>
<blockquote><p>
Off they went, one and all; off down the highway, over across fields towards the woods, anywhere, everywhere, to escape. The further they ran, the more frightened they grew. To enable them better to run, they threw away their blankets, knapsacks, canteens and finally muskets, cartridge-boxes and everything else. [&#8230;] We called to them, tried to tell them there was no danger, called them to stop, implored them to stand. We called them cowards, denounced them in the most offensive terms, put out out our heavy revolvers and threatened to shoot them, but all in vain; a cruel, crazy, mad, hopeless panic possessed them, and communicated to everybody about in the front and rear.</p>
<p>— US Rep. Albert G. Riddle (R-Ohio), observing the rout of the Army of Northeastern Virginia after the First Battle of Bull Run (July 21, 1861)

<p>Some big fat guy and a woman I think. But they should be a little more careful as the GRU act like a bunch of fools, and nutters.</p>
<p>This is just one example, but pretty typical.</p>
<p>It was one of Russia&#8217;s deepest infiltrations of NATO in recent years, and the nickname given to one of the spies was reminiscent of a John Le Carré novel: &#8220;The Resident.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Russian spies posing as diplomats in the Russian embassy in Sofia focused their recruiting efforts on the top echelons of the Bulgarian defense establishment, as the newest member of NATO.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got the wife of a prominent figure in the defense industry — who happens to hold dual Bulgarian-Russian passports — coordinating a bunch of agents herself and she&#8217;s on video taking meetings at the embassy and in public with Russian officials,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who is running this woman — again married to one of the top agents — on the Russian side? The top two Russian diplomats at the embassy in Sofia run her themselves to the point they&#8217;re caught on video with her,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a bunch of dumb thugs from the GRU [Russian military intelligence] either, this is the proper SVD [a premier Russian intelligence service previously known as KGB]  running operations from an embassy in a NATO capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They get caught a lot in Bulgaria but like everywhere else it&#8217;s as if they don&#8217;t really care,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We end up seeing so many Russian operations because they&#8217;re crazy: America isn&#8217;t sending a guy to your house to kill you with a hammer, but the Russians will. And if you send a guy to kill someone with a hammer or nerve agents the message you send is that you don&#8217;t care if you get caught.&#8221;<br />

<p>A Swedish court has sentenced a man and a woman to 10 and eight years in prison respectively for attempted murder and accessory to attempted murder in a hammer attack on a blogger and critic of the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov</p>
<p>The court said the two people convicted must also jointly pay damages to the victim of 140,000 kronor (£16,960) plus interest.<br />

				<p>@ vas pup,</p>
<p>With regards ADS-B I&#8217;m more than aware of it and have mentioned it before on this blog[1]. Because it also tracks the CIA and FBI and their highly &#8220;questionable&#8221; flights tracking people in the US by &#8220;meta-data on &#8220;Find, Fix and Finish&#8221; activities. Importantly it has blown a number of CIA &#8220;Domestic&#8221; activities&#8230; even though the CIA spent millions setting up &#8220;front companies&#8221; and the like. It&#8217;s important because it shows that the CIA are not just over confident, they are dangerously so (hence also the reason behind the Chinese rounding up so many CIA &#8220;sources&#8221; and executing them).</p>
<p>But getting back on track, actually AIS &#8211;for ships&#8211;, ADS-B &#8211;for aircraft&#8211; are a legal requirment just like for &#8220;red tail lights, white side lights, and front headlights&#8221; for driving your car on public roads at night (some countries require them to be on all the time the vehicle is occupied).</p>
<p>ADS-B is primarily a safety system to help avoid not just collisions in the air, but the stagering increase in &#8220;near misses&#8221; as the skies are getting more and more crowded, especially over densely populated areas like large cities every one wants to fly to&#8230;</p>
<p>So onto your questions,</p>
<blockquote><p>Q1: Why those broadcasts are not encrypted, so only authorized people could see the content?</p></blockquote>
<p>Firstly you want a safety system to work, (even military vehicles / ships / aircraft have lights on them etc for good reason). Not only do people in aicraft want to know where other aircraft are, so do people on the ground who would get tonnes of wreckage destroying their homes, families etc if two aircraft collide.</p>
<p>So the system is designed &#8220;to work the best it can in all conditions&#8221;.</p>
<p>As for encryption and authorised persons, as every pilot in the world is authorized and many ground crew etc, also as all aircraft above a certain size are also effectively authorized the secret &#8220;key&#8221; would not be secret very long. In fact it would be out rather quickly, because it would be a massive single point of failure. Which in safety systems with lots of lives very much depend on, it would be cause for major comment.</p>
<p>But also consider, in French they have the word &#8220;sécurité&#8221; meaning both things English has the words &#8220;safety&#8221; and &#8220;security&#8221; for. And even in English &#8220;security&#8221; has several meanings that in ICTsec we use more domain specific words for (one of which is &#8220;authentic&#8221; which has atleast two different meanings in use, and likwise the word &#8220;trust&#8221;).</p>
<p>The dual usage of words is not something you want in either safety systems or security systems. Because it causes confusion and that kills in both domains.</p>
<p>So &#8220;There are good and proper reasons&#8221; for ADS-B to be the way it is and they will always over ride other concerns by a very very large margin.</p>
<blockquote><p>Q2: I guess military planes do not have same vulnerability and can’t be traced. True?</p></blockquote>
<p>Military aircraft are subject to the same rules as civilian aircraft at all times they are not in an active war zone, just the same as military road vehicles and ships.</p>
<p>Air safety trumps most things when it comes to aircraft that kill not just those on the aircraft, but potentially many on the ground when thing go wrong. 9/11 longterm statistics should tell you why that might be.</p>
<p>Actually all pilots can turn ADS-B off, just as ships crew can turn AIS off. Brcause like all electronics in aircraft it comes with a &#8220;real power off switch&#8221; again for safety reasons (fire, jamming of navigation systemes etc). However turning ADS-B off is almost always subject to an enquiry and fines etc. As it&#8217;s considered the equivalent of &#8220;reckless driving&#8221;. It&#8217;s something pilots just do not do unless there is an imminent threat to their aircraft and SOBs.</p>
<p>Even when in combat, military aircraft do have other safety systems still active such as IFF that are technically &#8220;secret&#8221; so their own side do not shoot them down.</p>
<p>Look at it this way, you fly out over enemy territory, off of everyones radar. When you come back you appear on your own sides defence radar. With out an IFF system how do they know to let you pass rather than fly a heat seeking missile up your tail pipe? Contrary to what many claim about &#8220;Stealth Aircraft&#8221; they can all be &#8220;target aquired&#8221; and shot down.</p>
<blockquote><p>Q3: If Q2 is true, why same technology could not be used for private jets?</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if there was such a system as a secure ADS-B it would not be alowed on civilian aircraft for not just safety, but security reasons.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, nobody has to have their own private jet to travel in, even the US President could &#8220;fly coach&#8221;. Thus the potential threat to an oligarch by identifing where their plane is, is not even a very distant corner case for those responsible for the millions of lives involved by air safety requirments.</p>
<p>And that position is justifiable, in that most airports that take jet aircraft have faily significant security precautions. So the oligarchs issues realy only start when they cross over from &#8220;air side&#8221; which as they are not an aircraft at the time makes it a &#8220;non-issue&#8221;.</p>
<p>[1] In the interests of &#8220;disclosure&#8221; I&#8217;ve designed many things in my professional life, many to do with &#8220;communications&#8221; and importantly &#8220;fail safe systems&#8221; that also includes &#8220;Safety Systems&#8221; and &#8220;Secure Systems&#8221;. So I can see not just both sides of the issues, but more importantly why &#8220;confusion&#8221; ends up in system failure and the consequent deaths when things inevitably go wrong.</p>

<p>I lived through a large chunk of the cold war and it&#8217;s fall. The fact it did not result in world wide hostilites, is in many ways down to Gorbachev doing sensible and pragmatic things.</p>
<p>Unfortunately most political systems that promote freedom, have a dark side, in that they also alow for autocrats, authoritarians, tyrants and despots to gain power and hold it[1].</p>
<p>Although there has been flare-ups along the way the last third of a century in Europe has been realatively peacefull and economically prosperous for many, That was due in quite a large part to the actions of Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p>But unfortunately the benifits of stable economies have not become available to all. Thus the corrupt, criminal and despots have been able to get into power.</p>
<p>Hopefully we can get them out again peacfully, as the alternatives will not be good.</p>
<p>Mikhail Gorbachev, showed the world there was a peaceful way, it is upto others including us, to ensure not only that peace is maintained, but the criminals and corrupt can not prosper. As importantly, we must also ensure that people are not &#8220;left behind&#8221; which makes them vulnarable to the words of the criminals and corrupt.</p>
<p>[1] Remember in Germany the people actually voted Hitler in, they also voted for his dismantaling of democracy.</p>

				<p>A question that regularly comes up in news shows and opinion pieces is what Putin wants to do with the Ukraine after a conquest?</p>
<p>I think we can look at how his aly Assad solved his impopulairity: A demographic solution, Assad expelled most of the Suni Syrians and forcedly moved others. This was also the policy preferred by the admired Stalin.</p>
<p>So I would expect Putin&#8217;s solution to involve driving out as many Ukrainians as possible and depart most of the rest until newly imported Russians can take over.</p>

				<p>&#8216;once-in-a-thousand-years&#8217; weather event hits the east of the Australia, resulting in buildings, vehicles and bridges being submerged.</p>
<p>From 9am Thursday to 9am Monday three stations recorded over a meter of rain:</p>
<ul>
<li>1637mm at Mount Glorious, QLD </li>
<li>1180mm at Pomona, QLD</li>
<li>1094mm at Bracken Ridge </li>
</ul>
<p>Brisbane has absolutely smashed its three-day rainfall record with 677mm, by recording over 200mm each day for three days in a row.</p>
<p>Before this week it had never even had two consecutive days over 200mm and had only ever recorded eight in total.</p>
<p>The mean annual rainfall for Brisbane is 1011.5mm and it recorded 741mm in just the four days from 9am Thursday and 9am Monday.<br />
<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-01/weather-explainer/100873014" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-01/weather-explainer/100873014</a></p>
<p>The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said the severe weather was likely to begin this evening, and some areas could record up to 200 millimeters of rain in a six-hour period.<br />
<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-01/bom-warns-sydney-could-be-next-to-flood/100871070" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-01/bom-warns-sydney-could-be-next-to-flood/100871070</a></p>
<p>Supermarkets in northern New South Wales are quickly running out of supplies as residents scramble to stock up.<br />

<p>Flood evacuation orders have been issued for several areas in Western Sydney as heavy rain pelts NSW and authorities warn people it will be a &#8220;tough night&#8221; ahead.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Meteorology&#8217;s Dean Narramore said a &#8220;dangerous situation was evolving&#8221; in the Hawkesbury-Nepean flood plains and water would likely reach similar heights to flooding in March 2021.</p>
<p>Sydney&#8217;s main water source, Warragamba Dam, began spilling at 3am Tuesday, which authorities have warned will have a flow-on effect for communities along the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers, in Sydney&#8217;s west and north-west.</p>
<p>Thousands of residents were evacuated the last time the dam overflowed in March 2021, when more than 250mm of rain was recorded over three days.</p>
<p>BoM forecaster Dean Narramore said about 50mm to 150mm would hit some parts of Sydney, where the ground was &#8220;already saturated&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The water has nowhere to go except for creeks, rivers, streams, eventually dams and major river systems through eastern parts of New South Wales,&#8221;<br />

<p>Decision makers face the challenge of how to adapt when there are ongoing knowledge gaps, and uncertainties about when some climate change impacts will occur and their scale, e.g. coastal flooding or extreme rainfall events and their cascading effects&#8230;</p>
<p>National and sub-national governments may become exposed to unsustainable fiscal risk as insurers of “last resort”, which can lead to inequitable outcomes for vulnerable groups and future generations, path dependencies and negative effects on physical, social, economic and cultural systems.</p>
<p>Cascading, compounding and aggregate impacts on cities, settlements, infrastructure, supply-chains and services due to wildfires, floods, droughts, heatwaves, storms and sea-level rise.<br />

<p>That the scale and scope of what we can expect to see happen may overwhelm our capacity to respond to these impacts – unless we address these risks quickly and strategically.<br />

				<p>@ ResearcherZero,</p>
<blockquote><p>People that think authoritarianism would be great in our own countries, ought to be a little more careful.</p></blockquote>
<p>The real problem as Bob Altimier pointed out is not so much the authoritarian leaders but their followers.</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;m going to upset some but many Police Depts have many such people. Give them a flag to wave, a drum to bash, a bugle to blow or a saber to rattle and they will jump in line.</p>
<p>Their usual argument is &#8220;strong xxx&#8221; be it leader, master, nation or just despot and they are happy.</p>
<p>The thing is they have not a clue what &#8220;strong&#8221; is and not a chance of getting within a country mile of recognizing &#8220;good leadership&#8221;.</p>
<p>But Bob Altimere do not talj about the real evil&#8230; That which lies between the puppet leader and the the followers.</p>
<p>They tend not to be as narcissistic as the puppets basking in what they see as deserved adulation but they are certainly way up on the psycho/sociopath scales, and find as their lieutenants those with strong sadistic traits to organise the followers into &#8220;guard labour&#8221;.</p>
<p>Back in the 1930&#8217;s they were named after the colours of the shirts they wore&#8230; Often a colour that if it did not wash out, blood would not show up as obvious stains.</p>
<p>Such people although they do get toppled, never realy go away. Unfortunately they appear to learn from their mistakes, the so called &#8220;good citizens&#8221; rarely do&#8230; Not because they can not learn, but rather having disposed of one threat, they just want to go back to the way things were, to get on with life.</p>

<p>@Anders, Winter, all:</p>
<p>When I came to bring my Mrs (really, ex) from work I heard a tremble in her voice.</p>
<p>She said she had just learned that a family she knew via a former workplace was killed by a street explosion in Kyiv.  It wasn&#8217;t clear to me whether her colleague was among the dead, and I didn&#8217;t want to ask.</p>

<p>I now think it improbable that there will be no one personally known to me, among the war dead.</p>

				<p>@ MarkH,</p>
<blockquote><p>I now think it improbable that there will be no one personally known to me, among the war dead.</p></blockquote>
<p>In any major loss of life, those that knew them are often spread far and wide.</p>
<p>The older we are the greater the circle of people we have met, some we will remember not just their faces, but names, even the sound of their voices and what we spoke to them about. Others we won&#8217;t remember untill something triggers us to do so. We see a face in the crowd and we get trasported back ten, twenty even fifty years back in time as we think they look like XXX, even though they can not possibly be so.</p>
<p>Often it&#8217;s a smell of fresh blossoms or similar, or a sound or song.</p>
<p>There are native American&#8217;s who have the belief, that as long as someone remembers you, you are still having an effect in the world, thus in someway alive. So they feel it is beholdent on those who can remember you to spread memories of you. Others believe slightly differently that if you think of someone who is alive, and say their name to others you help maintain them. Either way there is a truth in both view points.</p>
<p>I think you probably know my feelings as to what is going on, over in the Ukraine and how we (UK&amp;US) have despite our promises have let them down. At the very least what is happening is a tragedy for all those who are involved, it realy can not end well for millions who are entirely innocent, and the effects will be felt beyond our lifetimes.</p>
<p>As for the criminals behind this tragic event, hopefully they will find what little time they have left very much not to their liking, and their memories villified and held as examples of the worst that mankind throws up.</p>
<p>There are limits on what you, others and myself can do, much as we would like to do otherwise, we need to keep our activities lawful where we live. As doing otherwise just gives those criminals excuses for what they do.</p>
<p>Much as I dislike the idea this situation will only be resolved by politicians, who direct the military to win the war, and diplomats to win the peace, and hold it. The 20th Century taught us many things about how you make and hold peace as well as the causes of war. All parties in this tragedy need to examine their actions and the causes for them, and we need to honestly appraise and them take the required actions.</p>
<p>There are now to many of us to be able to ignore our distent neighbours let alone those much closer to us. We all need to realise that our rights and freedoms can only exist with the consent of others, this means that we all have responsability to others to see their rights and freedoms are also upheld.</p>
<p>There used to be a phrase from sixty one years ago[1] that for many years after was much bandied about,</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.&#8221;</p>
<p>But to few remember the words that followed, that were so much more important,</p>
<p>&#8220;My fellow citizens of the world, ask not what America will do for you, but what, together, we can do for the freedom of man.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is time we moved to those words, a duty that falls not just on Americans but on us all, no matter where, whether rich or poor, we need to move mankind on, not continuously fight to hold it back.</p>
<p>There is an older saying,</p>
<p>&#8220;Those that live by the sword, perish by the sword&#8221;</p>
<p>Few realy understand it&#8217;s true meaning and why all those supposed great works, to make an Empire that will last, all end in failure, and losses far greater than most can imagine.</p>
<p>The only Empires that have ever worked are those based on the notion that together we can achieve more, for all. That is we are all better for community and what we put in we get given back as we all benifit together so we do more that lifts us all.</p>
<p>We are as creatures too weak, feeble, and slow to survive as individuals, however together we have concurred not just the dark that scared us, and the unimaginable space between the planets. We have traveled in our minds to places that we can not go, and made instruments that in our sted have shown the places exist and can be harnessed for improving our lives in the places we can go. Just one such is the movment of the smallest particles of energy and matter, the photons and electrons that in semiconductors give us the electronics on which most of modern life in the West is now critically dependent.</p>
<p>Our future can only be as a community, a society in which we all coexist and we all share in the creation and inovation and thus the rewards. At the simplest, our future is uterly dependent on equitable trade. Functioning trading empires are more correctly known as &#8220;Commonwealths&#8221; and whilst far from perfect, they are generaly peaceful.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve expressed the wish to see mankind leave this planet and this recent pandemic has only made that wish stronger. But what do we want to take with us? Cooperative trading that benifits all in both the short and long term, or uncooperative warfare that benifits few even in the short term but nobody in the longterm&#8230;</p>
<p>[1] These words were spoken to the world from Washington on January 20 1961 by John F Kennedy at his inauguration. Sadly he did not live to see much of what he tried to accomplish. But I think many should read the speech and see that in many ways, we have lost our direction, and where we are heading is not for the better,</p>

<p>&#8220;This authoritarian desire to pledge fealty to institutions and leaders is indeed the dynamic that resides at the core of so many of our political conflicts.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like watching The Milgram experiments, or Pavlov&#8217;s Dogs fighting over a bone with $50 tied to it.</p>

				<p>More severe storms to hit Brisbane</p>
<p>“There’s a potential for severe thunderstorm activity to develop from Wednesday evening. But the worst of the activity is expected to be on Thursday.</p>
<p>“(There could be) severe thunderstorms with large to giant hail, damaging to destructive winds, and locally heavy to intense rainfall rates.</p>
<p>“A flood watch is being issued to cover the risk of potential renewed river rises across the south east.”<br />
<a href="https://7news.com.au/news/qld/flood-ravaged-southeast-queensland-to-be-hit-by-severe-thunderstorms-bom-predicts-c-5901378" rel="nofollow ugc">https://7news.com.au/news/qld/flood-ravaged-southeast-queensland-to-be-hit-by-severe-thunderstorms-bom-predicts-c-5901378</a></p>
<p>The east coast is a common place for heavy rainfall and flooding. The Yugara and Yugarabul people have traditional stories about great floods in the Brisbane river region long before European colonisation, and sediments from floodplains indicate floods as severe as those in 2010–2011 have occurred at least seven times in the past 1,000 years.</p>
<p>The atmosphere can hold approximately 7% more moisture for every degree Celsius of global warming. However, we also need the right weather systems in place to trigger the release of moisture from the air and cause extreme rainfall. The climate change effect on these systems is uncertain.<br />

<p>La Niña can play a big role in flooding, as it exacerbates damage wrought by atmospheric rivers.</p>
<p>A La Niña was declared in spring in 2020 and fizzled out by March in 2021. A second La Niña arrived in the summer of 2021 and 2022.</p>
<p>&#8230;soil moisture in south-east Queensland has been above average since October last year. Last November was Australia’s wettest November on record with south-east Queensland receiving very-much-above average rainfall.</p>
<p>This meant the ground was already sodden. So when the heavy rain fell this week, Queensland flooded.</p>
<p>Earth is currently on track for 2.7℃ warming by the end of the century. Under this scenario, we found the chance of a similar weather event to the March floods will become 80% more likely. This means we are on track for more extreme rainfall and flooding in Sydney.<br />

<p>The government has had the information for increased risk of flooding for many regions for decades, but has not made this information easily available.</p>
<p><em>(it&#8217;s hidden in Freedom of Information offices dotted around regional Australia if anyone is looking for it).</em></p>
<p>Fortunately the insurance industry has been provided with the information, and this is why people in some areas are looking at an insurance cost of AU$100,000/year.</p>

				<p>@ vas pup, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>I love to communicate with people like who respond logically and professionally on technical questions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Call it me making an investment, in others, such they will in turn invest in others so that like sound boats on a rising tide we all benifit.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe in &#8220;trickle down&#8221; or all that &#8220;political guff&#8221; for good reason that I might have hinted at in the past 0:)</p>
<p>I would like to think we could turn all politicians into &#8220;Dinosaurs&#8221; that is make them extinct with very few occasionaly found imaged in stone 😉</p>
<p>But humans being humans&#8230;</p>
<p>I in turn would like to thank not just you but our host @Bruce, the usual suspects, and the many more that contribute here and in other places. It is said that no man is an island, and as a species we actually work best together as a vaguely cooperative bunch of individuals. Each bring their &#8220;dish&#8221; to the table so we all may share in the &#8220;banquet&#8221; that results, that is so much more than the individual parts.</p>
<p>It is at this time of year I remember two authors I knew.</p>
<p>One was Sir Terry Pratchett, a less likely Knight you could not imagine, but he had a rye outlook on life seen through sharp eyes. His chosen method of communication was by both the written and spoken word. About a place that did not exist, but was strangely real as an image of this world. But instead of technology they had magic.</p>
<p>He sagely noted that those who create the magic (by technology) are best not left alone as they tend to cackle and start doing dark things just because they can, and foolishly because it looks simpler to do&#8230; but as with this world there are always consequences.</p>
<p>So all of you in a way are stopping me cackling and turning to dark ways, for which it has been noted very many times in my life I appear to have &#8220;too great an understanding of&#8221;&#8230; The reason as @Bruce calls it &#8220;thinking hinky&#8221;, me I blaim it on curiosity that even has cats scratching their heads over, and a strange wondering how far I could walk in others shoes, especially if it was in a different direction.</p>
<p>Thankfully though I don&#8217;t think gingerbread is a suitable building material even for issolated cottages in the woods, but worryingly I do have a liking for kitchens and large ovens :-S</p>

				<p>@ ResearcherZero, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>More severe storms to hit Brisbane</p></blockquote>
<p>Something people are going to have to get used to.</p>
<p>For all the guff about &#8220;Thousand Year Storms&#8221; the reality is they are nearer to &#8220;Hundred Year Storms&#8221; and if sensible projections hold, will be &#8220;Ten Year Storms&#8221; within thirty years.</p>
<p>Bad as these storms might appear, they are with some adjustments in the way people live, and more importantly build, quite acceptable as places to live, work, and thrive.</p>
<p>In essence they are just,</p>
<p>1, Sociological problems<br />
2, Engineering problems</p>
<p>Which we already know how to solve.</p>
<p>The real question though is,</p>
<p><b>Will the resources to solve these problems be made available?</b></p>
<p>To which the answer is probbaly &#8220;not in this century&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<p>It turns out it&#8217;s about the 8th &#8216;once in a thousand year storm&#8217;, and now it&#8217;s doubling back, with even more rain forecast after that.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Credit Suisse in the poop again.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse wrote a letter to investors this week, asking them to &#8220;destroy and permanently erase&#8221; information linking to a securitisation of loans financed by yachts, private jets, real estate, and financial assets.</p>
<p>The letter was sent during the week when the US, UK, and the EU issued sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which included sanctioning numerous Russian oligarchs and billionaires.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse wrote in the letter that the request was because of a &#8220;recent data leak to the media,&#8221; which was &#8220;verified by our investigators,&#8221;<br />

<p>In addition to serving some of the wealthiest and most powerful figures in the world, data obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and shared with news organizations that include The New York Times, found the bank worked with several controversial figures tied to criminal or problematic activity.</p>
<p>The data, which was shared by an unidentified whistleblower, includes information on more than 18,000 bank accounts opened from the 1940s through the 2010s and containing a combined $100 billion of assets.<br />
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/credit-suisse-leak-shows-bank-managed-millions-with-criminal-clients-2022-2" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.businessinsider.com/credit-suisse-leak-shows-bank-managed-millions-with-criminal-clients-2022-2</a></p>
<p>The findings also included 25 since-closed accounts totalling $270 million belonging to individuals accused of involvement in a Venezuelan oil scandal, including Venezuela&#8217;s former vice minister of energy, Nervis Villalobos, according to The New York Times.</p>
<p>Several former Credit Suisse employees told federal prosecutors late last year that the bank continued to hide hundreds of millions of dollars for clients long after its 2014 guilty plea, according to a whistle-blower lawsuit filed last year by a former bank official and a lawyer for other former employees.<br />

<p>Credit Suisse faces money laundering charges in Bulgarian cocaine traffickers trial</p>
<p>The prosecutors allege the former relationship manager, who left Credit Suisse in 2010 after being detained for two weeks by police in 2009, helped conceal the criminal origins of money for the clients by carrying out more than 146 million Swiss francs in transactions, including 43 million francs in cash.<br />

<p>“a straw in the wind that suggests there is a relaxation of risk management within banks because it is so difficult to make money on interest margins.”</p>
<p>Once again, hidden risks from opaque financial transactions have devastated a blue-chip bank, punished shareholders and ruined careers, raising questions about whether reforms to financial regulation went far enough.<br />

<p>It&#8217;s been a while since Scomo has had empathy training, and it never has been one of his strong suites.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>@ALL</p>
<p>Disinformation studies are starting to roll in&#8230;</p>
<p>As the tensions of Russia’s making have now increased to the boiling point, we have witnessed together with other members of the debunking and fact-checking community that pro-Kremlin disinformation has become ever more detached from reality, and at times cartoonishly unhinged.</p>
<p>Recent, sad examples include the Ukrainian Armed Forces allegedly shelling with surgical precision an insignificant shack nearly 40 kilometers away from the line of contact, allegations that Ukrainian troops infiltrated Russian territory with equipment that they do not possess(opens in a new tab), and claims that the Ukrainian army shelled a kindergarten located in their own territory(opens in a new tab).</p>
<p>One would think that pro-Kremlin media has stopped altogether trying to convince anyone outside Russia of anything. Nevertheless, we must note that even inept fabrications are insidious and harmful, especially given that the Kremlin’s disinformationists have been laying the groundwork for events unfolding now for a while.</p>
<p>A recent example includes the EU-sanctioned propagandist Dmitry Kiselev thanking ‘comrades Stalin and Beria (among others) for creating Russian nuclear weapons.<br />
<a href="https://euvsdisinfo.eu/grotesque-kremlin-farce-turns-into-a-bloody-tragedy/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://euvsdisinfo.eu/grotesque-kremlin-farce-turns-into-a-bloody-tragedy/</a></p>
<p>Over the past two weeks the Stanford Internet Observatory has been monitoring narratives related to the developing situation in Ukraine. Analysts have been observing overt channels, such as Russian state media, as well as grey propaganda outlets and unattributed Telegram channels. We observe that the narratives that state media and grey propaganda outlets push can be found on unattributed Telegram channels, and that in some instances the version of the narrative on the Telegram channels is more extreme.<br />
<a href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/full-spectrum-propaganda-ukraine" rel="nofollow ugc">https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/full-spectrum-propaganda-ukraine</a></p>
<p>“information warfare has been front and center in creating the pretext for this invasion and continues to be a major, major piece of the Kremlin operation,”</p>
<p>Russian-linked disinformation posts on Facebook could become particularly problematic for the company, given documents leaked by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen last year that suggested that misinformation in Ukraine had not been a priority for the company.</p>
<p>An undated, leaked document titled “Country Prioritization for 2021” ranked countries from level Tier 1 to Tier 3 for the type of internal content moderation and monitoring the company offered to protect local users. While Russia was in the highest bracket, Ukraine did not appear in any of the tiers within the document.</p>
<p>A senior EU official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal deliberations, said there was an “astonishing” level of coordination between the Kremlin disinformation networks and Russian state media—including the dissemination of propaganda through social media.<br />

<p>Re: That is not a winning strategy</p>
<p>It really is stupid.  I guess twitter does not realize that most interaction is over 99% Read, and less than 1% Write operations.</p>
<p>I just ran into the login crap you described from a person that I have been reading for years.  Of course, he is #OSINT, and there is something going on with blue birds that are into #OSINT.</p>
<p>If twitter bought a vowel, and made the UX consistent, they may actually get more interaction.  But, the random javascript decisions made by an AI bot, make no sense.  It is not even consistent between desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>With nitter, the UX is consistent.  I do not even have to request desktop mode on mobile.  The layout is really good.  I also like the darkmode which saves battery on mobile.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my dilemma.</p>
<p>Should I start working on my corrupted SIM card problem, and write down my contact info, so I can do a factory reset?</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Should I start fixing my over 100 twitter bookmarks to be nitter.net ?</p>
<p>After further discussion with my executive committee, a decision has been reached.</p>
<p>Open beer, keep reading.</p>

Rumors about Putin wanting to impose martial law tomorrow. If he does so, there will have to be a lot of spinning spin doctors to avoid admitting that Russia is waging a full invasion war in Ukraine with considerable losses and little progress.</p>
<p>Note, these are <em>Rumors</em>.</p>
<p>ht-tps://insiderpaper.com/rumors-say-putin-could-impose-martial-law-in-russia-on-march-4/</p>
<p>An interesting angle:<br />
ht-tps://www.avforums.com/threads/putin-to-put-russia-under-martial-law.2403564/#post-30181533</p>
<blockquote><p>
If, &#8211; a speculative if &#8211; that convoy north of Kyiv contains the occupation force of national guard and reserve troops, Martial law could be interesting. That speculation seems based on what was seen leaving Russia, and whats shown on those satellite pictures of part of the column &#8211; lots of trucks and personnel carriers , not armour. It also fits the recent DoD statement that Kyiv could be overrun by tens of thousands of infantry</p>
<p>The national guard riot police have already had some badly fatal run ins with Ukrainian troops- as they got somehow into the front line. If they lose more men , on an operation they are not trained for, and news gets back to Russia , you wonder if that will make the national guards that would have to enforce martial law so keen on Putin?

<blockquote><p>The BBC Has Revived An Old-School Radio Service</p></blockquote>
<p>Revived is probably not the best word &#8220;reserected&#8221; from the dead, might be better&#8230;</p>
<p>There is a lot of nasty nasty politics behind this in the UK.</p>
<p>The BBC World Service has from the end of WWII, done &#8220;double duty&#8221; with it&#8217;s MF and HF transmitters in that the &#8220;Spooks&#8221; originally from the DWS at Pounden and later Mi6 from Hanslope Park have used them to send out coded messages and the like to &#8220;operatives abroad&#8221;. Look up the likes of the Linconshire Poacher, and &#8220;Cherry Ripe&#8221;,</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincolnshire_Poacher_(numbers_station)" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincolnshire_Poacher_(numbers_station)</a></p>
<p>As the &#8220;Diplomatic Wireless Service&#8221;(DWS) came under the &#8220;Foreign And Commonwealth Office&#8221;(F&amp;CO) it also had military units attached both regular and as called at the time Territorial&#8230; @Bruce has touched on this when posting about &#8220;Aspidistra&#8221; as was, located down towardrs the South East corner of the UK in Crowborough.</p>
<p>Well the &#8220;party&#8221; that is currently in both power&amp;chaos, in a previous existance decided that the Big HF stations around the world that so many relied on were nolonger necessary due to satellite TV, Cable Television and the Internet&#8230;</p>
<p>All of which obviously fail to work quite quickly in a war zone.</p>
<p>So the UK political party concerned axed the BBC World Service even though they were repeatedly warned of the consequences of doing so&#8230;</p>
<p>Well as we now know Russia has missiles that can shoot down satellites in low orbits and bigger toys for geostationary satellites&#8230;</p>
<p>Which means that a defence strategy based on satellites is not exactly a good one&#8230;</p>
<p>So now we are in a crisis that our politicians created, so they are now running around like the proverbial headless chicken&#8230;</p>
<p>It would be funny if it were not so sad&#8230;</p>
<p>As the solar cycle is on the rise as is certain types of political behaviour, I think it&#8217;s likely that a number of people will be advising the politicos &#8220;it&#8217;s time to pull the mothballs out of the tank coils and re-boot &#8216;Radio Enduring Europe'&#8221; or whatever they end up calling it[1] as &#8220;Voice of America&#8221;(VoA) would not exactly be popular.</p>
<p>[1] There is a book known and loved in certain circles as &#8220;WRTH&#8221; for the &#8220;World Radio and Television Handbook&#8221; that lists nearly all the transmitter stations, their schedules and physical location and other info such as power and antenna types. They anounced that the 2022 edition would be the last printed a little while ago&#8230; I wonder if, there is an uptick in HF stations as may well happen if WRTH might decide to keep on printing&#8230;</p>

				<p>Since the ruble crossed 100 per USD, it has stayed most of the time in triple digits.</p>
<p>The range has been from about 94 to over 117.</p>
<p>For comparison, on my first few visits to the Russian Federation (mid noughties) the range was 27 to 28.</p>
<p>Recession and 2014 sanctions boosted the cost of a dollar into the 55 to 60 range.</p>

15735 and 5875 khz are typical BBC tricks of using frequencies just on the edge of the registered broadcasting bands. Their frequencies of 9410 and 11810 have both been jammed in the past week. 5875 is jammed as I write&#8230;</p>

				<p><b>Back to Hybrid Cryptograpic Algorithms but with PQC</b></p>
<p>In the past hybrid-crypto algorithms have been discussed as a way to gain security benifits. That is you move away from the &#8220;all or nothing&#8221; that a hard break on a single crypto algorith gives to using two or more sufficiently unrelated crypto algorithms such is one is broken the others still hold, but at a reduced security margin.</p>
<p>At it&#8217;s simplest you can create a hybrid crypto algorithm by,</p>
<p>1, Chaining two unrelated cipher algorithms in series.<br />
2, You come up with a secure way to produce the combined key.</p>
<p>Whilst this can be thought of as trivial it&#8217;s not. For instance the design of the second step contains hidden dangers such as opening  &#8220;related key attacks&#8221;. Whilst the first can give very real issues when it comes to what you mean by &#8220;unrelated&#8221;[1].</p>
<p>But also, the more complex the way you make a logic circuit the more edge and corner cases are likely to arise within it.</p>
<p>Worse the nature of the universe is such that your knowledge at any given point is generally insuficient. So what appears secure to day may not be secure or as secure as thought, tommorow[2].</p>
<p>Quantum Computing has been flaged as a danger to clasical cryptography. As such it is a reasonable hypothesis based on theory. BUT &#8220;Quantum Computing&#8221;(QC) is still rather more wishfull theory than practical reality. So it actually may never happen in a way that threatens &#8220;Clasical Cryptography&#8221;(CC) in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>However as the hypothesis is reasonable, coming up with a solution to QC attacks whilst they are not an issue would appear prudent (and fun). So we are in the process of finding &#8220;Post Quantum Computing&#8221;(PQC) algorithms.</p>
<p>However the ideas behind most PQC design are effectively &#8220;untested&#8221; and when you add in our knowledge of such is not even remotely close to &#8220;battle hardened&#8221; it is reasonable to assume that there is significant risk of at best &#8220;fragile&#8221; algorithms involved, thus catastrophic failure of a comparatively easy hard break.</p>
<p>So to many it&#8217;s not unreasonable to think in terms of hybrid cryptography using both PQC and CC algorithms. But&#8230; some argue there is little or no benifit in hybrid PQC-CC algorithms&#8230;</p>
<p>Any way this blog post from Soatok, makes interesting reading once you get past the first fluf,</p>
<p><a href="https://soatok.blog/2022/01/27/the-controversy-surrounding-hybrid-cryptography/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://soatok.blog/2022/01/27/the-controversy-surrounding-hybrid-cryptography/</a></p>
<p>[1] On the face of it the two base primatives of XOR and ADD are different so you might think there is no interaction. But when you study the logic circuit of a word wide XOR and word wide ADD the difference is due to the &#8220;carry&#8221; mechanism which does not always make a difference. In fact the &#8220;Least Significant Bit&#8221;(LSB) of an ADD is the same as the LSB of the XOR. Likewise other bits depending on if the previous bit generated a carry or not. Thus the chance of any bit not being XOR is not the same across the word width and dependent on the number of zero&#8217;s in either of the two input values.</p>
<p>[2] A recent example has come up in Post Quantum Cryptography(PQC) and is mentioned in Soatok&#8217;s article.</p>

<blockquote><p>it will ruin conversations in the Friday posts, unless strictly curtailed to “tech” info.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem is that nobody has actually posted any &#8220;tech&#8221; subjects to talk about. So it&#8217;s hardly surprising that people are discussing what has been posted.</p>
<p>As you have likewise been remiss on this (you could have added a &#8220;tech&#8221; subject even as just an example). I&#8217;ve posted above two different &#8220;tech&#8221; posts, so it is now &#8220;Over to you&#8221; to start a new discussion on them or some other &#8220;tech&#8221; subject of your choice.</p>

				<p>@Clive @SpaceLifeForm @ALL</p>
<p>Regarding Starlink PSU:</p>
<p>hxxps://www.tuckstruck.net/truck-and-kit/geekery/modifying-the-starlink-power-supply-to-run-on-ac-and-dc/</p>
<p>Pictures, what&#8217;s inside.</p>
<p>However, Musk recently tweeted that:</p>
<p>hxxps://nitter.net/elonmusk/status/1499442132402130951</p>
<p>&#8220;Updating software to reduce peak power consumption, so Starlink can be powered from car cigarette lighter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strange. Did UKR get some other PSU version?<br />
Car cigarette lighter is 12 volt (more or less).<br />
You still need a separate DV-DC converter to convert<br />
12v to 56. Unless UKR got something else and there&#8217;s<br />
already out 12 volt version?</p>
<p>This is actually an interesting issue.</p>

				<p>@anders<br />
My search engines give the info that the Mk.1 Starlink unit with the round dish antenna had a power consumption ~150 watts. Mk.2 with the flat rectangular antenna had much less power load, down as low as 50 watts.</p>
<p>The 1st model is obviously not a candidate for battery operation. Various RV and campervan blogs welcomed the lower power 2nd version, but regretted the 12 volt version was still &#8220;coming soon&#8221;. It sounds like UKR may have got early release 12 v. versions.</p>
<p>Looking at the truckstruck modifications, what he has done is effectively replaced the mains 110/240v. input section of the psu with his own 12v. DC input section. Not an exercise for the faint-hearted.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Proofpoint has identified a likely nation-state sponsored phishing campaign using a possibly compromised Ukrainian armed service member’s email account to target European government personnel involved in managing the logistics of refugees fleeing Ukraine,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The email included a malicious macro attachment which attempted to download a Lua-based malware dubbed SunSeed,&#8221;</p>
<p>Proofpoint-observed email messages were limited to European governmental entities. The targeted individuals possessed a range of expertise and professional responsibilities. However, there was a clear preference for targeting individuals with responsibilities related to transportation, financial and budget allocation, administration, and population movement within Europe. This campaign may represent an attempt to gain intelligence regarding the logistics surrounding the movement of funds, supplies, and people within NATO member countries.<br />

<p>This part caught my eye more than the 12 Volt angle.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mobile roaming enabled, so phased array antenna can maintain signal while on moving vehicle.</p></blockquote>
<p>If there is fuel, and power to pump fuel, then that is big.</p>
<p>But since the power and comms are being primary targets, that is a big IF.</p>

<p>The cable to Fiji was also recently repaired, so Starlink will provide some backup.  But, also, because the intra-island cables are still broken, it may provide some intra-island comms.</p>

				<p>@ Freezing_in_Brazil, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>Does that mean I can do my own cripto?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes you can, for standard crypto blocks in series, and in practice it&#8217;s not that hard with pre-written software crypto blocks.</p>
<p>If you take two or more of the AES finalists and put them in series the baseline strength of the hybrid will be which ever is the weakest. The reasoning is on the assumption,</p>
<p>1, The break is of the stronger cipher.<br />
2, The break reduces the strength of the stronger cipher to zero.</p>
<p>The second point in practice is actually fairly unlikely, but it gives an easy watermark to work from.</p>
<p>However how strong will the hybrid cipher be?</p>
<p>Well not as strong as you might hope&#8230; To see why you need to understand the theory to get &#8220;the best benifits&#8221;. For instance just increasing the &#8220;key space&#8221; does not make a cipher any stronger than the ciphers data bit width alows. But also just adding the key space sizes in bits does not give that strength, or anywhere close to it. But also the use of cipher modes can cause you unexpected issues.</p>
<p>To see why you need to have a knowledge of why 3DES and not 2DES, and why the Sweet32 attack caused such issues.</p>
<p>But as I said one area you have to watch out for is generating keys&#8230; And that&#8217;s quite a long subject to discuss.</p>

				<p>Location Data Collection</p>
<p>“Network Signal Info” still sent location and other data to Huq after opting-out of the app sharing data with third parties.</p>
<p>From Huq’s marketing materials: “The most accurate grade of mobility data is derived from the mobile OS via (A-)GPS using a first-party specialised SDK such as ours.” We had previously seen Huq’s SDK present in a number of apps, collecting precise GPS location, as well as both connected and nearby router MAC addresses and router SSIDs.</p>
<p>Huq is queuing up these location data reports to send, but not sending them out right away. Looking at the timing of location tracking, it looks like Huq does a batch upload every nine minutes or so while the phone is on—including when the app containing the Huq SDK is not in use.</p>
<p>At each of these times, there were 10 separate reports sent, each with its own date and time. Thus it appears that what is happening is that Huq waits until there are 10 events to report, and then sends that batch.</p>
<p>Many of the apps that we found Huq’s code present in included ultimatum-style demands to accept terms of service before the app could be used. Some sent data even when the user did not accept the terms, but instead quit the app. In two cases, the app had options to opt-out of data collection, yet in our testing Huq continued to collect and transmit location data despite that status.<br />
<a href="https://blog.appcensus.io/2021/10/25/what-the-huq/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://blog.appcensus.io/2021/10/25/what-the-huq/</a></p>

<p>“Multiple homicide investigations, I’ve seen it: ‘How to dispose of a human body,’ ‘best place to dump a body.’ Swear to God, that’s what they search for. It’s in their Google history. They cleared their browser and their cookies and things, they think it’s gone. Google’s the best.”</p>
<p>Tuma described Apple’s iCloud warrants as “phenomenal.” “If you did something bad, I bet you I could find it on that backup,” he said. It was also possible, Tuma said, to look at WhatsApp messages, despite the platform’s assurances of tight security.</p>
<p>Scott Tuma, a 15-year PenLink veteran, told attendees at the conference that the business got off the ground in 1987 when a law enforcement agency had an abundance of call records that it needed help organizing. It was in 1998 that the company deployed its first wiretap system. “We’ve got those, generally, scattered all over the U.S. and all over the world,” Tuma said. Though he didn’t describe that tool in detail, the company calls it Lincoln.</p>
<p>Today, it’s social media rather than phones that’s proving to be fertile ground for PenLink and its law enforcement customers. Tuma described working with one Justice Department gang investigator in California, saying he was running as many as 50 social media “intercepts.” PenLink’s trade is in collecting and organizing that information for police as it streams in from the likes of Facebook and Google.</p>
<p>The PenLink rep said that tech companies can be ordered to provide near-live tracking of suspects free of charge. One downside is that the social-media feeds don’t come in real time, like phone taps. There’s a delay – 15 minutes in the case of Facebook and its offshoot, Instagram. Snapchat, however, won’t give cops data much more than four times a day, he said. In some “exigent circumstances,” however, Tuma said he’d seen companies providing intercepts in near real time.</p>
<p>Making matters trickier for the police, to get the intercept data from Facebook, they have to log in to a portal and download the files. If an investigator doesn’t log in every hour during an intercept, they get locked out. “This is how big of a pain in the ass Facebook is,” Tuma said. PenLink automates the process, however, so if law enforcement officers have to take a break or their working day ends, they’ll still have the intercept response when they return.</p>
<p>The PenLink PLX tool contract:</p>
<p>The contract requires PenLink, at a minimum, to help wiretap a large number of providers, including AT&amp;T, Iridium Satellite, Sprint, Verizon, T-Mobile, Cricket, Cablevision, Comcast, Time Warner, Cox, Skype, Vonage, Virgin Mobile and what the government calls “social media and advertising websites” such as Facebook and WhatsApp.<br />

				<p>@ Clive, ALL</p>
<p>Yep, sed would be too easy.</p>
<p>As FF keeps the bookmarks in a sqlite database, and twitter.com is one more character than nitter.net, I deemed it too risky, so I am fixing them on the fly.</p>
<p>I did not want to spend the effort to learn the schema and tools.</p>
<p>I have been experiencing (years now), what appears to be on the surface, random FF infinite loops, crashes, or even a hang where all tabs are non responsive.  I kill the main process from an xterm and restart.</p>
<p>Rarely, sometimes X11 seems stuck also, which is strange.  So, I have to get to a console to kill FF.</p>
<p>It seems to be less of an issue so far using nitter.  It must be Javascript.</p>

				<p>@Winter</p>
<p>The police have improved a little on some of their investigative abilities, but they are still a very long way from the television shows. Generally in the areas of professionalism, training and community standards, they fall pretty short, apart from a few exceptions here and there. The career pathway isn&#8217;t really designed for those who have acceptable standards, but there have been some recent developments which may see that change. A little transparency helps to encourage better behavior, so perhaps that might be having an effect.</p>

				<p><b>IETF &#8220;Bad PKCs list&#8221;(Draft)</b></p>
<p>It is a problem known by crypto engineers, but not so much by software developers, &#8220;Standard / Test&#8221; keys are NOT secure and should never ever be used outside of testing. But the inverse is true, you should not use your other keys for testing because then they become &#8220;bad&#8221;</p>
<p>But how do you know which are the bad news keys you should only use for test? Well, it turns out you probably don&#8217;t, as nobody puts warnings or poison symbols on them, and there is no real refrence list.</p>
<p>Something Peter Gutmann has decided realy needs addressing,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;The widespread use of PKCs on the Internet has led to a proliferation of publicly-known but not necessarily acknowledged keys used for testing purposes or that ship preconfigured in applications.  These keys provide no security, but since there&#8217;s no record of them it&#8217;s often not known that they provide no security. In order to address this issue, this document provides a set of widely-known test keys that may be used wherever a preconfigured or sample key is required, and by extension in situations where such keys may be used such as when testing digitally signed data.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>

				<p><b></b></p>
<p>I mentioned above that crypto algorithms, especially new ones can be hit by a &#8220;We,did not know, that but now we do!&#8221; issue.</p>
<p>The one that has recently happened is with &#8220;Post Quantum Computing&#8221;(PQC) candidate &#8220;Rainbow&#8221;. Which is one of the three &#8220;finalist&#8221; signature schemes in the current NIST PQC Competition that had not been excluded in earlier rounds.</p>
<p>The problem will raise more than a few eyebrows, in that although Rainbow might be secure to envisaged &#8220;Quantum Computing&#8221;(QC) attacks, it&#8217;s not at all secure to conventional computing on a laptop&#8230; Especially when the attack is as simple as a random guess and test, which reveals structure fairly quickly.</p>
<p>Which makes it one of those &#8220;Ouch Moments&#8221; that come along from time to time.</p>
<p>Title : Breaking Rainbow Takes a Weekend on a Laptop.</p>
<p>Author : Ward Beullens</p>
<p>Abstract: This work introduces new key recovery attacks against the Rainbow signature scheme, which is one of the three finalist signature schemes still in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project. The new attacks outperform previously known attacks for all the parameter sets submitted to NIST and make a key-recovery practical for the SL 1 parameters. Concretely, given a Rainbow public key for the SL 1 parameters of the second-round submission, our attack returns the corresponding secret key after on average 53 hours (one weekend) of computation time on a standard laptop.</p>

<p>Re urandom/TRNG</p>
<p>We discussed this last year [and you all contributed so much]. I`m the crazy guy who wants to put an Americium chip on a motherboard in order to generate entropy. An hypothetical piece like that could at least contribute to the</p>
<p>urandom</p>
<p>pool, enhancing the quality of the RN (?)</p>
<p>Looks like somebody else is trying it too:</p>
<p>htps://hackaday.io/project/4628-nuclear-random-number-generator/</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re at that, why not adding other signals [like the &#8216;earthquake method&#8217;@MarkH discussed then] to the pool?</p>
<p>Now you can destroy my arguments.</p>
<p>(*) Moderator: I received a funny 429 error while trying to post this. Is it me?</p>

<p>re: <i>FF keeps the bookmarks in a sqlite database </i></p>
<p>smallRant: I have also struggled with the structure (ahem) of FF bookmark database.  It&#8217;s a trash heap of heaps.  FF doesn&#8217;t provide any useful tools to deal with it.  You get SaveAll or SaveNone.</p>
<p>There are some add-ons (ahem) that can extract portions as HTML files (useful if that&#8217;s all you can get).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s likely a bookmark-standard somewhere but Im really not interested in re-engineering their trash-dump.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve yet to decide how to manage the information I do want from it and currently use both the &#8220;extract something add-on&#8221; and the &#8220;SaveAll barfage&#8221;.</p>
<p>Beggar&#8217;s cant be Chooser&#8217;s, but I can complain like I&#8217;m one.</p>
<p>===<br />
RL funny:</p>
<p>I tried to do a &#8220;selective procedure&#8221; on the FF Bookmark Database using the built in BIG Hammer Tool to do it. I watched as the process memory increased and increased UNTIL &#8211; it ran out of All Memory and the PC crashed.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember the last time I saw a process suck up every bit of memory&#8230;.</p>
<p>Well there was that time&#8230;  I set up a network task via a Unix GUI, that was a normal sort of thing that W$$ did, but the Unix Gui had a flaw (which I would forget about) and run into an Infinite Loop sucking up all available resources&#8230;.</p>

				<p>As I have been warning, the radicalization of the theocratic institutions as political is revealing itself. A number of religiously based organizations have openly stated an affinity for the Russian state and have yet to ascribe any actions  Valdimir Putin has taken in a context other than favorable. If you haven&#8217;t gotten the clue yet, I will repeat. The largest international security threat is standing in front of you saying they are no threat to you. And don&#8217;t think there isn&#8217;t an alignment with what is happening in Europe and what is going on in the United States. It is directly correlated and shares the same objectives.</p>

				<p>@ResearherZero<br />
The list of vendors is interestingly enough a parallel to organizations that give to the RNCC that for example provide political funds to the infamous Gosar and Greene of DC.</p>
<p>Side note: those interested in supporting a US style kleptocracy should look at what&#8217;s happening with Putin&#8217;s inner circle. Understand that the mind of an autocrat, obsessed with the acquisition and holding of power, any relationship between the autocrat is transactional. As soon as you are of no use, you are worthless and subject to the same treatment as a personal enemy. It is how useful idiots become idiots of the first order.</p>

				<p>@ Freezing_in_Brazil,</p>
<p>First of the 429 error is generated by the site. My best guess from observing the 100 last comments is when two unrelated comments get posted in the same very short time frame&#8230; That is it is in effect some form of &#8220;race condition&#8221; for a resources, and it tells you you are the looser&#8230;</p>
<p>But back onto,</p>
<blockquote><p>I`m the crazy guy who wants to put an Americium chip on a motherboard in order to generate entropy.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is in principle no problem with this, if the chip maker,</p>
<p>1, Does not know you are doing it.<br />
2, Has not been &#8220;owned&#8221; by an entity that wants to control the process.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve indicated when it comes to man made devices that you can not see into there are two types of observer,</p>
<p>1, The observer who knows only the output.<br />
2, The observer who knows the process and can correlate the output to it.</p>
<p>The classic example being a fully determanistic process that gets encrypted.</p>
<p>If you do not know there is an encryption process and you don&#8217;t know the key then you are a Type 1 observer. If you know both the process and the key then you are a Type 2 observer.</p>
<p>Now it takes only a moment to realise that the Type 1 observer is one end of a spectrum and the Type 2 observer the other.</p>
<p>In between there are people who see what the Type 1 observer sees and become suspicious for various quantifiable reasons that there may well be a Type 2 observer who has owned the chip maker.</p>
<p>There are only three solutions to this,</p>
<p>1, Accept the fact of a Type 2 observer (ie do nothing).<br />
2, Take steps to mitigate a Type 2 observer (ie mix it up).<br />
3, Remove the Type 2 observer from the equation (don&#8217;t use the chip).</p>
<p>Obviously we would from a security perspective like to go with Solution 3. But for various reasons can not.</p>
<p>Therefore Solution 2, would appear like a good idea, BUT it only is if both parties in a communication don&#8217;t use Solution 1.</p>
<p>The problem is Solution 1 is the mass market option and usually there is no way to avoid the second party using it. Worse they use it within protocols that an attacker only need know one of the random numbers to break the system&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just one of the reasons why I argue that people need to &#8220;move the security end point&#8221; off the &#8211;mass market therefor &#8220;owned&#8221;&#8211; device into a system that you know is not owned, that is a Solution 3 option.</p>
<p>Simple to explain&#8230; But not so easy to do, unless&#8230; back last century I and I assume others realised that &#8220;if they do unto you&#8221; you can be &#8220;biblical&#8221; and &#8220;do unto them&#8221; in return. That is the old &#8220;Eye for an eye&#8221; option or in this case &#8220;crypto to the rescue&#8221;&#8230; if they use encryption then you use encryption.</p>
<p>So take the output of the chip suspect or not and put it through an encryption process.</p>
<p>Back in the mid 1990&#8217;s I was doing this for an entirely different reason. I did it by using a high speed stream generator that drove the plain text input to a crypto function, and the output was the ciphertext. The key for the crypto function was derived from the equivalent of an &#8220;entropy pool&#8221; system fed by a slow TRNG.</p>
<p>Obviously to do this you need to take care which basic crypto functions you use. Some use Key Derivation Functions that are so slow, they in effect act as timing side channels in their own right&#8230;</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<p>With regards BGP route change you should have included,</p>
<p>Expected ASN: 212463 (NGROUP, <b>UA</b>)</p>
<p>And the unexpectd &#8220;event&#8221;,</p>
<p>Detected Origin ASN 35004 (NETGRUP, <b>RU</b>)</p>
<p>So someone has been redirecting network traffic from UA Ukraine to RU Russia.</p>
<p>Now why would anyone want to do that, I wonder&#8230;</p>
<p>How many decades is it now, people have been calling for BGP to be made &#8220;more secure&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Maybe it is time people started taking note, as &#8220;Death Lists&#8221; can be made on knowledge of such rerouted traffic.</p>

				<p>@ Clive, Freezing_in_Brazil</p>
<blockquote><p>
First of the 429 error is generated by the site.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Objection!  Assumes facts not in evidence.</p>
<p>Here is why.  First, your browser has ESTABLISHED a TCP connection to the server. Your browser and the server have completed the TCP handshake.  Either 3-way or 4-way. (prefer 4-way).</p>
<p>Next, your browser will start HTTPS protocol.  Note that you are not in SSL/TLS mode yet, even if using TCP port 443.</p>
<p>The browser next requests to start a TLS handshake, and determine which ciphers they will agree upon.</p>
<p>It is at that point, that the server can return a 429.  Or something or someone.  It is still all cleartext at that point.</p>
<p>Browser gets error, and closes the TCP connection.  Which frees up memory resources on the server (and the client).</p>
<p>The 429 error is an HTTP error, not a TCP error. (TCP errors are ICMP).  But, since it is cleartext up to a point, it is possible there could be a MITM.  Not likely, but possible.</p>
<p>As Clive said, it is coming from the server.  Which is likely the case. But there is no guarantee that is fact.  The server is not really rate limiting anyone specifically, it is just throwing that out indiscriminatedly when overloaded.</p>
<p>It should not be overloaded for this particular site.  But maybe the server thinks it is sometimes.  Maybe there is a bunch of webcrawlers hitting the site at the same time.  Maybe a DDoS.</p>
<p>Maybe there are millions of readers that we do not know about.</p>
<p>When you encounter a 429, it was probably just random bad luck.</p>
<p>It is probably nginx returning the 429.</p>
