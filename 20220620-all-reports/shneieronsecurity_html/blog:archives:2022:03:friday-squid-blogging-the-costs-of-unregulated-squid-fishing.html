				<p>@ Leon Theremin, ALL,</p>
<p>With regards,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Protesters turn to tinfoil hats as increasing sickness blamed on Government beaming radiation rays&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I thought Wellington NZ had giant parrots not flightless cuckoos as an endangered species&#8230;</p>
<p>I guess the next thing no doubt reported will be stories of the &#8220;Boris and Natasha 30th Anniversary Tour&#8221;[1]&#8230;</p>
<p>[1] For those of more tender years, in 1992 the cartoon sprung forth a TV Movie&#8230; Importantly though,</p>
<p>Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale are still the spies of old for the picayunish nation of Pottsylvania, corseted between the more powerful states of Wrestlemania and Yoursovania. Where the Cold War of old is still as frigid as glacial ice, as is their respect towards their Fearless Leader skulking in  &#8220;Central Control&#8221; nashing his vulpine teeth, beneath the glassy dead cod-eye monocular stare as he carries out the unseen Mr Big&#8217;s orders.</p>

				<p>@Leon Theremin</p>
<p>An Australian MP, Craig Kelly has already been pushing a sonic conspiracy, suggesting perhaps audio speakers might be the source, and some kind of weapon to quell protests wielded by Australian Federal Police.</p>
<p>Mr Kelly has already been pulled up in the past about visits to certain places (known for &#8220;honey traps&#8221;) and frequented by Russian intelligence officers.</p>
<p>A lack of information, and disinformation pushed by the likes of Craig Kelly leads to hysteria. If people are worried about &#8220;microwaves&#8221; they should ask their governments about Russian intelligence operations in their country.</p>
<p>The information to avoid a direct energy weapon is very simple, &#8220;retreat to a room where the effects are no longer noticeable&#8221;.</p>
<p>Although there is a U.S. bill signed into law to assist victims, there is no such action from allied nations who continue to be completely mute on the subject. One such country is Australia which has disclosed nothing, though possesses a wealth of information about directed energy attacks by the GRU, and identities of the victims (who often remained uniformed).</p>
<p>&#8220;a new ambassador, Walter Stoessel, arrived in 1974 and threatened to resign unless everyone was told. &#8220;That caused something like panic,&#8221; recalls Mr Matlock. Embassy staff whose children were in a basement nursery were especially worried. But the State Department played down any risk.&#8221;  </p>
<p><em>the State Department played down any risk.</em> This is incorrect, it&#8217;s not just the State Department that played down the risk, it is also several allied nations and their governments and agencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Ambassador  Stoessel, himself, fell ill &#8211; with bleeding of the  eyes as one of his symptoms. In a now declassified 1975 phone call to the Soviet ambassador to Washington, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger linked Stoessel&#8217;s illness to microwaves, admitting &#8220;we are trying to keep the thing quiet&#8221;. Stoessel died of leukaemia at the age of 66. &#8220;He decided to play the good soldier&#8221;, and not make a fuss, his daughter told the BBC.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The beam came from an antenna on the balcony of a nearby Soviet apartment and hit the upper floors of the embassy where the ambassador&#8217;s office and more sensitive work was carried out. It had been first spotted in the 1950s and was later monitored from a room on the 10th floor. But its existence was a secret tightly held from all but a few working inside. &#8220;We were trying to figure out just what might be its purpose,&#8221; explains Jack Matlock, number two at the embassy in the mid-70s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From 1976 screens were installed to protect people. But many diplomats were angry, believing the State Department had first kept quiet, and then resisted acknowledging any possible health impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>These kinds of incidents continued through the 1980&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s. Known victims, were not only military and intelligence, but also family members, neighbors, and a few people who got themselves a little too involved doing dirty work for officers from the GRU.</p>
<p>Disinformation is easy with all the 5G Nanobot/Cell Tower conspiracies, and Western Governments remaining very tight lipped about Russian operations over the years.</p>
<p>Government could release more information, what the mobile systems look like, the antenna, which unit of Russian Military Intelligence is behind the attacks for example, the identities of these individuals. These systems are not easy to build and require a considerable budget.</p>
<p>Considering these kind of activities, and others, continued unchallenged, it&#8217;s no wonder Putin has the idea there are no consequences for his actions.<br />
Early in his career, before he became president, he employed &#8220;hybrid methods&#8221; (kidnappings, assassinations, poisoning and other covert methods) to gain power, and also directed attacks against innocent victims, including operations on foreign soil.</p>

				<p>On to something a with a little less tin foil&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;The researchers said they named the 19 vulnerabilities as Ripple20 not because they were 20 vulnerabilities in the beginning, but because of the ripple effect they&#8217;ll cause in the IoT landscape in 2020, and the years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Researchers say they only scratched the surface when it comes to discovering all the devices that have implemented Treck&#8217;s TCP/IP library, and that many equipment vendors will need to verify their own code going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vulnerabilies in Treck TCP/IP stack affect IPv4, IPv6, UDP, DNS, DHCP, TCP, ICMPv4 and ARP</p>
<p>Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow remote code execution or exposure of sensitive information.<br />

<p>This updated advisory is a follow-up to the advisory update titled ICSA-20-168-01 Treck TCP/IP Stack (Update G) that was published Aug 20, 2020, to the ICS webpage on <a href="http://www.cisa.gov/uscert" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.cisa.gov/uscert</a>.</p>
<p>CISA is issuing this advisory to provide early notice of the reported vulnerabilities and identify baseline mitigations for reducing risks to these and other cybersecurity attacks.</p>

				<p>Antennas pointing up into the sky are not attacking you with radiation. By all means, if you see a couple of Russians pointing an antenna at you, record them on video, or at least some description, their license plate number. If you were attacked you would no be complaining, &#8220;errrr, I&#8217;m feeling a little sick&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s highly doubtful you are going to be attacked, with all the news coverage, unless you work/worked for the CIA or another service, and the GRU has a very specific reason. If you want to campaign for something, campaign for the real actual victims.</p>
<p>Go for a jog, get out of the house, get a RAT test, check for Covid, and if you still are not feeling better, maybe see a doctor.</p>

				<p>Leon, that video from Tech Ingredients is sort of ok &#8211; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just conspiracy theories. (Although many will assume it is)</p>
<p>He does a lot of interesting tech stuff on his channel. Sometimes controversial but always educational. It will appeal to many of the geeks on here.</p>
<p>His solid-fuel rocket series is a lot of fun.</p>

				<p>@Leon, All</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a sad reflection on the supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic that it has taken so long for such behaviour to get across the Pacific, along with the links between vax and 5G, and the microchip trackers.</p>
<p>Since abandoning most controls the NZ death rate is currently about 1 per million per day, which has caused some to ask if the pandemic is real, or is it just because we are being told about it?</p>

				<p>@ ALL,</p>
<p><b>Hobbies and security in a changing world</b></p>
<p>As some of you know I work with RF Comms very widely both as a hobby, in other hobbies, and professionaly in quite a few areas.</p>
<p>So not just the broadcast industry and commercial long haul comms but also for charities and the like who work in very remote areas where there is no &#8220;landline or Mobile Phone&#8221; and where &#8220;War-Lords&#8221; and similar represent a threat.</p>
<p>Then quite importantly  there is &#8220;Emergancy Services Comms&#8221;(EmCom) as well. Because what many do not realise is even in some parts of the first world you do not have &#8220;phone coverage&#8221; or mobile[1] coverage at all. Or worse it is lost easily or fairly quickly due to even a little bad weather or human activity (even rodents can take down mobile service just by gnawing a cable or two).</p>
<p>Because VHF/UHF hand held two-way / walkie-talkie / handie-talkie equipment is of very limited range, sometimes less than a couple of miles, other solutions are required for longer ranges such as things like MF NVIS and HF comms and similar are still very much required even from cars and small teams of S&amp;R and FR going more than a couple of miles.</p>
<p>In fact in this rapidly changing world there is something we should all &#8220;on-board&#8221;,</p>
<p>That is REMEMBER apart from the aim of their base activities there is very very little difference between Emergancy Services such as &#8220;Search and Rescue&#8221;(S&amp;R), &#8220;First Responders&#8221;(FR) and the Military when it comes to Communications. Likewise any group of people including social groups, like family and friends etc.</p>
<p>In what were once &#8220;normal times&#8221; most communications used for hobbies do not need to be secure, and in the case of Amateur/Ham Radio, CB etc legaly you have to send things unencrypted and in an inteligable form sometimes called &#8220;In the clear&#8221;.</p>
<p>Less clear is if you use RF comms for a non communications related hobby or professional like maritime activities such as sailing, motor cruising, and other similar activities like flying gliders, hot air ballons etc.</p>
<p>Usually close to shore or inland these days you can often use mobile phone service[1], similarly from boats and ships if you can use Email or messaging or other data transmission for weather chart updates etc via mobile service provision.</p>
<p>But what of activities where you go over a horizon where &#8220;Line of Sight&#8221; comms does not work such as &#8220;offshore&#8221; activities, or wilder terrain or even forrests and woods. That is where mobile service is out of range and you do not for various reasons have satellite comms service through Imarsat or similar.</p>
<p>Well for maritime activities since shortly after the Titanic sank, the use of &#8220;Radio Telephony&#8221;(RT) has been required by law for all maratime vessels of a certain class or size and above (be it morse code or voice).</p>
<p>Obviously if you place a RT call on the MF/HF or even ship-ship VHF frequences it radiates out and can be picked up by anyone in range. So the system lacks &#8220;Privacy&#8221; hence the use of &#8220;commercial codes&#8221; has been allowed and still is.</p>
<p>But less talked about as quite a few do not want to go there, is there are times you either want to or are legaly required to use &#8220;privacy&#8221; measures.</p>
<p>Some are not immediatly obvious such as if a crew member becomes ill and you need to communicate with a Dr. There is all sorts of legislation you are probably unaware of comes into play, and you have a legal duty of care towards confidence (ie privacy). Likewise with semi-commercial or commercial activities.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve indicated the times have chwnged in many places in the world, and much more frequently there are times when &#8220;Privacy&#8221; is not sufficient. That is things need to be rather more &#8220;secure&#8221; as peoples lives are very much at risk. People like &#8220;Charity Workers&#8221; in hostile areas where there are War Lords, dictators and similar looking to kill those helping others for political or other gain.</p>
<p>This increase in &#8220;security&#8221; for communications is sometimes given names like &#8220;Operational Security&#8221;(OpSec), &#8220;Communications Security&#8221;(CommSec) and &#8220;Low Probability of Intercept&#8221;(LPI), etc.</p>
<p>One such way is to make your &#8220;Over The Air&#8221;(OTA) comms hard to be picked up via LPI techniques.</p>
<p>As it turns out many of the LPI techniques used by the Military etc, are also used by &#8220;Radio Enthusiasts&#8221; like Ham Radio operators in a desire not just to be more efficient and of higher reliability but to have fun. That includes the likes of Nobel Prize winning physicists who like the idea of &#8220;bouncing signals off of the moon&#8221; by the use of &#8220;Earth Moon Earth&#8221;(EME) techniques. EME used to be used by the NSA and Five-Eyes to get communications around the horizon, and they may well be doing so still today as &#8220;The moon is a satellite you can not shoot down&#8221;.</p>
<p>EME has given rise to some very interesting new &#8220;Data Modes&#8221; that use so little radiated power they are effectively &#8220;below the noise floor&#8221; if you do not know the precise time, frequency, and modulation mode in use. Also they can be fully automatic and of very short time duration and employ both time and frequency agile techniques. Whilst not impossible to find, these charecteristics wete the Military&#8217;s hotest dream for &#8220;behind enemy lines&#8221; LPI OpSec from WWII through the &#8220;Cold War&#8221; and certainly upto the second Gulf War if not still considered today.</p>
<p>You too can play these days as well&#8230; All you need is a laptop and &#8220;Low Power&#8221;(QRP) HF rig that can be easily &#8220;broadbanded&#8221; (MARS Mod etc). Which you can put together for considerably less than $1000. You can even find YouTube channels (look for OH8STN and KM4ACK) that tell you most of what you want to know.</p>
<p>But whilst the LPI techniques are fine legally, you still bump into the &#8220;in the clear&#8221; on the OTA interface issue and you will not find many people who will tell you directly how to do this.</p>
<p>Well when it comes to &#8220;voice comms&#8221; privacy is difficult, as any discussion about VoIP &#8220;voice security&#8221; will show.</p>
<p>But &#8220;Digital Modes&#8221; are just a &#8220;communications channel&#8221; into which you supply &#8220;data&#8221; any data, and as with all &#8220;information chanbels&#8221; you can &#8220;open a secure covert channel&#8221; within it. This has been &#8220;known&#8221; for longer than several millennium but it was only with the work of Claude Shannon and others that it got a mathmatical analysis methord and joined the ranks of other sciences with &#8220;Information Theory&#8221;.</p>
<p>As was widely known from the Boar War onwards if you &#8220;encrypt your message&#8221; you can still send it like any other message. In modern terms think about totally insecure text messaging, if you type in &#8220;Hi, how yer doing&#8230;&#8221; then your message content is known to anyone who knows how to intercept the message (which is probably in the millions of people). However if instead you sent &#8220;JDGHE QZPRS BKEGR DGNDI VEJFY BDJTV SJFHT&#8230;&#8221; although they could get at the message it has no know meaning to them without other information including the &#8220;encryption key&#8221;.</p>
<p>There is in most places know law against sending encrypted traffic, if there was then internet commerce would not be possible.</p>
<p>Interestingly though many Ham Radio software applications such as WinLnk are split into the &#8220;user interface&#8221; and &#8220;communications interface&#8221;. For historical / test reasons the user interface normally can use the Internet via the Telnet or similar protocol, as well as a myriad of radio interfaces,</p>
<p>As such you can set these Ham Applications up to use various communications interfaces. So if it communicates across the Internet, encryption is legal, but if you use a radio interface under normal usage then you are supposed to send &#8220;in the clear&#8221; on the OTA.</p>
<p>KM4ACK has just posted a YouTube video about using WinLink on a Raspberry Pi to use the Internet to send encrypted messages &#8220;Point to Point&#8221; with the encryption done outside of that (so &#8220;End to End Encryption),</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYCP4Xrn8UY" rel="nofollow ugc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYCP4Xrn8UY</a></p>
<p>He speeds over the encryption but has a more indepth video on it, showing it for encrypting data files and the like.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2OAbU3WSPV4" rel="nofollow ugc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2OAbU3WSPV4</a></p>
<p>But if you are a Ham Operator he also has videos of how to set up WinLink to work over radio links. Switching between Internet and Radio as the communications channel is not difficult so Ham Operators should take care&#8230;</p>
<p>But WinLiink is also used by dayboat and offshore sailors through a paid subscription service, where &#8220;privacy&#8221; is often a requirment so they to can use such a setup and be able to use &#8220;privacy&#8221; techniques such as codes and ciphers.</p>
<p>KM4ACK also talks about LPI and other &#8220;obscurity&#8221; techniqies,</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oIyckKhZrpA" rel="nofollow ugc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oIyckKhZrpA</a></p>
<p>But also look into,</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/c/RadioPrepper" rel="nofollow ugc">https://m.youtube.com/c/RadioPrepper</a></p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/SurvivalTechEU" rel="nofollow ugc">https://m.youtube.com/user/SurvivalTechEU</a></p>
<p>Put it together and if you find yourself living in a cave or similar in these rapidly &#8220;Changing Times&#8221; then you will have usefull skills quite a bit beyond the average.</p>
<p>[1] What many do not realise is that &#8220;mobile&#8221; services and quite a number of &#8220;Private Mobile Radio Services&#8221; there is actually a legal requirment for the &#8220;Over The Air&#8221;(OTA) communications to be what some would call &#8220;secure&#8221; or as most would think &#8220;for privacy&#8221;. This was due to the proliferation of &#8220;scanners&#8221; back from the late 1970&#8217;s onwards, and how Newspapers would publish stories based on Audio recordings &#8220;Scanner Enthusiasts&#8221; made of newsworthy people (celebrities / politicians / Royalty, etc).</p>

				<p>@ lurker, Leon, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>Since abandoning most controls the NZ death rate is currently about 1 per million per day, which has caused some to ask if the pandemic is real</p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;death rate&#8221; is not what should be looked at to answer that.</p>
<p>Firstly because it is seldom reported accurately.</p>
<p>Secondly and more importantly death rate is a measure of pathogenicity not infection.</p>
<p>So they should be looking at the &#8220;Infection Rate&#8221; which for Omicron B2 is quite high in both NZ and Aus.</p>
<p>There are graphs you can look at online that show just how fast things are ripping through populations where the figures are reported.</p>
<p>Which it the third problem&#8230;</p>
<p>For instance in the UK we know that the curent infection rate is about 1 person in every 25, or 4% of the population. Which is the worst infection rate we&#8217;ve seen in the entire pandemic, but other places are worse. The problem is as the &#8220;official figures&#8221; are incorrectly recorded or not recorded at all it looks better than it realy is.</p>
<p>Oh and for those talking about &#8220;Death Rates&#8221; just remember, that work at the University of Washington found that the under reporting world wide is atleast by a factor of three&#8230; That is the real number of deaths is up in 20million and it&#8217;s getting worse daily.</p>

				<p>It seems improbable that the death rate in NZ could stay at 1 million per day for very long.</p>
<p>National population estimates: At 30 June 2021 | Stats NZ<br />
<a href="https://www.stats.govt.nz" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.stats.govt.nz</a> › information-releases › national-population-estimates-at-30-june-2021<br />
New Zealand&#8217;s estimated resident population was provisionally 5,122,600 there were 2,542,600 males and 2,580,000 females</p>
<p>I fondly recall 30 years ago hearing that an area of Brazilan rainforest equal in size to the State of Washington was being cleared every day. Needless to say, I called fermented grass clippings on the claim. It would be useful to see a graph of the actual rate. And the environmental impact of all that soil washing into rivers. They are sure to be happy about the price of beef and commodities these days.</p>

				<p>@JG4<br />
One <b>per</b> million <b>per</b> day, or about five times the road traffic death rate.</p>
<p>@Clive<br />
WHO method is used for reporting deaths. It is the high infection rate that has encouraged a loony few to protect themselves from various forms of EM radiation. And yes, with self-administered RATs, and self-reported results, our &#8220;official&#8221; epidemiologists have been warning they don&#8217;t know the real numbers.</p>

				<p>Postage stamps may show where they were bought, and maybe when and other particularist data, at least for U.S. stamps.</p>
<p>A proposal shortly after 9/11 would have required ownership traceability of every new stamp, but that was not implemented and the discussion was brief.</p>
<p>However, stamps bought lately at U.S. Postal Service self-service kiosks, which accept customers&#8217; payment cards (I think both credit and debit) for payment, have codes on them. The codes are black and white dots and arabic numerals and formerly letters. There are more dot columns than numerals and letters and a column has many more dots than needed just for equivalents of the numerals and letters.</p>
<p>In one case, a potential serial murderer was arrested and denied bail because the suspect mailed threatening letters, the code showed which kiosk was the point of sale, and the kiosk&#8217;s camera showed him, with a match to a driver&#8217;s license photo. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/daniel-alfred-gallegos-taunted-cops-every-time-i-see-young-beautiful-femalesi-want-to-strangle-them" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.thedailybeast.com/daniel-alfred-gallegos-taunted-cops-every-time-i-see-young-beautiful-femalesi-want-to-strangle-them</a> , with commentary in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/d6e3vl/apparently_now_postage_stamps_are_traceable/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/d6e3vl/apparently_now_postage_stamps_are_traceable/</a> . (He pled guilty and the plea was upheld. <a href="https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-gallegos-104" rel="nofollow ugc">https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-gallegos-104</a> .)</p>
<p>I suspect there&#8217;s room to store a transaction number.</p>
<p>I saw one person&#8217;s mailing of roughly a dozen pieces using these stamps, and stamp codes were not identical. Probably they were bought in one purchase, each one a Forever stamp, so the codes may store even more information, and not just error detection or error correction. I have not seen much on the Web about them. One 29-cent design with sales in Texas shows different codes even on what seems to be a single sheet (<a href="https://www.meterstampsociety.com/news.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.meterstampsociety.com/news.html</a> and to similar effect about apparently sharing a sheet see also <a href="https://www.ateeme.net/anglesw/ausa_apc.htm" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.ateeme.net/anglesw/ausa_apc.htm</a>). The dot codes seem to be Data Matrix 2D barcodes. <a href="https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/901-Zebras-and-Dots.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/901-Zebras-and-Dots.html</a> .</p>
<p>One person buying stamps for someone else could create a problem.</p>
<p>I doubt stamps sold at post office windows have those codes or anything like them, although maybe they could in the phosphor overlays meant to support scanning for face value. Old stamps without phosphor overlays are generally still valid for postage; and I&#8217;ve bought some without paying much over face value for mint stamps, but they can be annoying to buy and use, especially if you need glue.</p>
<p>Canada has something similar. <a href="https://www.meterstampsociety.com/news.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.meterstampsociety.com/news.html</a> .</p>

<p>All US mail/letters scanned and on both sides, scans recorded and stored. Just FYI.</p>
<p>Stamps may contain inside fingerprint of the person who attached it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, can’t provide link, but as I recall in Japan was developed the machine which could read the content in folded letter placed in sealed envelope without opening it.</p>

<p>”But the most insidious aspect of SSSS is that it is completely undetectable by those being targeted. Because it delivers its subliminal programming directly to the human brain via the auditory sense at frequencies that humans are incapable of perceiving as sound, there is no defense against it. Everyone on the planet is equally susceptible to mind control via SSSS and there isn’t any escape from it, as the UHF waves can be transmitted over very long distances from remotely located sources and will pass through walls and other objects as if they are not there.” Super tool for gaslighting of person who have a courage to have own thoughts.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you hear something and next person to you don’t, you are either delusional or see above.</p>

”Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching.” I guess the same applied to posts on this blog – be respectful even nobody (except collective O’Brien -1984) could know your identity. Happy weekend!</p>

<p>Informed Delivery</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great cover story.</p>
<p>The scanning is now decades old.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how the tech works, but I heard about this long ago, from insiders, that the contents could be read from the outside.</p>
<p>Guessing something like NFC or X-ray diffraction.  THe tech could read folded paper inside an envelope, and discern the writing in layers.</p>
<p>I have no doubt this exists.</p>

				<p>There are a few methods for following stamps.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>In Australia, Mr Deripaska and Rusal remained unsanctioned, prompting Transparency International Australia&#8217;s CEO Serena Lillywhite to tell Four Corners: &#8220;No individual or company that is sanctioned, as is the case with Mr Deripaska – there are personal [US] sanctions against him – should be allowed to do business in Australia&#8221;.</p>
<p>The call fell on deaf ears, until Russia&#8217;s invasion of Crimea prompted fresh scrutiny of Mr Deripaska&#8217;s Australian investment.</p>
<p>It was only on Friday, after questions were being asked in the media about Mr Deripaska&#8217;s omission, that he was added to Australia&#8217;s list.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Marise Payne rejected allegations the government was too slow to target Mr Deripaska.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Australians would expect that their government would want the due diligence done on sanctions processes, no matter where they apply, to make sure that we are addressing all those issues.&#8221;<br />
<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-18/russian-oligarch-oleg-deripaska-sanctions-ukraine-war/100921146" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-18/russian-oligarch-oleg-deripaska-sanctions-ukraine-war/100921146</a></p>
<p>In what appeared to be a bureaucratic hiccup, the initial statement from the United States included Australia on the list. But Australia could not sign up to coordinated sanctions for a simple reason: It is yet to pass its own legislation in the vein of America’s Magnitsky Act.<br />
<a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/australia-under-pressure-implement-magnitsky-style-laws" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/australia-under-pressure-implement-magnitsky-style-laws</a></p>
<p>Australia welcomed the sanctions in a joint statement with New Zealand, but it put no sanctions of it&#8217;s own in place.<br />
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/02/australia-to-face-pressure-to-use-new-magnitsky-style-laws-against-myanmar-and-chinese-officials" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/02/australia-to-face-pressure-to-use-new-magnitsky-style-laws-against-myanmar-and-chinese-officials</a></p>
<p>The government is likely to pass the law eventually but “it seems it’s not at the top of the priority list and probably won’t be for some time,”</p>
<p>“If the legislation passes, there will be pressure within the government to use it.”</p>
<p>When asked why the administration hadn’t introduced the bill, Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne remained non-commital. “The government will continue to determine the path forward and respond when it’s able to do so,” she told a parliamentary hearing.</p>
<p>The Autonomous Sanctions Amendment (Magnitsky-style and Other Thematic Sanctions) Bill 2021 (the Act) commenced on 8 December 2021.<br />
<a href="https://www.dfat.gov.au/news/news/autonomous-sanctions-amendment-magnitsky-style-and-other-thematic-sanctions-act-2021" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.dfat.gov.au/news/news/autonomous-sanctions-amendment-magnitsky-style-and-other-thematic-sanctions-act-2021</a></p>
<p><em>Australia is yet to use it&#8217;s Magnitsky powers, relying on older sanctions powers which are less effective at directly targeting individuals.</em></p>
<p>Rusal remains unsanctioned here.</p>

<p>I am smelling an APT inside SIM that Factory Reset will not clear.</p>
<p>Maybe I am just confused.</p>
<p>Maybe it is just a defect in the Silicon.</p>
<p>Maybe it was due to Cosmic Rays.<br />
`<br />
I get these texts from a 5 digit number, but I can not delete them.</p>
<p>I have done Factory Reset 3 times in past 10 days, and this keeps happening.</p>
<p>The only way to clear, is Factory Reset.</p>
<p>I am sure I will get another text from the same number within 48 hours.  Have seen for years now.</p>
<p>It is always right wing, gun control propaganda.</p>
<p>I probably should just get a new SIM, and see what happens.</p>

				<p><b>After retiring Bitdefender Free, Bitdefender launches Antivirus Free for Windows</b></p>
<p>Security company Bitdefender announced last year that it would retire Bitdefender Free at the end of 2021. Now, three months later, the company launched a new free product, called Bitdefender Antivirus Free.</p>
<p>In a surprising move, Bitdefender launched a new free antivirus product for Windows after cancelling the old one just three months earlier.</p>
<p>The company announced the launch of Bitdefender Antivirus Free on the company blog. The blog post reveals that the program has been created from the ground up. Bitdefender Antivirus Free &#8220;offers enhanced features, functionality, and improved user experience in comparison to the previous free version&#8221; according to Bitdefender.</p>
<p>The free section of the Bitdefender website does not list the new product yet. You need to visit this link to open the page with the download link. The download is small, but the installer requires an Internet connection and will download more than 500 Megabytes when it is run, provided that you allow it to do so.</p>
<p>The version requires a Bitdefender account. A sign-up and sign-in form is displayed on first run. Users who don&#8217;t want to create an account just for that can uninstall the antivirus product right after installation again as there is no option to use it without an account.</p>
<p>According to Bitdefender, the new antivirus adds Outlook and Thunderbird email protection, custom scanning schedule options, and exploit detection to the protective features.</p>
<p>The free version protects against all advanced threats according to Bitdefender. Several features, such as ransomware remediation, vulnerability scanning or a firewall are not included in the free version.</p>
<p>The free version includes antivirus protection, including on demand scanning of devices it is installed on, web protection, and advanced threat defense, which attempts to block zero-day attacks.</p>
<p>The interface is easy to use, but many of the options are locked for free users. The dashboard displays two actions, quick scan and system scan, that are available in the free version, and three, vulnerability scan, VPN and Safepay, that are not.</p>
<p>There are multiple upgrade buttons in the interface, and selecting any of the locked options will also display upgrade options. Users may also be notified about special offers and recommendations by default, which can be disabled in the options.</p>
<p>Closing Words</p>
<p>Bitdefender received quite a bit of backlash when it announced the end of the free antivirus solution. If it would have waited with the announcement until the new free product would have been ready, many users might not have taken the announcement that badly.</p>
<p>Bitdefender Antivirus Free offers basic protection against certain types of threats. Good news is that it uses the same antivirus engine as the paid products, and Bitdefender has scored highly in all recent tests.</p>
<p>The program may be an option for users who don&#8217;t mind the missing features and regular reminders about the paid upgrade options. Free trial options are available for users who want to test the extra features without having to part with their money right away.</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm,</p>
<blockquote><p>I get these texts from a 5 digit number, but I can not delete them.</p></blockquote>
<p>What we call &#8220;texts&#8221; or &#8220;SMSs&#8221; were actually an accident&#8230;</p>
<p>The underlying system was for updates for the SIM and Phone Base Band unit (the non-smart part of your phone). So things like User Intetface stuff like Network Provider logos and ring tones and other &#8220;Marketing Support&#8221; and similar junk could be sent to your phone by your &#8220;service provider&#8221;. As an underlying &#8220;engineering / maintanence system&#8221; they were not designed to be &#8220;deleted&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>The fact somebody worked out how to repurpose the system so users could send a hundred or so characters of text to each other was just &#8220;A late stage add on / after thought&#8221;. Some claim was started as a way to get in on the then very profitable pager market (if it was then it was both wildly successful and eye-wateringly profitable for oh a quater of a century or so).</p>
<p>In part this story is supported by the fact that the text system is &#8220;secondary traffic&#8221; with no guarentee of delivery let alone timely delivery. Not even &#8220;best effort&#8221;[1].</p>
<p>As a very rough rule of thumb, those 5digit numbers originate from your Service Provider as they are not &#8220;circuit traffic&#8221; originated.</p>
<p>Some service providers sell &#8220;bulk SMS&#8221; services to organisations that do &#8220;regional messaging&#8221; like traffic, weather, sports scores etc updates, even &#8220;Emergancy Service&#8221;. Some services are parallel feed or &#8220;General Broadcast&#8221;. That is all phones in the same cell get the message irrespective of the phones numbers or user prefrences (yes even turning SMS Off does not always stop them).</p>
<p>The fact you can not delete them suggests either,</p>
<p>1, Your phone brand/model/update has a bug.<br />
2, Someone is playing fast and loose with the service settings.</p>
<p>Either way, they are unlikely to stop&#8230; Unless it&#8217;s the latter and you take it up with your Service Provider, or better still swap to another service provider and take your number with you.</p>
<p>[1] I&#8217;ve mentioned before that back last century before Smart devices were even a twinkle in marketings eyes, I had decided to use SMS as a side channel for security with Banking and similar online systems on PC&#8217;s. But I ran into the secondary traffic and slow/non delivery issue, and partly solved it (by sending primary traffic to the phone so the network was forced to find the phone thus would know where to send the SMS rather than just cache it).</p>

				<p>@ SpaceLifeForm, @ vas pup, Nick Levinson</p>
<p>re: <i>I’m not sure how the tech works &#8230; the contents could be read from the outside. </i></p>
<p>There are several versions of how this can be done now, I dunno how it was done then without steaming the envelope (see Banksy Spy Booth).</p>
<p>Historical documents use a variety of inks and those inks have chemical signatures. By isolating the chemical trace for each ink ingredient the letter, font design and images can be read.</p>
<p>That same thing can be done for paintings. They can trace the chemical signatures of the paints used and often track them to their source of origin.  In ancient times, artists had to roll-their-own paints and colors.  This is still commonly done by historical preservers, forgers and historical recreation specialists.</p>
<p>Now there are special scanners (X-Ray etc) that can be set to read just a filament slice of the scroll and derive the letters from within that slice. They have been successful reading burnt scrolls using that sort of technique.  Think: very thin salami slices.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Search Terms</p>
<p>Iron gall ink used in Europe for the 1400-year period between the 5th and 19th centuries, remained in widespread use well into the 20th century, and is still sold today.</p>

				<p>@ ResearcherZero, vas pup,</p>
<blockquote><p>I had a pal who used to communicate with Satan via the television screen.</p></blockquote>
<p>I once worked for a very friendly company that unfortunately got taken over by a ball of 541t&#8230;</p>
<p>The new corporate owners a very large publishing (ie Journals) Mega-Corp set the Human Resources people onto the &#8220;taken over staff&#8221;.</p>
<p>Not only did it feel like &#8220;A night of the long toothed zombies&#8221; horror flick, the HR people would not communicate&#8230; You got &#8220;Hellish edicts&#8221; handed out like &#8220;Satan&#8217;s spawn&#8221; that you could not stop and like bullets from a robot machine gun, they came fast and furious and only in one direction&#8230;</p>
<p>Basicall You would get Emails that you could not as such reply to as they used &#8220;setver lists&#8221; and &#8220;holiday mode&#8221; to bounce any replys&#8230; Likewise the HR phones all went to &#8220;out of office&#8221; messages that then did not alow you to leave a message, just flipped you to a phone that was permanently &#8220;engaged&#8221;, so you got that automated message of &#8220;The person you are calling knows you are calling, and you are number one in the que&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well as the HR droids found out the hard way more than one person can play that game&#8230; And some play to win no cheats exempted&#8230;</p>
<p>For some reason one night an auto-update and re-configure went out that &#8220;accidently&#8221; set the &#8220;holiday mode&#8221; on all users email clients&#8230;</p>
<p>The following morning long before &#8220;Sparrow F4rt&#8221; when HR&#8217;s latest Devil Spawn bunch of Emails got auto-sent, the entire network rapidly dropped to it&#8217;s knees and for a short while crawled to a death march pace, and then keeled over faster than a fainting goat&#8230;</p>
<p>Some of you have probably heard about &#8220;Ping Storms&#8221; as a DDoS attack, well back then if you sent out a bulk Email and all the recipents did a &#8220;Reply to All&#8221; with an automated &#8220;out of Office&#8221; message then you got N^2 multiplication with every round, and the rounds were automatically endless, limited only by network capacity&#8230; I gather a few &#8220;seniors&#8221; were mightily upset by this, so demanded &#8220;Action this day&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>But the Net-Admins were not able to help other than say they would have to disconnect all effected computers from the network. The Email server SysAdmins were likewise unable to help, and unfortunately the way things had been set up the &#8220;tech support&#8221; people for users desktops could not do anything either as they could only send new updates to an automated delivery system that only sent them &#8220;at night&#8221;&#8230; With the admin of that service being out that morning with a dental appointment&#8230;</p>
<p>For some reason, with nobody able to do any work, it was not &#8220;a quiet day in the office&#8221;&#8230; Many assumed that it must have been the update service admin, but as he pointed out, he had not logged in to the service or sent any updates etc so not him.</p>
<p>Anyway, as I said a few &#8220;seniors&#8221; were mightily upset&#8230; So they payed a very very very expensive firm of consultants to come in immediately and find out what had happened with a view to a publicl evisceration of the culprit when found. The oh so expensive consultants apparently spent the weekend going through all the computers with the proverbial &#8220;fine tooth comb&#8221; or as we used to call them &#8220;bug rake&#8221;[1]&#8230;</p>
<p>Apparently all they found were some &#8220;time holes&#8221; in system logs, and some disk sectors in the free list that had been zeroed out&#8230; And very little else&#8230; I guess someone was as smart if not smarter than the ultra expensive consultants&#8230;</p>
<p>A couple of years later I was reminded about the incident because in the IT news it was reported that a serious bug[2] had come to light when someone was caught using it to &#8220;make their employer pay&#8221; (and was dumb enough to get caught).</p>
<p>[1] Half a century ago, schools regularly had plagues of &#8220;knits&#8221; or &#8220;hair lice/mites&#8221; whilst there were treatments back then you had to go visit a Dr to get a perscription, that only killed the adult knits. So part of the two week treatment was to comb out the eggs at the base of the hairs with a &#8220;knit comb&#8221; atleast twice a day. This was a very &#8220;fine toothed comb&#8221; and as you used it like a garden rake, you sometimes also raked out live mites so it got called a &#8220;bug rake&#8221;. If you can imagine what happens when it hits knotted hair, you can imagine why it was detested&#8230; I was lucky in that I never got knits, but as I have very fine hair, I did not like using the aluminium combs that were popular at the time. So the soft plastic &#8220;bug rake&#8221; was better than the metal comb for me, so I tended to use it most of the time.</p>
<p>[2] It was a little known bug with Microsoft&#8217;s equivalent of &#8220;cron&#8221; called &#8220;at&#8221;[3] in that a user could get it to run a simple command that would startup a command shell&#8230; So if you went to a system console and set it up to run a command shell in say two minutes, and then you waited, you got a command shell owned and with all the privileges of SYSTEM (the MS equivalent of the local superuser, which is kind of bad news on a privileged server&#8230;). The odd thing is that this was a &#8220;known problem&#8221; way back last century with &#8220;cron&#8221; in the early days of *nix&#8230; So why MS did not test for it years later with NT is anybodies guess&#8230; It only took very minimal skills to find, and so I suspect it must have been known to several people.</p>
<p>For instance &#8220;Pen-Testers&#8221; tend to be a bit &#8220;dishonest&#8221; in that they keep a few tricks &#8211;aka zero-days&#8211;<br />
 in their bag they do not tell clients or vendors about. Because it gives them &#8220;Market Advantage&#8221; thus repeate work (Consultants do the same thing, in that they only solve say 80% of your problem, thus they get to make a second bite of the apple as repeate business).</p>

				<p>@vas pup, @SpaceLifeForm, @ResearcherZero, &amp; @JonKnowsNothing:</p>
<p>Scanning inside unopened envelopes was, in a British system decades ago, perhaps during WWII, by using a very bright light and a camera with a very shallow depth of field, with a series of photos, each focused on a different layer of the folded paper. This was sketched out in a public source very critical of the CIA, perhaps CovertAction Information Bulletin or CounterSpy.</p>
<p>In the U.S., unless for national self-defense or not first class, this might require a court warrant even without opening the envelope, and then a court warrant could authorize covertly opening anyway. I imagine warrants don&#8217;t normally specify the means of executing the warrant, so that the choice of opening or scanning would be at the prerogative of the searcher.</p>
<p>It also is tedious work, especially when paper isn&#8217;t quite flat and if squeezing the envelope between glass sheets doesn&#8217;t flatten it enough. This may raise doubts about how many mail pieces someone could thus scan in an hour. Philip Agee&#8217;s book Inside the Company discusses opening mail where he was stationed, not this kind of scanning, which should already have been available, and I think the opening was at the embassy, where such equipment could have been kept.</p>
<p>Maybe the system didn&#8217;t work very well. If lenses with that shallow a depth of field aren&#8217;t widely available in 2022, and I don&#8217;t see why they wouldn&#8217;t be, such as for studies in biology or human health, maybe they don&#8217;t work very well even now.</p>
<p>And erasure-caused smudges could be hard to distinguish from adjacent sheets that are fuzzy because they&#8217;re slightly outside the depth of field even without trying to read the pre-erasure content, unless the depth of field was so shallow that there was virtually no next-sheet imagery to confuse an observer looking at the area of the smudge, but then even a slight bend of the paper would require even more photos.</p>
<p>On a fingerprint being on the stamp: Yes, front and back. Also DNA.</p>
<p>Informed Delivery: The U.S.P.S. also televises handwritten envelope obverses through a closed circuit so a clerk in someplace like North Carolina can type addresses into a terminal and a machine can imprint the proper delivery barcode or can return the envelope to the sender as undeliverable even before it would get to the delivery post office, which might have recognized the address and the addressee and delivered it.</p>
<p>I think the U.S.P.S. Zip code database, which publicly is based on addresses, may, for internal use of the U.S.P.S., have names of who&#8217;s at each address, and not just for PO Boxes. If you attempt to renew forwarding for a name past a time limit, attempts fail, even for apartment houses. They likely barcode to the address line, but I don&#8217;t know if they barcode to the addressee organizaiton, last name, or person.</p>

				<p>Human resilience is limited in scope, and the persistent barrage of million monkeys on typewriters continues unabated. Shakespeare would not be jealous in the lest. The following is strongly worded and expresses more passion than most find readable&#8211;it is not an abuse of language though, except a mangled word appearing as the second to last word. And they are all my words, strung together to form a&#8230;</p>
<p>The ABA is setting its historical predation of jurist prudence and contempt for professional ethics into stone. As a profession, a number lawyers and attorneys are demonstrating a dual contempt; one for the duty to the truth and justice, the other is for the institutions required to populate seats for judicial officers to the court. History will reflect that utter banality precedent, the disgorgment of trust, and the role in society one might think necessary for civility, and how law and its practice plays a major role. Of course no amount of legal judicial system or systems can survive first contact with a deliberate war upon itself.</p>
<p>It will be a pleasure to write the history of the legal practice in the U.S. and the large part played by the licensers and those practicing law in a malevolent manner and all the while testing and exceeding the boundaries of legal malpractice. The level of embarrassment and dishonor the legal profession is bestowing onto itself is simply stunning. It would be worthy or a Shakespearian play if it werent for the fact that even Shakespeare had limits to his satire.</p>
<p>To me, the flight from the &#8220;rule of law&#8221; to the &#8220;law of the jungle&#8221; has landed, we are now all captives to a world of animalist omnovores preying on the least resistent. A mad and devolved (ironically) form of beastial pursuits will pass as our collective enterprise. Art, beauty, truth, and a humble humanity capable of love is gone&#8230;thank you, you f&#8217;ing psychopaths</p>

				<p>@Clive<br />
&#8220;So I guess the real issue is,</p>
<p>1, Spotting a bad leader.<br />
2, Dethroning them quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plato wrote the book about rulers and politics which set the question for 2 millenniums:<br />
Who should rule? Or, what is the ideal ruler?</p>
<p>In the 20th century, Karl Popper argued convincingly that this was entirely the wrong question. The real question is: How can we get rid of rulers?</p>
<p>What brings down every empire, authocracy, dictatorships, and tyranny is the fact that there is no sane way of retiring rulers that have outlived their usefulness, or even sanity.</p>
<p>Putin will be the next textbook example of this question.</p>

				<p>@ Leon Theremin, Hung, ALL,</p>
<p>With regards,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;‘Sound beaming’ 3-D technology from Noveto Systems tracks ear and sends it audio using ultrasonic waves, creating personal listening pockets”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>You need to note there are two parts to this system,</p>
<p>1, The tracking system.<br />
2, The directed projection system.</p>
<p>There is actually very little that is either new or patentable in either part.</p>
<p>As readers here will know automated tracking systems have been improving steadily for the past couple of decades. So much so that &#8220;surveillance systems&#8221; can tell what your hands are doing through a brick wall by signals emitted from WiFi systems. Such tech has turned up in gaming console systems over the years but has been somewhat crude in resolution. The think about such systems is once you&#8217;ve cracked the basics, getting better resolution follows as technology becomes more focused and the VR industry has been desperately chasing tracking for the past couple of decades for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>As for the projection system&#8230;</p>
<p>It uses constructive interferance, and a technique that goes back to WWII and radio navigation systems for bombers which got titled &#8220;the battle of the beams&#8221; by Prof R.V.Jones in his early 1970&#8217;s book &#8220;Most Secret War&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned on this blog in the past many years ago I was involved with a project that spun out of work to try to make underwater holographic images by the use of ultrasonics.</p>
<p>Holographs are produced by the interference patterns of two wave fronts from &#8220;wave based radiative energy sources&#8221; those we see use coherent light sources (often lasers) that then get split one directed at the &#8220;object&#8221; and one directed at the recording media. The reflection from the object also gets directed at the recording media. The result is the media records an interferance pattern. This pattern when later illuminated with a coherant source, makes the interferance pattern work in reverse, thus the object image appears to be projected out of the recording media. Obviously what you csn do with coherant light you can do with other coherant radiative sources.</p>
<p>The idea was in a water tank used for testing ships hulls coherant sound in the form of millimetric ultrasound would be used instead of light thus a holographic image could be recorded and played back in a visable form. The problem was the technology of four decades ago was not upto making an effective recording media&#8230;</p>
<p>But during the experiments a side effect was noted, the technicians could develop intense itching, enough for them to scratch themselves raw and bleed.</p>
<p>Investigation showed that the constructive interferance was causing the ultrasound to be demodulated in the nerve endings just under the skin[1]. Further investigation showed that nerve signals could be &#8220;controled&#8221; enough to induce fits similar to those experienced by those suffering from epilepsy.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into the details as someone will no doubt pop up and complain if I do, as they have done in the past and echos take time to die away&#8230; But a demonstration system of a &#8220;non-leathal weapon&#8221; using the principle was slightly changed, and could render imdividual pigs in a field not just unconcious but dead more than a thousand feet away&#8230;</p>
<p>But as with most technological discoveries,</p>
<p>1, You can not &#8220;unring the bell&#8221;.<br />
2, Stop the &#8220;trickle down effect&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why I&#8217;m very cautious about LRAD[2] devices that use similar directed coherent sound sources.</p>
<p>I suspect that should this Noveto system get put in the consumer market place it will have unanticipated neurological effects or be easily made to do so.</p>
<p>But&#8230; Like my crude holographic touch system, the Noveto system will almost certainly suffer from an object shadow problem. In a room with support columns or other things in it if you wear real head phones it does not matter where you move, the sound will reach your ears. However with projection systems, anything in the way &#8220;blocks the beam&#8221; or part of it and the sound you hear will be at best down graded. It&#8217;s not a problem that is easy to fix, and in some case can not be&#8230;</p>
<p>So my advice &#8220;don&#8217;t put your money&#8221; anywhere close to it, oh and stay away from them as nurological harms and issues can be hard to make good.</p>
<p>[1] Quite a few years ago now I did a little personal research into this effect and found you could induce feelings much like touching things. It was very crude but holding your hand open to the ultrasound sources you could kind of feel not just textures but large shapes. As I indicated to some money people at the time, with refinment the technology would add &#8220;virtual touch&#8221; in what we now call a &#8220;VR Environment&#8221; but without the &#8220;clunky gloves&#8221;. The trouble was I was to honest with my time scale projections&#8230;</p>
<p>[2] Let&#8217;s just say I can see the &#8220;path followed&#8221; to get to, C Vigil Maratime and their,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cvigil.co.uk/pdf/Klarion%20Brochure.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.cvigil.co.uk/pdf/Klarion%20Brochure.pdf</a></p>
<p>Oh and how to make it work slightly differently&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>‘have to become China’s colony’</p></blockquote>
<p>A little context around that quote might help:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;If he survives, he&#8217;s going to have to become China&#8217;s colony at this point.<br />
&#8220;That&#8217;s the only way he&#8217;s going to get the financial support he needs to survive.<br />
&#8220;And it&#8217;s not a sure thing that the Chinese are going to want to do that. It&#8217;s a really bad situation.<br />
&#8220;It is in their interest, provided the war doesn&#8217;t go nuclear.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note all the conditionals in there. In particular the last &#8220;their&#8221;. In whose interest? Without being present at the conversation it&#8217;s difficult to say. Note that this is the opinion of one man, &#8220;Harry Kazianis, an expert on US foreign policy and national security issues involving China&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr. Kazianis apparently hasn&#8217;t asked the Chinese for their opinion. China at present is standing back and watching, as befits somone who only wants to pick over the bones afterwards, and leave the rest to rot.</p>

<p>How is that Random working for you today?</p>
<p>How will that Random work for you later?</p>
<p>It is a fairly long and technical read, but recommended.  Today is Sunday.</p>
<p>hxtps://www.zx2c4.com/projects/linux-rng-5.17-5.18/</p>
<blockquote><p>
The random number generator has undergone a few important changes for Linux 5.17 and 5.18, in an attempt to modernize both the code and the cryptography used. The smaller part of these will be released with 5.17 on Sunday, while the larger part will be merged into 5.18 on Monday, which should receive its first release candidate in a few weeks and a release in a few months.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>However, since we just keep track of a single counter, a single malicious entropy source could be responsible for all of the credits except for the one or two or forty or so that an attacker would then bruteforce. Typical solutions to this usually involve something like the “Fortuna” scheduler,

				<p>Network Security questions</p>
<p>What does it really, truly mean that a user is authenticated in a networked environment?</p>
<p>Are we really sure that a security token passed over a communications network can really be trusted by a server?</p>
<p>Are you sure your security token has not been captured by malware?</p>
<p>How long should a security token be valid?</p>
<p>How much seasoning should be applied before one passes the hash?</p>
<p>There are no simple answers.</p>

<blockquote><p>
“Schemes like Passkey could work and be more secure than passwords as they stand now,” says Johns Hopkins cryptographer Matthew Green. “But if the user interface for inter-device transfers sucks on some devices, it will suck for all of them, which would continue to discourage use.”

				<p>@ lurker,</p>
<blockquote><p>In particular the last “their”. In whose interest? Without being present at the conversation it’s difficult to say.</p></blockquote>
<p>You pull in the opposite direction to me..</p>
<p>Where I asked with respect to the Russian citizens,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Will it be any different than being a colony for arguing oligarchs, mafia and the corrupt as they currently are?&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>You go with,</p>
<blockquote><p>China at present is standing back and watching, as befits somone who only wants to pick over the bones afterwards, and leave the rest to rot.</p></blockquote>
<p>It will be interesting to watch this from the side lines. However I suspect it will be protracted maybe more than half a decade of conflict.</p>
<p>Eventually Russia will fail to have the whole of the Ukraine, but I suspect that the politicians of the &#8220;intetnational community&#8221; will &#8220;sell them out&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reason is simple, as Putin is fully aware, the world needs Russian raw resources. The various economies in the world, especially the Western ones need those resources be the food, energy or feedstock. Thus their politicians will compromise any integrity they have just like drug addicts who attack the weak and inferm to get their next fix.</p>
<p>The solution to Putin is directly through Putin, not through the Russian people. Who let&#8217;s face it are so cognatively biased, they will believe any nonsense Putin pushes out rather than admit Putin has repratedly made fools of them.</p>
<p>Putin has shown he has no respect for International law, by sending out hit squads under his personal authority to kill those abroad he does not like or see as a threat.</p>
<p>As he started walking down that path&#8230;</p>
<p>If you remember back the US&#8217;s Paul Bremer, under the Bush Executive put a price on Sadam Hussain&#8217;s head, nearly two decades ago. The &#8220;dead or alive&#8221; bounty was a mear $25,000,000 and $15,000,000 for each of his children, and surprise suprise people called to collect. So how much is Putin&#8217;s head worth? and those of his more extensive family in comparison?</p>
<p>As the US can legally grab the money stolen by Putin and his cronies that they have &#8220;stashed abroad&#8221; in the US and other places, it&#8217;s not as though it&#8217;s going to be the US tax payer that will be stumping up the cash for any bounty on Putin and Co&#8217;s heads.</p>
<p>Is it a bad idea? Yes such things always have blow back effects. Would it do the Russian people a worthwhile service? Probably. As for the Ukranians and the Belarusians almost certainly yes.</p>
<p>The issue is how to deal with the &#8220;power vaccum&#8221; that would arise, there are ways to make that work provided you can stop the Russian predilection to corruption from causing the same nonsense to arise again.</p>
<p>My own view starts however at the Security Council of the UN, for stability to happen, the permanent members and their veto powers have to go, no ifs, buts or maybes.</p>

I asked a couple of weeks ago where was the policeman to arrest P for his war crimes, but that post got the kiss of death, perhaps because I quoted the UKR UN ambassador. Somebody else also posted about him later and it stayed up about two hours. Is he <i>persona non grata</i> here?</p>

&#8220;The reason is simple, as Putin is fully aware, the world needs Russian raw resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>The world needs the resources, but they do not need the Russians.</p>
<p>I think the &#8220;world&#8221; (i.e., Europe) has listened to Putin&#8217;s rants and realized that he is an immediate, lethal threat to all of Europe. That doing business with Putin is financing your own murder. Europe has waken up to a real world staging of<br />

<p>eff ess bee is a spam filter eh eye issue</p>
<p>Yep.  Because I blockquoted the tweet that had the magic keyword, it did not get thru the spam filter. THe post with the blockquote was &#8216;held for moderation&#8217;.  But you can read it, if you follow the link.</p>
<p>The spam filter eh eye is psychopathic.</p>
<p>It is stupid if it thinks a three letter acronym is bad , even when that is known to everyone,</p>

				<p>@ lurker,</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked a couple of weeks ago&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a link put up about a week back to the United Nations Official TV feed of the U Amb giving a speech &#8211;that also had been seen on MSM outlets&#8211; and it to got nixed PDQ. So unless it was the same link you saw, the answer to your question might be yes&#8230;</p>

I agree with you on the veto, but I think the current permanents should stay, always at the grace and favour of the Gen Assy. Hopefully such a threat might encourage good behaviour. Apart from the ego massage, those people need to be kept in where they can be watched.</p>
