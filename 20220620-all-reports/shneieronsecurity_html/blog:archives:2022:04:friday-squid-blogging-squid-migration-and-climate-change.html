				<p>Eric Schmidt, the former Google chairman, told Reuters in a recent interview that high-end processors should have kill-switches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowing where the chips go is probably a very good thing. You could for example, on every chip put in essentially a public private key pair, which authenticates it and allows it to work&#8221;.</p>
<p>hxxps://www.reuters.com/technology/chip-challenge-keeping-western-semiconductors-out-russian-weapons-2022-04-01/</p>
<p>What he won&#8217;t tell is that this is already a reality, as I learned after having my air-gapped system and Pixel phone wiped remotely for researching &#8220;silent speech interfaces&#8221; like this:</p>
<p>SpeakUp: Silent Speech Interface; Low Cost; Arduino; Machine Learning</p>
<p>Project Summary by Varun Chandrashekhar: “I have designed and developed a speech interfaced for the paralyzed, which they can use to communicate without speaking. This device detects speech-related electrical signals from the throat and converts them into letters or words that we recognize using machine learning models.”</p>
<p>SpeakUp – ML Based Speech Aid to Enable Silent Communication<br />
hxxps://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Varun_Chandrashekhar/speakup-ml-based-speech-aid-to-enable-silent-communication-ffd9f8</p>
<p>My comment about the project: easily replicable by anyone with computer science knowledge, different from what is being done with the silicon trojans in the 3G/4G/5G equipment only on it needing physical probes. Anyone doing research on this area be cautious of sabotage when using US designed CPUs (AMD/INTEL/QUALCOMM/APPLE/ARM), as the microcode, SMM and firmware of your system may be manipulated to mess up your computations. Ask your own Nation to stop trusting Silicon Valley and make your own silicon supply chain and tech services. Meanwhile, mitigate this situation by moving to an area away from any cell radio transmitter (check coverage on OpenCellID.org) and shielding yourself and your devices from electromagnetic eavesdropping and interference.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Eric Schmidt, the former Google chairman, told Reuters in a recent interview that high-end processors should have kill-switches.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t solve social problems with technology. Wars (and invasions) are social problems. Technology won&#8217;t ever solve them.</p>
<p>If you put kill switches in things, they will be exploited and abused. &#8220;We don&#8217;t like what you are doing so we will kill your systems&#8221;. No thanks, keep your social problems out of the systems.</p>

				<p>&#8220;The threat actor used the KA-SAT management mechanism in a supply-chain attack to push a wiper designed for modems and routers. A wiper for this kind of device would overwrite key data in the modem’s flash memory, rendering it inoperable and in need of reflashing or replacing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Subsequent to this post being published, Viasat confirmed to journalists that our analysis was consistent with their reports.&#8221;<br />

<p>&#8220;Fire Chili rootkit and two compromised digital signatures, one of which we also directly linked to Winnti.&#8221;</p>
<p>several infiltrations into victim networks that were achieved via a Log4Shell exploitation of vulnerable VMware Horizon servers. These attacks spawned a new PowerShell process to download and execute a chain of scripts that ended with the installation of a malicious DLL.</p>
<p>The rootkits are digitally signed with certificates stolen from game development companies, which is a known characteristic of Winnti.<br />

<p>The first sighting of three of the nine stolen certificates being used maliciously occurred in early 2014. Those three certificates were the only ones used in 2014, making it likely that the other six were not compromised until 2015. All nine certificates were used maliciously in 2015.</p>
<p>&#8230;the first certificates used belonged to Company A (educational software developer) and Company B (video game developer #2). Company A&#8217;s certificate was used for over a year, from April 2014 until June 2015 and Company B&#8217;s certificate was used for almost a year, from July 2014 until June 2015. When we discovered this activity, neither company was aware that their certificates had been stolen or how they were being used. Since the companies were unaware of the activity, neither stolen certificate had been revoked.<br />

<p>&#8220;stealing the certificates and signing malware for future attacks against other targets was the preferred method of this group&#8221;<br />

				<p>@ Leon Theremin, ALL,</p>
<p>Re : Ex Google Chairman Eric Schmidt&#8217;s comment,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“Knowing where the chips go is probably a very good thing. You could for example, on every chip put in essentially a public private key pair, which authenticates it and allows it to work”.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s not exactly the brightest lightbulb in the corridor if he genuinely thinks that after reasoned consideration. Similar has been tried before and usually ends up failing if there is sufficient incentive&#8230;</p>
<p>Heck think back to stuxnet, and other cases where &#8220;malicious signed code&#8221; has turned up.</p>
<p>But think about the fact that nearly all the chips are not made in the US or under US Government control, nor is the equipment needed to make chips&#8230;</p>
<p>The thing is if Russia wanted to make it&#8217;s own chips there are plenty of realdundant 6 and 8 inch fabs out there not making any money, just looking for buyers. You do not need the latest high tech chips to make wrapons, in fact many weapons take so long to get through development, often the chips would be close to being EOL&#8217;d anyway.</p>
<p>But there are other issues&#8230;</p>
<p>In the UK Military there is a saying,</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t leave ammunition for the enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>And they should know&#8230; The Germans left so much 9mm ammunition about that the Brit&#8217;s designed the &#8220;SMG&#8221; also known as &#8220;the plumbers delight&#8221; especially to use it up shooting Germans&#8230;</p>
<p>Something US congress and other critters got their panties in a wad over more than half a century ago with their budding nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>Which is why there is a sort of joke about why the US needs at least three times the number of nuclear weapons anyone else does. It&#8217;s not just about &#8220;Permisive Action Links&#8221;(PALs) it&#8217;s also about all the other sillyness they add to the &#8220;physics package&#8221; to stop them being used by terrorists, rouge generals, and dumb as a stump guards that get bored and juggle with things like detonators. Oh and every other nightmare the Rand Corp could think up on the US Tax Dollar. In short most US nukes are expected to be duds when used&#8230;</p>
<p>But getting back to chips, the next bright idea down in the corridor will be to send out &#8220;kill commands&#8221;. However the thing about ICTsec and cyber-weapons is the enemy does not need any computers&#8230; Because malware actually runs on the computers being attacked&#8230;</p>
<p>So the minute you send off a kill command you can expect it to come flying back at your weapons very quickly there after.</p>
<p>Also there are known ways of stopping such attacks that have been discussed on this blog oh a decade or so ago&#8230;</p>
<p>The problem is there is no easy answer when it comes to electronics. Nearly every IoT device out there has more than enough smarts to be used in weapons. The same with Smart Phones. The simple fact is the military stopped being the primary force driving the electronics industry forward more or less fourty years ago and now well lets just say they are lucky to get the crumbs off of the consumer electronics table.</p>
<p>Take Sansung Smary Phones, it&#8217;s not widely known but like Disney Corp they find North Korea a plentiful supply of very cheap and quite skilled labour&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyone daft enough to realy push the issue will find that the nations most economically dependent on the electronics industry is the Americas and their supposed allies in the West.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why some of us had a good laugh about the &#8220;Obama Big Red Button&#8221;, then later Trumps Trade war with China, the thing is some people realy do not grok-it about &#8220;taking target practice at your own feet&#8221;.</p>

<p>EAA has other strong connections with the Coalition. Before entering parliament, Angus Taylor was a director of the company between 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p>The deal for $79m was signed in July last year, allowing EAA to report a large uplift in the value of its water rights. It booked a $52m gain on the water rights sold and a $40m uplift in the value of its water licences.<br />

				<p>@ ResearcherZero, SpaceLifeForm, ALL</p>
<p>With regards,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;“The threat actor used the KA-SAT management mechanism in a supply-chain attack to push a wiper designed for modems and routers&#8230;&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Old News&#8230;</p>
<p>I worked it out it was probably a TechSupport managment vulnerabilityvas soon ad I heard about the effected coverage are. Then within a second or two of hearing that a master reset worked, I knew the rest of the probable story. @SpaceLifeForm and myself have exchanged thoughts on it a few days back, it is after all not the first time this sort of thing has happened.</p>
<p>The reality is the only thing that is kind of new is that it&#8217;s been done during an active conflict in Europe.</p>
<p>The earliest you might remember about tech support managment going bad was the CarrierIQ debacal on US mobile phones.</p>
<p>Then there was all those set top routers with a managment port out to the ISP WAN with default passwords.</p>
<p>And the list goes on.</p>
<p>All that realy suprises me is that these KA-Sat Terms are the only thing in the conflict notably effectiveted that the MSM has reported. But also it may be because not a lot else has been attacked that way so far&#8230; I was kind of expecting most of the infrastructure grids to have been realy whacked.</p>
<p>I guess some people have learnt from earlier lessons, which is a bit of a suprise the way the ICTsec industry usually behaves.</p>
<p>Mind you I do know that at one point the UK was the world leader on pushing to get infrastructure hardened, but&#8230;</p>

<p>These morons and their backdoors. Ye Gods!</p>
<p>No sooner than the CIA would backdoor something, then the Russian secret services used to find it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here use this, it&#8217;s encrypted.&#8221; Then a couple weeks later, &#8220;don&#8217;t use that, the Russians have been intercepting all messages passed over it!&#8221;</p>
<p>(No s**t, we kind of noticed the bullets.)</p>
<p>Far safer to encrypt a message yourself, and then pass it along to someone prearranged. Even the hokey terrorists do that and their security is terrible.</p>

				<p>We all remember this don&#8217;t we? How can anyone forget is the question?</p>
<p>&#8220;Senators and House members have now sent a letter to the NSA in an effort to learn more about the agency’s role in the Juniper incident.&#8221;</p>
<p>In their letter, the lawmakers noted that the Juniper backdoor may have allowed a foreign government or a different adversary to hack into the communications of many businesses and government agencies. They have asked the NSA to describe the steps it took following the disclosure of the Juniper incident to protect government agencies, and why those measures haven’t prevented the recent SolarWinds supply chain attack.<br />
<a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/012921%20Wyden%20Booker%20Letter%20to%20NSA%20RE%20SolarWinds%20Juniper%20Hacks.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/012921%20Wyden%20Booker%20Letter%20to%20NSA%20RE%20SolarWinds%20Juniper%20Hacks.pdf</a></p>
<p>How to log into any backdoored Juniper firewall</p>
<p>an employee of Fox-IT stated that they were able to identify the backdoor password in six hours<br />

<p>This module scans for the Juniper SSH backdoor (also valid on Telnet). Any username is required, and the password is &lt;&lt;&lt; %s(un=&#039;%s&#039;) = %u<br />

<p>Decrypting protected data passing through the VPN</p>
<p>Juniper actually added the insecure algorithm to its software long after the more secure ANSI algorithm was already in it, raising questions about why the company would have knowingly undermined an already secure system.</p>
<p>Checkoway discovered that the company made an additional change to its software when it added Dual_EC, a change that made it even easier for the person who later installed the backdoor to decrypt Juniper&#039;s VPN traffic. This change involved altering the size or length of the so-called nonce (the random number string generated by the algorithm that the encryption scheme uses to help encrypt data). Juniper changed the size of the nonce from 20 bytes&#8212;the size it had been using for the ANSI algorithm&#8212;to 32 bytes.<br />

<p>That new nonce, 32 bytes, is the precise size the security community had specified in 2007 would be the ideal minimal output an attacker would need to undermine Dual_EC.<br />

				<p>@ ResearcherZero,</p>
<blockquote><p>No sooner than the CIA would backdoor something, then the Russian secret services used to find it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The $64,000 question,</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they actually &#8220;find it&#8221; or were they &#8220;told about it&#8221;?</p>
<p>If you remember back half a decadecade ago, the CIA lost a whole bunch of people in Iran and China. At the time the story was not entirely lucid but,</p>
<p>Aparantly the CIA came up with a new CovComm way for agents to communicate back to their agency handlers via what some called an &#8220;Internet App&#8221;. The reasoning for the app is confused some saying it was for new untrusted agents, others say it was due to advances,in &#8220;technology&#8221; apparently there was to much CCTV backed up by facial recognition for handlers to go out and meet agents. What ever it became a SNAFU realy quickly,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-china-found-cia-spies-leak-2018-8?op=1&#038;r=US&#038;IR=T" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.businessinsider.com/how-china-found-cia-spies-leak-2018-8?op=1&#038;r=US&#038;IR=T</a></p>
<p>But there was a major bluebottle buzzing in the ointment&#8230; Apparently the CovComm app was supplied by people not exactly immersed in communications security at all levels and especially in Covert Comms where traffic analysis can have your hide nailed to a tree faster than you can squeek DE.</p>
<p>The US apparently blaim the Iranians for finding &#8220;it&#8221; and then the Iranians then &#8220;told&#8221; the Chinese (maybe through the Hermit Kingdom)&#8230; Apparently a number of CIA sources in China ended up with low velocity lead poisoning infront of their co-workers.</p>
<p>Then it started getting interesting because the Feebies got involved and things disappeared into the inter departmental long grass etc&#8230;</p>
<p>But apparently, and we don&#8217;t know who, through a cut out, told a journalist that it was an agency insider that had told somebody rather than the system being &#8220;found&#8221; (by simple traffic analysis etc).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cia-hunts-for-traitor-after-american-spies-are-executed-by-chinese-8qrkbs597" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cia-hunts-for-traitor-after-american-spies-are-executed-by-chinese-8qrkbs597</a></p>
<p>Which kind of threw not just tom the domestic cat into the ring but Robert the big wild Bobcat in, to munch on the body parts&#8230; Then it all went quiet again.</p>
<p>So&#8230; Did the CIA or other Agency have a &#8220;talkative talpidae problem&#8221; or not? Were they just incompetent or not? And quite a few other questions.</p>
<p>Well we know of atleast two CIA defectors,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/us/politics/cia-informants-killed-captured.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/us/politics/cia-informants-killed-captured.html</a></p>
<p>Or did someone just use a yagi around 2.5Ghz and sniff out the soon to be very unfortunate agents, after a face that stood out had been seen in the area?</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know and apparently the feebie enquiry was &#8220;on going&#8221; around the stems of the long grass&#8230;</p>
<p>And that is the way it&#8217;s still hanging.</p>

				<p>Wars&#8217; effects:</p>
<p>&#8212; In Afghanistan, war gave huge data to the Taliban on people they want to identify and their activities, making it easier to kill them, and the Taliban might share data with governments it wants as allies. Afghan institutions (unlike U.S. military and diplomatic) may not have had plans for rapid destruction or concealment of data before losing control.

<p>&#8212; War between Russia and Ukraine led to Nokia not taking away its connection between a surveillance system and a phone system in Russia, that being a surveillance system used by the FSB, Russia&#8217;s main security agency, even though Nokia &#8220;unequivocally&#8221; denounced the Russian invasion. One expert says that without Nokia&#8217;s help the connection could not have been made. The surveillance system, while within Russian law, violated European human rights law, according to a European court.

<p>re: <i>Hard to crack phone password.. </i></p>
<p>A report on Marcy Wheeler&#8217;s site about a phone seized by LEA on Jan 4, 2021 but only recently was the DoJ able to crack the &#8220;complex password&#8221;.</p>
<p>The phone was seized as part of an incident December 12, 2020, and belonged to Proud Boy leader Enrique Tarrio who is also an FBI informant.</p>
<p>From Jan 4, 2021 thru Dec 2021 LEAs could not crack the phone. About mid Jan 2022 the LEAs managed to get access to the phone and contents.</p>
<ul>
<li>[EW] [the delay was] presumably due to the physics involved in cracking a complex password and the due process of a privilege review [LEAs can only use what&#8217;s on the warrant and all other items are supposed to be omitted]</li>
</ul>
<p>So&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of complex password would keep LEAs from opening the phone?</li>
<li>Is it possible LEAs used a Quantum Cracking Program?</li>
<li>It is hard to imagine people from Dec37 having prime number generators in their phones but maybe someone else shoveled him a couple of OTP numbers?</li>

<p>There is a pattern.  I&#8217;ll bet some F12 Right Click came in handy.</p>

<blockquote><p>
While the NPCC and the tool&#8217;s developer, Pervade Software, initially insisted that Moore was mistaken because he had stumbled upon an early test build rather than the production version of Cyberalarm, The Register has done some digging and all is not as police and Pervade claimed.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
Please, uninstall #cyberalarm immediately. If you&#8217;ve reused #passwords, change them immediately as they&#8217;re currently stored in plain text and returned from an API without authentication.</p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s not a typo.

<p>It is pretty easy to get access to police networks. The security is just terrible. Just look through the audits. I&#8217;ve never seen anything worse than policing and registry audits, and they are consistently bad.</p>
<p>Admittedly in western Australia&#8217;s case it probably could of been a better system if they chose someone else than an undisclosed officer from the GRU to oversee it&#8217;s design and rollout, but hey, who better than someone who was repeatedly caught impersonating a police officer, before becoming one. At least the guy was keen.</p>
<p>Time is all it takes. Just pop boy Enrique Tarrio&#8217;s favorite slogans in the dictionary, and his social media history and you&#8217;ll probably get a hit.</p>

				<p>Trump’s latest response to Vladimir Putin’s ongoing assault was to apparently spitball ways the United States might provoke a different national security crisis, an idea he put forward during an 84-minute speech to Republican National Committee donors in New Orleans on Saturday.<br />

<p>Some unrelated secret sharing&#8230;</p>
<p>Unkenholz allegedly transmitted the secrets from his personal email address to the recipient’s private company email addresses. He is further accused of retaining the classified NDI within his personal email account.</p>
<p>The individual who received the data had previously held a Top Secret/SCI clearance from April 2016 until approximately June 2019 while employed at a company referred to in the indictment as Company 1.</p>
<p>However, the individual was working at a different company, referred to in the indictment as Company 2, from July 2019 until approximately January 2021. Consequently, the individual was not authorized to access, or receive, classified information during this time.</p>
<p>Neither Unkenholz’s personal email address nor the company email address to the individual who allegedly received the secret defense information was authorized storage locations for classified NDI.<br />

<p>Incompetence mainly, incompetence everywhere. Signals would constantly warn everyone about not associating with certain people (because those people were Russian spies). They would warn people about not handing documents to people. Not getting themselves compromised. They would warn the government about Russian operations, write up reports, no one took any notice.</p>
<p>Everything that is now obvious was all foreseen, put in reports, delivered to government, including all of Russia&#8217;s plans over the last 30 years, and it was all ignored or joked about. This in spite of people being locally abducted, murdered, and serious cases of -still to this day- ongoing espionage.</p>
<p>And really it is all a joke, the whole bloody show. All levels of government were infiltrated, everywhere, via simple incompetence.</p>

<p>If you want to keep a secret, don&#8217;t tell your government.<br />
They won&#8217;t take it seriously anyway, and it will be out the door within two weeks.</p>

<p>Here are the basic numbers in dollars&#8230;</p>
<p>Russia and China have spent more than $300 million interfering in democratic processes more than 100 times spanning 33 countries over the past decade. The frequency of these financial attacks has accelerated aggressively from two or three annually before 2014 to 15 to 30 in each year since 2016.<br />
<a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/covert-foreign-money/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/covert-foreign-money/</a></p>
<p>Fossil fuel lobby plays the same game, which is the direction the government&#8217;s eyes are usually looking and yet another direction their hands are reaching for.</p>
<p>&#8220;Total signed a deal with Lukoil, another Russian oil company, for exploring more than 1,000 square miles of western Siberian wilderness for shale oil&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To keep it that way, oil companies are publicly and privately pushing back against more sanctions by speaking out at shareholders’ meetings and by lobbying in Washington.&#8221;</p>
<p>The companies are making “a hedged bet that the Russian energy sector will escape sanctions and the Ukraine crisis will quiet down,”<br />

About what Trump said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“I knew Putin very well. He would not have done it. He would have never done it,” Trump said, without mentioning that, as president, he held up military aid for Ukraine as he pushed the country to investigate Biden’s son Hunter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Trump has always been in awe for established Kleptocrats as he aspires to become the world&#8217;s biggest Kleptocrat.</p>
