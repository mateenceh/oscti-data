				<p>@ Bruce, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>No details about what this prediction is based on. Makes sense, though.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would expect attacks to in effect be guided by two basic premises,</p>
<p>1, Where the value is.<br />
2, Which are the lowest hanging fruit as far as access is concerned.</p>
<p>One of the things I&#8217;ve continuously warned against is &#8220;XXX as a Service&#8221; systems be XXX fundamentally,</p>
<p>1, Communications<br />
2, Storage<br />
3, Processing</p>
<p>Whilst the second &#8220;storage&#8221; is fairly obvious and the third &#8220;processing&#8221; likewise, the first of &#8220;communications&#8221; is harder to see immediately.</p>
<p>To understand why sometimes you have to think &#8220;one or more steps removed&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a general rule there are two basic types of communications,</p>
<p>1, Routine<br />
2, Exceptional</p>
<p>Each communication has four basic asspects, qualative/quantative, temporal, geographical, organisational. Which break out to,</p>
<p>1, The message content<br />
2, The message size<br />
3, The time the message is sent<br />
4, The time the message is received<br />
5, Where the message originated<br />
6, Where the message terminated<br />
7, Who/what sent the message<br />
8, Who/what received the message</p>
<p>Some of these are &#8220;obvious&#8221; in all communications some are not. For instance the geo-location of a radio transmitter is often not that hard to estimate from it&#8217;s &#8220;ground wave bearings&#8221;. However unless very very close the location of a radio receiver is very difficult bordering on improbable[1].</p>
<p>Primarily &#8220;digital communications&#8221; is not by &#8220;radio broadcast&#8221; but by &#8220;point to point&#8221; circuit or packet switched &#8220;trunked&#8221; systems. Thus the originating and destination points with some care[2] can be estimated, but not strictly determined.</p>
<p>Similar can be said about the apparent geo-location and the Who/What.</p>
<p>All you realy know is the &#8220;time&#8221; you see the communication and it&#8217;s apparent size.</p>
<p>Even though these too can be faked in various ways, if they can be determined as &#8220;exceptional&#8221; rather than &#8220;routine&#8221; communications then the fact they have been sent, may actually be more important than the message contents communicated. This falls into the area of &#8220;traffic analysis&#8221;. Some networks such as encrypted padded &#8220;token rings&#8221; are way better at hiding such information than other types of network. Worst of all is probably packet switched CSMA systems on which ethernet was founded.</p>
<p>So whilst the SigInt agencies were at one time happy to hide out of sight on what to the users appeared the &#8220;edges&#8221; unseen, people are wising up to communications weaknesses and taking preventative steps (such as &#8220;networks on networks&#8221;).</p>
<p>So the SigInt agencies like the other crooks have to go where the value is but the users can not or can not easily see.</p>
<p>On modern data center systems it is very very rare for users even service administrators to actuall have &#8220;real access&#8221; at a level that enables them to determin if their activities or their data is being accessed by others&#8230;</p>
<p>So this makes the &#8220;hardware root&#8221; of such data center servers the new &#8220;hidden nodes&#8221; only this time in effect one or two steps closser to the user activities and data than monitoring just communications did.</p>
<p>There are a couple of other reasons you can throw in the pot for seasoning, but the above are tha main meat and veg of the meal, you become when you use XaaS or Cloud systems.</p>
<p>[1] Historicaly here are two basic ways to locate or &#8220;find&#8221; a radio receiver,</p>
<p>1.1, Capture/resonance of antenna.<br />
1.2, Detection of local oscillator.</p>
<p>As you get very close you can &#8220;fix&#8221; it&#8217;s position by several other means such as being able to see it, hear it, sense it&#8217;s radiated heat or energy drain paterns. Which ever is used once a &#8220;fix&#8221; is obtained it is a matter of going in for the &#8220;Finish&#8221; what ever that might be (hence &#8220;Find, Fix, Finish&#8221;).</p>
<p>[2] One of the problems with all trunked systems is that they are &#8220;networks&#8221;. This implies &#8220;edges and nodes&#8221; which can be very problematical. Whilst you can see traffic going into and comming out of an edge, it&#8217;s wise not to fall into two mistakes,</p>
<p>2.1 Assume an edge has no unseen node<br />
2.2 Assume a node does not duplicate or redirect a packet or circuit.</p>
<p>This means that unless you monitor all nodes and all their connecting edges you can not say where traffic originated from or the real termination point. Think about this in terms of an inteligent &#8220;Vampire Tap&#8221;.</p>

				<p>It’s interesting that the advisory urges MSP customers to make sure certain safeguards are in their contracts.</p>
<p>Some of these include MSP monitoring and logging, enforcing MFA, running incident response and recovery plans, and so on.</p>
<p>I wonder if a customer would use an auditor to verify these controls. I’m also curious whose security posture is typically more up to snuff &#8211; the customer’s or the MSP’s?</p>
<p>What would common MSPs be?</p>

				<p>@ Ted, ALL,</p>
<blockquote><p>I wonder if a customer would use an auditor to verify these controls. I’m also curious whose security posture is typically more up to snuff – the customer’s or the MSP’s?</p></blockquote>
<p>Those are almost irrelevant questions.</p>
<p>The first question is about who has the power in the relationship&#8230; In England we have a question,</p>
<p>&#8220;Which end of the 5h1ty stick are you? Because liquid 5h1t flows down hill&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if you are the CIA or other part of the US Government, if they are &#8220;the customer&#8221; then they will not have the power. The service provider will either not offer liability above a minimum, and they will also probably have contractual clauses that requires &#8220;the customer&#8221; to take on risk, either directly or to externalise it through insurance etc.</p>
<p>Even when the Government is putting to contract, they will get considerably less than they pay for. The prime contractor will take 50% of the top, and take maybe 1% of the risk and sub contract the rest of it out. In turn the sub-contractors will take a big slice of the money and sub-contract out the risk. This is standard practice, and provided there are sufficient sub-contractors, eventually the work will end up with some assetless organisation run by two geeks and a dog, with an insurance policy that does not actually cover what they think it does so if anything goes wrong there is no payout any way.</p>
<p>But it can get worse a lot lot worse. Look up Lloyds of London and the &#8220;LMX Spiral&#8221;. Put simply there were way to few underwriters prepared to take risk, so they used the re-insurance market. The result was they sold the risk round snd around amongst a tiny number of &#8220;new name&#8221; syndicates. So when it went wrong there was not any diversification of coverage just a huge spiral of legal contracts with each one being fought every which way in court that went on for years[1].</p>
<p>But&#8230; as a judge in a civil case made fairly clear there is a principle of English law,</p>
<p>&#8220;That one cannot conclude a valid contract with oneself.&#8221;</p>
<p>So there was a very distinct probability that the whole reinsurance system at Lloyd&#8217;s where risk had been deliberatly and knowingly sold around was probably legally flawed if not outright fraud.</p>
<p>As I understand it there is no similar principle in the US preventing such &#8220;spirals&#8221; being &#8220;engineered&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>But obviously such companies involved with such spirals would not want such information getting out. Therefore it is likely that,</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if a customer would use an auditor to verify these controls.&#8221;</p>
<p>Would be robustly re-buffed in some manner.</p>
<p>As for who&#8217;s security posture would be better, I doubt very much that any MSP would be even remotely close to &#8220;top draw&#8221; as their basic business model would preclude it.</p>
<p>But then similar considerations would apply to the contract issuer or customer of such MSPs, so I doubt they would be upto much either.</p>
<p>To see why consider the following,</p>
<p>1, We know there are more undiscovered instances of vulnerabilities than we currently know how to fix.<br />
2, The MSP base model is about &#8220;access&#8221;.<br />
3, If you can get access from outside from a public network then so can anyone else.<br />
4, Many vulnerabilities alow bypassing of authentication mechanisms.</p>
<p>Therefore the likes of MFA are a bit pointless when a vulnerability simply walks an unauthorised attacker around it.</p>
<p>If you value your data or the information about What/When/Who was accessed then you need to ensure &#8220;No External Access&#8221; at any time in any way, from either public or even private external networks.</p>
<p>So the MSP model is deficient and more likely to fail than not.</p>
<p>[1] The few &#8220;new-names&#8221; involved had every single asset that could be taken from them taken&#8230; Some killed themselves others became bankrupt, the most Evil Woman alive &#8220;Mary Weeden&#8221; the Wife of then Tory Party Chairman author Lord Archer[2] it was she that was responsible for those duped new-names. I was very nearly one of those names, but I got suspicious when they would not open up on the underwriting book about &#8220;asbestos debt&#8221; a Lloyds underwriter I had been in the military with warned me about. On asking I felt a couple of people were behaving oddly, effectively furtively so chose instead not to sign on the dotted line, about a year beforehand&#8230;</p>
<p>[2] Lord archer, son of a fraudster, and life long &#8220;con artist&#8221; at bet. Some in UK Politics saw through him, and gave warnings but others ignored them. The marriage like that of many Tory Party Wives was almost certainly not for love but status and power,</p>

<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, if I was a MSP customer, I would want to audit a MSP’s security claims. To your points, though, you’d want to thoroughly map out your legal and financial risks.</p>
<p>Did you see Bruce’s post that mentioned Kaseya? As you recall, Kaseya was a MSP who was attacked by REvil. That attack enabled attacks on 1,500 of Kaseya’s customers. According to Bruce:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Employees warned Kaseya’s management for years about critical security flaws, but they were ignored.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven’t read very thoroughly on that event. So I don’t know if an audit, or a deeper discussion, would have impeded down stream attacks. I’d like to have an insider’s peek at lessons learned.</p>

				<p>@Ted, @Clive, @ALL</p>
<p>re: <i>Hire an Experto </i></p>
<p>There are a lot of variations on what constitutes and &#8220;audit&#8221; and in the proposed situation it boils down to &#8220;hire an expert to verify&#8221;.</p>
<p>While this is a circular roundabout arrangement it presumes that there is someone who does have the ability to verify AND that those someones are available to do the work AND that the fees for doing so are within the budget.</p>
<p>If you are on the top of the pyramid financially. and as Clive pointed out have control of the processes rather than being just shown a closet full of blinking LEDs with tour guide muttering &#8220;security infrastructure&#8221;, you might be able to hire some big guns in the field to do the once overs.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the pyramid, lies the targeted companies who are going to get ripped once the security blockade is breached.  These folks may have some funds but often they don&#8217;t have funds to allocate to a deep inspection and have to rely on what folks at the top of pile have done, or rather, if the top dog is still doing business and there are other dogs in the kennel in that environment, then they figure it&#8217;s safe to presume that the kibble-ration is AOK enough to follow-on the leash.</p>
<p>As pretty much every topic, every week here, is chock a block with what The Experts Found or Didn&#8217;t Find on retrospect, the average schmoe doesn&#8217;t stand a chance at discovering anything in time to stick a finger in the dike.</p>
<p>You can talk to Elon Musk about how this is working for him&#8230;</p>
<p>You can also look up &#8220;Autonomy Corporation § Hewlett-Packard&#8221; to see how well that audit went.</p>
<p>Due Diligence is fine and recommended. Relying on an Audit to save your Company isn&#8217;t.  Relying on a Audit in a Technically Difficult Field isn&#8217;t going to provide any enlightenment in the near term for a minimal investment.</p>

				<p>@ Ted,</p>
<p>Re : Bruce&#8217;s comment of,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Employees warned Kaseya’s management for years about critical security flaws, but they were ignored.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>It kind of makes my point of,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Would be robustly re-buffed in some manner.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Few not in the game, realise thus sub-contracting is about two things,</p>
<p>1, Avoiding all liability.<br />
2, Making as much money for as little work as possible.</p>
<p>So as I said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The prime contractor will take 50% off of the top, and take maybe 1% of the risk and sub contract the rest of it out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It was this mentality in managment, by Booze Allen Hamilton, that alowed Ed Snowden to do what he did. And guess what a consulting industry thought was the primary concern at the time,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.commcoreconsulting.com/booz-allen-edward-snowden-what-did-they-know-when-did-they-know-it/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.commcoreconsulting.com/booz-allen-edward-snowden-what-did-they-know-when-did-they-know-it/</a></p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;We think Snowden type events should be wake-up calls for any organization to make sure that you have a crisis plan&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Yup did BAH &#8220;have a crisis plan&#8221;.</p>
<p>Let me tell you about &#8220;Crisis Plans&#8221; they are &#8220;reactive&#8221; not &#8220;proactive&#8221; not just in action but actual planning as well.</p>
<p>The reason is as I&#8217;ve said before, when it comes to attack &#8220;instances&#8221; and the &#8220;classes&#8221; they fall into,</p>
<p>&#8220;There are &#8216;Known Knowns&#8217;, &#8216;Unknown Knowns&#8217;, and &#8216;Unknown Unknowns'&#8221;</p>
<p>Whilst you can plan for &#8216;Known instances in Known Classes&#8217; of attack, and sometimes &#8216;Unknown Instances in Known Classes&#8217; of attack, you can not plan for &#8216;Unknown Classes&#8217; of attack and all to frequently &#8216;Unknown Instances in Known Classes&#8221; of attack.</p>
<p>And to be honest any &#8220;Crisis Plan&#8221; written just around &#8216;Known Instances&#8217; is going to be too large and unwieldy to prepare or use.</p>
<p>The usual analogy I use is &#8220;evacuation plans&#8221;&#8230; Imagine you have a team, they brainstorm up a hundred or so instances of emergancy events ranging from &#8220;fire&#8221; to &#8220;meteor strike&#8221; and they write an individual &#8220;evacuation plan&#8221; for each&#8230; of what use would they be?</p>
<p>The obvious and correct answer is none to not a lot. What you actually do is look at the individual instances and group them by commanality into clases. You then try to find ways to pull classes together into super-set classes by altering your responses so you have increased commonality. Hopefully you get the hundreds of instances down to just one or two evacuation plans that people can learn.</p>
<p>The problem is that whilst &#8220;evacuation plan&#8221; instances usually have a very great deal in common so are amenable to collection into classes that can then have common responses, because of the very limited nature of instance types, the same is not true when &#8220;Human Agency&#8221; is involved.</p>
<p>Human agency &#8220;plans around plans&#8221; as a basic criteria of success&#8230;</p>
<p>Thus you end up with two basic Crisis Plans,</p>
<p>1, For &#8220;acts&#8221; by nature / god&#8221;<br />
2, For &#8220;Human agency&#8221; by insiders</p>
<p>With a third overlaping in the middle for events by the likes of terrorists and criminals,</p>
<p>3, For &#8220;Human agency&#8221; by outsiders</p>
<p>All have a basic preset set of banal Public Relations comments and a list of people to call into &#8220;Crisis Managment Teams&#8221; with the typical Who / Where / When and with What lists. Because the reality is there is little else you can do, especially if the event has &#8220;human agency&#8221; behind it.</p>
<p>OK people will try to &#8220;slap lipstick on the pig&#8221; but at the end of the day that is just to justify the long meetings and nice ring binders&#8230;</p>
<p>Do I sound cynical, probably but I&#8217;ve been through to many &#8220;crissis planning&#8221; sessions to be anything but&#8230;</p>
<p>The reality of Ed Snowden is,</p>
<p>1, People are needed to perform tasks.<br />
2, People can not be trusted.</p>
<p>And the lesson from that is exactly the same as it was before&#8230;</p>
<p>As I said back near on a decade ago,</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not a murderer, untill you are&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same with trust,</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not untrustworthy, untill you are&#8221;.</p>
<p>The When and the Why of somebody flipping / switching for the first time from trusted to untrustworthy is not actually known, even though some talk of &#8220;MICE&#8221; there are others, and most are not very pre-meditated, hence them getting caught.</p>

<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, true. If your company was choosing a MSP to work with, it probably wouldn’t hurt to ask if they participate in any assessment programs.</p>
<p>I see CCCS[1] has guidance for consumers of managed services. In it they list various assessment standards and frameworks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>ISO270001/2
</li>
<li>ISACA &#8211; COBIT
</li>
<li>NIST &#8211; Risk Management Framework</li>
</ul>
<p>Not that these would take the place of contract language. However, if a rigorous audit of the contract was infeasible maybe these could further support risk mitigation.</p>

<p>re: <i>probably wouldn’t hurt to ask if they participate in any assessment programs</i></p>
<p>Due diligence is always a good idea but as far as the scope of the topic consider</p>
<p>1) The company states in their brochures that they participate in N-Programs</p>
<p>2) The company states in face to face meetings they participate in N-Programs</p>
<p>3) You ask to see their certificates of completion or whatever these N-Program supply in way of documentation and you get shown some papers that say that.</p>
<p>4) You even dig deep and hire a Hot-Up-and-Comer-Ted to do the review Ted  reviews the program specs and the documentation and maybe even gets a peek at some sample code which looks very clean.</p>
<p>Is any of the above going to really help you?  There is no way in 1-10days or 30-150 days that you can audit for 50+% compliance on all aspects of all those specifications.  Nor can you guarantee that once you &#8220;move along&#8221; to the next section that the one you just completed didn&#8217;t change for the worse.</p>
<p>This is the round robin of audit and compliance.  Even deep pockets like HP got a botched audit although there were enough sirens blaring that you could hear the warning all over Silicon Valley only to be ignored by the CEO of HP at the time because they wanted something  for their own internal reasons and the public reasons and the public warnings were tossed away in the drive to Get The Deal.  It&#8217;s not the first nor the last time this will happen and it didn&#8217;t hurt the CEO career much, last I read they were doing very well all the same.</p>
<p>One of the issues is that people &#8220;think&#8221; an &#8220;audit&#8221; means &#8220;something&#8221; it doesn&#8217;t and there is no way an audit can do what they think it does.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like looking a barn wall. It is painted red?.  Is it painted red on the other side of the wall? There is no way directly way to know unless you go look, so you walk around and sure enough that wall is painted red. Are you done? No.  Because you walked away from the first side, you no longer know if that side remained painted red of if someone smeared a big graffiti tag right in the middle of it.</p>
<p>Of course that is a trivial example, but to get a better sense of limitations is to read a some Annual Reports and concentrate on the CPA&#8217;s Scope and Limitations statement. Every CPA and CPA firm in the USA has a boiler plate for the 3 or so different types of audits they perform.</p>
<p>Once you really understand what it says and what it doesn&#8217;t, you will have achieved a level of clarity about Annual &amp; Quarterly Statements as provided to the SEC.  A lot of gloss &#8211; on the paper.</p>
