Cybercriminals take advantage of the essential role that domain names play on the internet by registering names that appear related to existing domains or brands, with the intent of profiting from user mistakes. This is known as cybersquatting. The purpose of squatting domains is to confuse users into believing that the targeted brands (such as Netflix) own these domain names (such as netflix-payments[.]com) or to profit from users\u2019 typing mistakes (such as whatsalpp[.]com for WhatsApp). While cybersquatting is not always malicious toward users, it is illegal in the U.S.,[1] and squatting domains are often used or repurposed for attacks.\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto Networks squatting detector system discovered that 13,857 squatting domains were registered in December 2019, an average of 450 per day. We found that 2,595 (18.59%) squatted domain names are malicious, often distributing malware or conducting phishing attacks, and 5,104 (36.57%) squatting domains we studied present a high risk to users visiting them, meaning they have evidence of association with malicious URLs within the domain or are utilizing bulletproof hosting.\r\n\r\nWe also ranked the Top 20 most abused domains in December 2019 based on adjusted malicious rate, which means that a domain is either a target of many squatting domains or most of these squatting domains are confirmed malicious. We found that domain squatters prefer profitable targets, such as mainstream search engines and social media, financial, shopping and banking websites. When visiting these sites, users are often prepared to share sensitive information, which opens them up to phishing and scams to steal sensitive credentials or money if they can be deceived into visiting a squatting domain instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom December 2019 to date, we observed a variety of malicious domains with different objectives:\r\n\r\n \tPhishing: A domain mimicking Wells Fargo (secure-wellsfargo[.]org) targeting customers to steal sensitive information, including email credentials and ATM PINs. Also, a domain mimicking Amazon (amazon-india[.]online) set up to steal user credentials, specifically targeting mobile users in India.\r\n \tMalware distribution: A domain mimicking Samsung (samsungeblyaiphone[.]com) hosting Azorult malware to steal credit card information.\r\n \tCommand and control (C2): Domains mimicking Microsoft (microsoft-store-drm-server[.]com and microsoft-sback-server[.]com) attempting to conduct C2 attacks to compromise an entire network.\r\n \tRe-bill scam: Several phishing sites mimicking Netflix (such as netflixbrazilcovid[.]com) set up to steal victims\u2019 money by first offering a small initial payment for a subscription to a product like weight loss pills. However, if users don\u2019t cancel the subscription after the promotion period, a much higher cost will be charged to their credit cards, usually $50-100.\r\n \tPotentially unwanted program (PUP): Domains mimicking Walmart (walrmart44[.]com) and Samsung (samsungpr0mo[.]online) distributing PUP, such as spyware, adware or a browser extension. They usually perform unwanted changes, like changing the browser's default page or hijacking the browser to insert ads. Of note, the Samsung domain looks like a legitimate Australia educational news website.\r\n \tTechnical support scam: Domains mimicking Microsoft (such as microsoft-alert[.]club) trying to scare users into paying for fake customer support.\r\n \tReward scam: A domain mimicking Facebook (facebookwinners2020[.]com) scamming users with rewards, such as free products or money. To claim the prize, users need to fill out a form with their personal information such as date of birth, phone number, occupation and income.\r\n \tDomain parking: A domain mimicking RBC Royal Bank (rbyroyalbank[.]com) leveraging a popular parking service, ParkingCrew, to generate profit based on how many users land on the site and click the advertisements.\r\n\r\nWe studied domain squatting techniques including typosquatting, combosquatting, level-squatting, bitsquatting and homograph-squatting (all defined below). Malicious actors can use these techniques to distribute malware or to conduct scams and phishing campaigns.\r\n\r\nTo detect squatting domains, Palo Alto Networks developed an automated system to capture emerging campaigns from newly registered domains, as well as from passive DNS (pDNS) data. We continue to detect currently active cybersquatting domains \u2013 we identify malicious and suspicious squatting domains and designate them to the appropriate categories (such as phishing, malware, C2 or grayware). Protections against domains classified in these categories are available in multiple Palo Alto Networks security subscriptions, including URL Filtering and DNS Security.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that enterprises block and closely monitor traffic from these domains, while consumers should make sure that they type domain names correctly and double-check that the domain owners are trusted before entering any site. More tips can be found in this post on how to protect against cyberattacks.\r\nSquatting Techniques\r\nTyposquatting is one of the most common types of domain registration abuse. Typosquatters intentionally register misspelled variants (such as whatsalpp[.]com) of target domain names (whatsapp[.]com) to profit from users\u2019 typing mistakes or to deceive users into believing that they are visiting the correct target domain. The most frequent typosquatting techniques include registering names one edit distance from the original domain, as these are the most common and overlooked mistakes users make. For more information, readers can refer to academic research papers on the scale and malicious use of typosquatting.\r\n\r\nCombosquatting is another widespread registration abuse that combines popular trademarks with words such as \u201csecurity,\u201d \u201cpayment\u201d or \u201cverification.\u201d Combosquatting domains like netflix-payments[.]com are often used in phishing emails, by scam websites and for social engineering attacks to convince users that they are visiting web content maintained by the targeted trademark. For more information, readers can refer to this academic paper on a longitudinal study of combosquatting.\r\n\r\nHomographsquatting domains take advantage of internationalized domain names (IDNs), where Unicode characters are allowed (such as microsof\u0167[.]com). Attackers usually replace one or more characters in the target domain with visually similar characters from another language. These domains can be perfectly indistinguishable from their targets, as in the case of apple.com, where the English letter \"a\" (U+0061) was replaced with the Cyrillic letter \"\u0430\" (U+0430). For more information, readers can refer to academic research papers on IDNs.\r\n\r\nSoundsquatting domains take advantage of homophones, i.e., words that sound alike (for example, weather and whether). Attackers can register homophone variants of popular domains, such as 4ever21[.]com for forever21[.]com. As text-to-speech software like Siri and Google Assistant becomes prevalent, more and more users will become vulnerable to the abuse of soundsquatting domains. For more information, readers can refer to this academic research paper on soundsquatting.\r\n\r\nBitsquatting domains have a character that differs in one bit (such as micposoft[.]com) from the same character as the targeted legitimate domain (microsoft[.]com). Bitsquatting can benefit attackers because a hardware error can cause a random bit-flip in memory where domain names are stored temporarily. Thus, even though users type the correct domains, they may still be led to malicious ones. Although such hardware errors are usually rare, an academic research paper has shown that bitsquatting is a real threat.\r\n\r\nLevelsquatting domains, such as the case of safety.microsoft.com.mdmfmztwjj.l6kan7uf04p102xmpq[.]bid, include the targeted brand\u2019s domain name as a subdomain. In this example, the victims of the phishing attack might believe they are visiting safety.microsoft.com, when instead, they are visiting the attacker\u2019s website. This attack is especially worrisome for mobile users because the browser's address bar might not be wide enough to display the entire domain name. For more information, readers can refer to this academic paper for a more comprehensive study of levelsquatting domains.\r\nDetection of Various Squatting Techniques\r\nWe leverage lexical analysis to detect candidate squatting domains among the Palo Alto Networks newly registered domain (NRD) and pDNS feeds. Our list of target domains is the combination of popular domains in general and domains popular in specific categories, such as shopping and business. We generate the aforementioned squatting variants of the target domains, and match them against our NRD feed and pDNS hostnames. Additionally, we cluster weekly collections of NRDs to see if registration campaigns target known brands. After the initial discovery step, we leverage WHOIS data to filter out defensive registrations and a heuristic rule-based classifier to identify which domains are true squatting domains.\r\n\r\nFigure 1 shows the daily detection statistics for December 2019. During this period, we detected 13,857 squatting domains (~450 per day). Since then, the number of daily detections fluctuate from 200-900. To understand how these domains are leveraged for abuse, we use URL Filtering to categorize them. We label domain names as malicious if they are involved in distributing malware or phishing, or if they are being used for command and control (C2) communication. We label domains categorized as grayware, parked, questionable, insufficient content and high-risk as suspicious. The average malicious rate of the 13,857 squatting domains is 18.59% (2,595) and the average suspicious rate is 36.57% (5,104).\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108520\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 1. Volume and malicious and suspicious rates of daily domain squatting in December 2019.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nNext, we compare our detection of squatting domains to vendors found on VirusTotal. Considering detection delays, we allow a 10-day time window for malicious squatting domains to appear on VirusTotal. Figure 2 shows how well the top 10 vendors detected these malicious and high-risk domains. The best-performing vendor covers about 25% of the malicious or high-risk squatting domains that we detected. Meanwhile, other vendors cover less than 20% of our detections. Lastly, we found that 55% of malicious or high-risk squatting domains are not detected by any vendors.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108522\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 2. Malicious and high-risk squatting domain detection on VirusTotal in December 2019.[\/caption]\r\nThe Domain Squatting Ecosystem\r\nTo identify malicious infrastructure hotspots, we studied specific network elements and entities that typosquatters depend on for their operations. Specifically, we studied popular registrars, name services, autonomous systems and certificate authorities used by domain squatters.\r\n\r\nFor each chart outlined below, we considered the number of squatting detections to reflect their popularity among domain squatters, and the malicious IOC rate to quantify the degree of threat to users. Combining these two metrics, we calculated the adjusted malicious rate of each entity. Thus, a high adjusted malicious rate means that an entity is either targeted by many squatting domains or most of these squatting domains are malicious.\r\nTop 20 Most Abused Domains\r\nDomain squatters prefer popular and thus profitable targets. Figure 3 shows the Top 20 most abused domains. These targets are popular websites, such as mainstream search engines and social media, financial, shopping and banking websites. Squatting domains mimicking these websites benefit from their credibility to attract more users that can be scammed. Therefore, these targets have relatively high squatting detection numbers.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108524\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 3. Top 20 most abused domains in December 2019.[\/caption]\r\nTop 10 Most Abused DNS Services and Autonomous Systems\r\nNext, we look at the DNS services and the autonomous systems (AS) used by squatting domains to understand their infrastructure preferences. An AS is a set of IP subnets maintained by one or more network operators.\r\n\r\nThe name service used by domain squatters often signifies which registrar was used to register the domain, where the squatting web page is hosted or which parking service these domains utilize to profit from user traffic. Figure 4 displays the most abused name services of squatting domains. Freenom.com and dnspod.com are often used by domain squatters, as they provide cheap or free domain registration and domain hosting. DNSPod is known for hosting shady DNS records and for providing services for malicious bulletproof hosting operators. Level-squatters might choose to use registrar.eu as it supports an unlimited number of subdomains and free URL forwarding, which reduces the cost of deploying and scaling attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108528\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 4. Top 10 most abused DNS services in December 2019.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, parkingcrew.net and above.com are popular parking services because they provide a simple monetization avenue to domain owners, achieved by pointing domain names\u2019 DNS records to their name servers. Parking services usually show users parked pages laden with ads or redirect users to affiliate marketing or malicious websites.\r\n\r\nAs hosting services often have their own AS, we observed that the AS distribution is somewhat consistent with the name service distribution. The top three most abused AS (19495, 48635, 262254) belong to the three most abused name service providers, respectively (freenom.com, registrar.eu, ddos-guard.net). The fourth most abused AS (40034) is owned by ztomy.com, a service favored for DNS hijacking attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108532\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 5. Top 10 most abused autonomous systems in December 2019.[\/caption]\r\nTop 10 Most Abused Registrars\r\nRegistrars are entities that sell domain names to users. The most abused registrar, Internet.bs, provides free services preferred by domain squatters, including privacy-protected registration and URL forwarding. We captured several level-squatting campaigns at this registrar. In these campaigns, attackers set up hundreds of subdomains mimicking popular target domains under com-secure-login[.]info and com-finder-me[.]info. An example level-squatting subdomain is www.icloud.com-secure-login[.]info. The second-most abused registrar, Openprovider, offers cheap and easy bulk registrations, attracting many squatting registrations. Additionally, we observed many domains from this registrar having their WHOIS records redacted for privacy. Our system discovered many level-squatting domains registered at TLD Registrar Solutions using the .support TLD (top-level domain), including icloud.com-iphone[.]support and apple.com.recover[.]support, which users might confuse with legitimate Apple technical support services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108536\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 6. Top 10 most abused registrars in December 2019.[\/caption]\r\nTop 5 Most Abused Certificate Authorities\r\nAs HTTPS became common, cybercriminals increased the use of certificates to make their websites appear legitimate. Figure 7 provides an overview of the certificate authorities (CAs) preferred by squatting sites. The most popular CA is Cloudflare, as it offers a bundle, including free SSL encryption. The second most popular CA, cPanel Inc CA, is preferred by domain squatters because of the convenience and the ease of its AutoSSL services. Through cPanel\u2019s management interface, their customers are able to finish all steps of SSL encryption, including certificate purchase, automatic installation and renewal. Thawte CA is not a trusted CA anymore, and browsers will label their certificate as suspicious, but squatting domains are still using it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108540\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 7. Top 5 most abused certificate authorities in December 2019.[\/caption]\r\nMalicious Usages and Threats\r\nIn this section, we discuss in detail different types of abuse leveraging squatting domains. It includes malware distribution, phishing, C2 communication, potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), scams, ad-laden sites and affiliate marketing.\r\nPhishing\r\nPhishing is one of the most popular threats leveraging squatting domains. All of the different squatting techniques we discussed can be used to lure users into believing that a squatting domain is owned by the legitimate brand and to increase the efficiency of phishing and scam campaigns.\r\n\r\nOne example is a combosquatting domain, secure-wellsfargo[.]org, which targets Wells Fargo\u2019s customers. This domain hosts a copy of Wells Fargo\u2019s official site, as illustrated in Figure 8.a. However, this site is only the front-end portion of the original site, redirecting all clicks to the same login page (shown in Figure 8.b) to steal customers\u2019 sensitive information, including email credentials and ATM PINs.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108542\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 8.a. Fake Wells Fargo website: secure-wellsfargo[.]org[\/caption][caption id=\"attachment_108544\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 8.b. Phishing login page for secure-wellsfargo[.]org[\/caption]Figure 9 demonstrates how another combosquatting domain, amazon-india[.]online, mimicking Amazon, is set up to steal user credentials, specifically targeting mobile users in India. As a common strategy, all links on this site first redirect users to the same product page (the middle screenshot in Figure 9) and then to the payment page. In this particular case, the perpetrators did not even go through the trouble of optimizing the phishing page for desktop users.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108584\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 9. Fake Amazon website: amazon-india[.]online[\/caption]\r\nMalware Distribution\r\nSquatting domains are also often used to distribute malware. A combosquatting domain mimicking Samsung (samsungeblyaiphone[.]com) hosts Azorult malware 5acd6d9ac235104f90f9a39c11807c37cdfb103d6c151cc1a2e4e38bf3dbe41f on the URL samsungeblyaiphone[.]com\/dolce.exe. Azorult malware is a credential and payment card information stealer, usually spread by phishing emails. It has been an active threat since 2016 and is one of the top malware families. Once the malware executes, it will generate a unique identifier for the compromised machine based on the machine\u2019s globally unique identifier and username. Then the malware will contact the C2 server with this identifier, and it will retrieve the configuration of the infected machine, including the running processes and services. Additionally, Azorult malware often downloads payload from other compromised servers. The new payload can collect and send out sensitive data such as cookies, browser credentials and cryptocurrency information.\r\n\r\nAnalyzing the malware sample downloaded from samsungeblyaiphone[.]com, we found that it attempted to send a POST request to samsungeblyaiphone[.]com\/index.php, which is consistent with this malware family\u2019s known behavior to exfiltrate data. Besides the observed network activity, the malware also displayed suspicious behaviors such as changing the settings of Internet Explorer.\r\nCommand &amp; Control (C2)\r\nMalware instances on infected machines typically need to \u201cphone home\u201d to a C2 server for further commands to execute, to download new payloads or to perform data exfiltration. Malware often relies on domain names to locate C2 servers, and these domains are called C2 domains. While using squatting domains for C2 is uncommon, we speculate that the intention of those who do so is to evade automated detection (such as Domain Generation Algorithm detection) and manual analysis.\r\n\r\nOur squatting detection system captured squatting domains mimicking Microsoft, microsoft-store-drm-server[.]com on January 30, 2020, and microsoft-sback-server[.]com on February 3, 2020. From the Palo Alto Networks WildFire Malware Analysis Engine, we retrieved similar malware samples, including fa28b59eb0ccd21d3994b0778946679497399b72c2e256ebf2434553cb7bf373 and e7fb436bf7d8784da092315bce1d3511a6055da41fe67362bad7a4c5d3f0294e , connecting to them. These two domain names used the previously mentioned DNSPod for name resolution, which is infamous for being slow in responding to abuse investigations. First, the malware resolved these domains to the same IP address 217.182.227[.]117. Then, it communicated through SSL traffic with the same JA3 (SSL fingerprint): 6312930a139fa3ed22b87abb75c16afa on client-side and 4192c0a946c5bd9b544b4656d9f624a4 on server-side. Observing the same behavior, we conclude they were using the identical SSL application and were part of the same campaign.\r\n\r\nSimilar to most C2 domains, these two squatting domains were short-lived. They were only used for one to two days after registration and were then abandoned by attackers. Tracking 217.182.227[.]117, we are able to find other C2 domains used by this campaign: store-in-box[.]com from Jan. 27-28, stt-box[.]com from Jan. 29-31, microsoft-store-drm-server[.]com from Jan. 31-Feb. 2, and microsoft-sback-server[.]com on February 3.\r\nPotentially Unwanted Program (PUP)\r\nA PUP could be either standalone software, like spyware or adware, or a browser extension. PUPs usually perform unwanted changes, like changing the browser's default page or hijacking the browser to insert ads. Researchers have shown that some PUP downloaders are also repurposed for malware campaigns. Websites hosting PUPs usually try to scare users by showing them warning messages like \u201cYour computer is infected!\u201d or \u201cYour license has expired!\u201d to convince them to download the advertised software.\r\n\r\nFigure 10 shows a combosquatting domain mimicking Walmart (walrmart44[.]com) that distributes PUP. Depending on the browser used, it redirects users to landing pages offering different types of PUPs for download. When we visit this domain in Safari, it tells us that our Flash player might be outdated and offers us the chance to download the newest version from their site, as illustrated in Figure 10.a. While using Chrome, we get a \u201cclick continue and install extension\u201d page, as shown in Figure 10.b, which redirects users to the Chrome store for the \u201cSecurity for Chrome\u201d extension. Alternatively, this website will occasionally redirect users to various legitimate ecommerce websites, including Walmart, Amazon and Aliexpress. After repeated visits, it will remember the source IP address and reject further visits even if we use different browsers (Figure 10.c).\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108552\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 10.a.

However, visiting this site, users are faced with popup windows, warning them about security flaws (Figure 11.a). Clicking on the warnings, users are redirected to a fake virus scanning page, which recognizes their operating system to increase credibility but will always display the same list of detected viruses (Figure 11.b). Finally, clicking the \u201cProceed\u201d button takes users to a download page for a system repair tool, which is legitimate but potentially unwanted.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108558\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 11.a. samsungpr0mo[.]online displaying warning messages in the top right corner.[\/caption][caption id=\"attachment_108560\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 11.b. A fake virus scanning page displays after clicking on a warning message from samsungpr0mo[.]online[\/caption]\r\nTechnical Support Scam\r\nTechnical support scams are social engineering attacks. An associated website\u2019s purpose is to scare people with audio and visual warnings into believing that their machine is compromised. It prompts people to call the displayed fake technical support center\u2019s phone number. When people call the number, scammers will try to persuade them that the only way to save their machine is by paying for the fraudulent support service. In the case of combosquatting, the domain name often contains keywords like \u201csecurity,\u201d \u201calert\u201d and \u201cwarning.\u201d An example domain mimicking Microsoft (microsoft-alert[.]club) shown in Figure 12.a was registered on June 11, 2020. This website presents warning messages in Japanese (translated to English in Figure 12.b), renders dynamic content, such as a running command line window, and plays audio alerts.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108562\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 12.a. A technical support scam page hosted on microsoft-alert[.]club[\/caption][caption id=\"attachment_108564\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 12.b. Translated to English.[\/caption]\r\nRe-bill Scam\r\nRe-bill scammers first offer a subscription to products such as weight loss pills in exchange for a small initial payment. However, if users don\u2019t cancel the subscription after the promotion period, a much higher cost will be charged to their credit cards, usually $50-100. Additional information on this type of scam can be found in Unit 42\u2019s previous research on deceptive affiliate marketing. The combosquatting domain netflixbrazilcovid[.]com leverages both Netflix and the COVID-19 pandemic. The main page looks like the Portuguese Netflix site (Figure 13.a), and has the purpose of obtaining user email addresses. (It is shown translated to English in Figure 13.b.) A deceptive reward message (Figure 13.c) is then shown to potential victims. Finally, users are redirected to a survey and then to a re-bill scam page (Figure 13.d).\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108566\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 13.a.

When we initially captured facebookwinners2020[.]com, it was under development with placeholder images and texts, as shown in Figure 14.a. However, the perpetrators recently replaced placeholders with meaningful content. From the screenshot, we could tell the page mimics a free lottery related to Facebook. To claim the prize, users need to fill out a form with their personal information such as date of birth, phone number, occupation and income (Figure 14.b).\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108574\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 14.a. Reward scam page under development: facebookwinners2020[.]com[\/caption][caption id=\"attachment_108576\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 14.b. An application form on facebookwinners2020[.]com requesting personal information.[\/caption]\r\nDomain Parking\r\nA common and easy way to monetize user traffic is to use a parking service by pointing the squatting domain\u2019s IP address or NS record to the parking service\u2019s servers. Figure 15 provides an example of a parked domain mimicking RBC Royal Bank, rbyroyalbank[.]com, leveraging a popular parking service, ParkingCrew, to generate profit based on how many users land on the site and click the advertisements. In some cases, parking services also redirect users to scam and phishing pages. As the hostname in the certificate is different from the squatting domain, the browser will label it as \u201cNot secure.\u201d Parked pages usually show users a list of advertisements related to the parked domain. In our example, the ads shown are related to financial services.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108578\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 15. A parked page for rbyroyalbank[.]com[\/caption]\r\nConclusion\r\nIn summary, domain squatting techniques leverage the fact that users rely on domain names to identify brands and services on the Internet. These squatting domains are often used for nefarious activities, including phishing, malware and PUP distribution, C2 and various scams. A high rate of malicious and suspicious usage among squatting domains was observed. Therefore, continuous monitoring and analysis of these domains are necessary to protect users.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks monitors newly registered domains and newly observed hostnames from pDNS and Zone files to capture emerging squatting campaigns. Our automatic pipeline publishes the domains it detects to URL Filtering and DNS Security using the appropriate category, including malware, phishing, C2 or grayware.\r\n\r\nAnalyzing the squatting ecosystem, we found that domain squatters prefer certain types of target domains, registrars, hosting services and certificate authorities. The following attributes are common in cases of malicious squatted domains:\r\n\r\n \tDomain names that are targeting known financial, shopping and banking domains.\r\n \tDomains that use frequently abused registrars and hosting services.\r\n \tDomains that do not have completely validated SSL certificates.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we advise everyone to be more careful when encountering these domains.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks customers using URL Filtering, DNS Security, WildFire and Threat Prevention are protected from the threats related to squatting domains mentioned in this blog. Using AutoFocus, our customers can further study the malware mentioned in this blog by using the tag AzoRult.\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nSpecial thanks to Daiping Liu, Kelvin Kwan, Laura Novak, Jun Javier Wang, Vicky Ray, Eddy Rivera, Erica Naone and Arun Kumar for their help with improving the blog.\r\nIOCs\r\nSha256\r\n5acd6d9ac235104f90f9a39c11807c37cdfb103d6c151cc1a2e4e38bf3dbe41f\r\n\r\nfa28b59eb0ccd21d3994b0778946679497399b72c2e256ebf2434553cb7bf373\r\n\r\ne7fb436bf7d8784da092315bce1d3511a6055da41fe67362bad7a4c5d3f0294e\r\nJA3 Pair\r\nClient JA3: 6312930a139fa3ed22b87abb75c16afa\r\n\r\nSever JA3: 4192c0a946c5bd9b544b4656d9f624a4\r\nMalware\/Phishing Squatting Hostname\r\namazon-india[.]online\r\n\r\napple.com.recover[.]support\r\n\r\ncom-finder-me[.]info\r\n\r\ncom-secure-login[.]info\r\n\r\nfacebook.com-account-login-manage.yourfiresale[.]com\r\n\r\nicloud.com-iphone[.]support\r\n\r\nmicrosoft-alert[.]club\r\n\r\nmicrosoft-sback-server[.]com\r\n\r\nmicrosoft-store-drm-server[.]com\r\n\r\nmicrosof\u0167[.]com (xn--microsof-wyb[.]com)\r\n\r\nnetflix-payments[.]com\r\n\r\nnetflixbrazilcovid[.]com\r\n\r\nrbyroyalbank[.]com\r\n\r\nsafety.microsoft.com.mdmfmztwjj.l6kan7uf04p102xmpq[.]bid\r\n\r\nsamsungeblyaiphone[.]com\r\n\r\nsamsungpr0mo[.]online\r\n\r\nsecure-wellsfargo[.]org\r\n\r\nstore-in-box[.]com\r\n\r\nstt-box[.]com\r\n\r\nwww.icloud.com-secure-login[.]info\r\nGrayware Hostname\r\n4ever21[.]com\r\n\r\nfacebookwinners2020[.]com\r\n\r\nmicposoft[.]com\r\n\r\nwalrmart44[.]com\r\n\r\nwhatsalpp[.]com\r\nURL\r\nsamsungeblyaiphone[.]com\/dolce.exe\r\n\r\nsamsungeblyaiphone[.]com\/index.php\r\nIP\r\n217.182.227[.]117\r\n\r\n \tAnti-cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) (15 USC \u00a71125(d)) \u2191\r\n","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@id":"#panworg"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/unit42.paloaltonetworks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Cybersquatting-v3.png","width":150,"height":75},"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Zhanhao Chen"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Janos Szurdi"}]}</script><link rel='stylesheet' id='crayon-css'  href='https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/plugins/crayon-syntax-highlighter/css/min/crayon.min.css?ver=_2.7.2_beta' type='text/css' media='all' />

<p>Users on the internet rely on domain names to find brands, services, professionals and personal websites. Cybercriminals take advantage of the essential role that domain names play on the internet by registering names that appear related to existing domains or brands, with the intent of profiting from user mistakes. This is known as cybersquatting. The purpose of squatting domains is to confuse users into believing that the targeted brands (such as Netflix) own these domain names (such as <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>netflix</strong>-payments[.]com</span>) or to profit from users’ typing mistakes (such as <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">whatsa<strong>l</strong>pp[.]com</span> for WhatsApp). While cybersquatting is not always malicious toward users, it is illegal in the U.S.,<sup><sup><a id="post-108453-footnote-ref-0" href="#post-108453-footnote-0">[1]</a></sup></sup> and squatting domains are often used or repurposed for attacks.</p>
<p>The Palo Alto Networks squatting detector system discovered that 13,857 squatting domains were registered in December 2019, an average of 450 per day. We found that 2,595 (18.59%) squatted domain names are malicious, often distributing malware or conducting phishing attacks, and 5,104 (36.57%) squatting domains we studied present a high risk to users visiting them, meaning they have evidence of association with malicious URLs within the domain or are utilizing <a href="https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-new-features/content-inspection-features/edl-for-bulletproof-isps">bulletproof hosting</a>.</p>
<p>We also ranked the Top 20 most abused domains in December 2019 based on adjusted malicious rate, which means that a domain is either a target of many squatting domains or most of these squatting domains are confirmed malicious. We found that domain squatters prefer profitable targets, such as mainstream search engines and social media, financial, shopping and banking websites. When visiting these sites, users are often prepared to share sensitive information, which opens them up to phishing and scams to steal sensitive credentials or money if they can be deceived into visiting a squatting domain instead.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-108518" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chart-18.png" alt="This graph ranks the Top 20 most abused domains, using an &quot;adjusted malicious rate&quot; metric to determine which domains are the favored targets of the practice of cybersquatting. " width="900" height="707" /></p>
<p>From December 2019 to date, we observed a variety of malicious domains with different objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phishing: </strong>A domain mimicking Wells Fargo (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">secure-<strong>wellsfargo</strong>[.]org</span>) targeting customers to steal sensitive information, including email credentials and ATM PINs. Also, a domain mimicking Amazon (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>amazon</strong>-india[.]online</span>) set up to steal user credentials, specifically targeting mobile users in India.</li>
<li><strong>Malware distribution: </strong>A domain mimicking Samsung (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>samsung</strong>eblya<strong>iphone</strong>[.]com</span>) hosting Azorult malware to steal credit card information.</li>
<li><strong>Command and control (C2): </strong>Domains mimicking Microsoft (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">microsoft-store-drm-server[.]com</span> and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">microsoft-sback-server[.]com</span>) attempting to conduct C2 attacks to compromise an entire network.</li>
<li><strong>Re-bill scam:</strong> Several phishing sites mimicking Netflix (such as <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>netflix</strong>brazilcovid[.]com</span>) set up to steal victims’ money by first offering a small initial payment for a subscription to a product like weight loss pills. However, if users don’t cancel the subscription after the promotion period, a much higher cost will be charged to their credit cards, usually $50-100.</li>
<li><strong>Potentially unwanted program (PUP): </strong>Domains mimicking Walmart (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>walrmart</strong>44[.]com</span>) and Samsung (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>samsung</strong>pr0mo[.]online</span>) distributing PUP, such as spyware, adware or a browser extension. They usually perform unwanted changes, like changing the browser&#8217;s default page or hijacking the browser to insert ads. Of note, the Samsung domain looks like a legitimate Australia educational news website.</li>
<li><strong>Technical support scam:</strong> Domains mimicking Microsoft (such as <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>microsoft</strong>-alert[.]club</span>) trying to scare users into paying for fake customer support.</li>
<li><strong>Reward scam: </strong>A domain mimicking Facebook (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>facebook</strong>winners2020[.]com</span>) scamming users with rewards, such as free products or money. To claim the prize, users need to fill out a form with their personal information such as date of birth, phone number, occupation and income.</li>
<li><strong>Domain parking: </strong>A domain mimicking RBC Royal Bank (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">rby<strong>royalbank</strong>[.]com</span>) leveraging a popular parking service, ParkingCrew, to generate profit based on how many users land on the site and click the advertisements.</li>
</ul>
<p>We studied domain squatting techniques including typosquatting, combosquatting, level-squatting, bitsquatting and homograph-squatting (all defined below). Malicious actors can use these techniques to distribute malware or to conduct scams and phishing campaigns.</p>
<p>To detect squatting domains, Palo Alto Networks developed an automated system to capture emerging campaigns from <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/newly-registered-domains-malicious-abuse-by-bad-actors/">newly registered domains</a>, as well as from passive DNS (pDNS) data. We continue to detect currently active cybersquatting domains – we identify malicious and suspicious squatting domains and designate them to the appropriate categories (such as phishing, malware, C2 or grayware). Protections against domains classified in these categories are available in multiple Palo Alto Networks security subscriptions, including <a href="https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-admin/url-filtering.html">URL Filtering</a> and <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/threat-detection-and-prevention/dns-security">DNS Security</a>.</p>
<p>We recommend that enterprises block and closely monitor traffic from these domains, while consumers should make sure that they type domain names correctly and double-check that the domain owners are trusted before entering any site.

<h2><a id="post-108453-_3wn0jswbh2wv"></a><strong>Squatting Techniques</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Typosquatting</strong> is one of the most common types of domain registration abuse. Typosquatters intentionally register misspelled variants (such as <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">whatsa<strong>l</strong>pp[.]com</span>) of target domain names (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">whatsapp[.]com</span>) to profit from users’ typing mistakes or to deceive users into believing that they are visiting the correct target domain. The most frequent typosquatting techniques include registering names one edit distance from the original domain, as these are the most common and overlooked mistakes users make. For more information, readers can refer to academic research papers on the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-szurdi.pdf">scale</a> and <a href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/290976">malicious use</a> of typosquatting.</p>
<p><strong>Combosquatting </strong>is another widespread registration abuse that combines popular trademarks with words such as “security,” “payment” or “verification.” Combosquatting domains like <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>netflix</strong>-payments[.]com</span> are often used in phishing emails, by scam websites and for social engineering attacks to convince users that they are visiting web content maintained by the targeted trademark. For more information, readers can refer to this academic paper on a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3133956.3134002">longitudinal study of combosquatting</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Homographsquatting </strong>domains take advantage of internationalized domain names (IDNs), where Unicode characters are allowed (such as <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">microsof<strong>ŧ</strong>[.]com</span>). Attackers usually replace one or more characters in the target domain with visually similar characters from another language. These domains can be perfectly indistinguishable from their targets, as in the case of apple.com, where the English letter &#8220;a&#8221; (U+0061) was replaced with the Cyrillic letter &#8220;а&#8221; (U+0430). For more information, readers can refer to academic research papers on <a href="http://liubaojun.org/uploads/1/1/8/3/118316462/internationalized-domain-dsn18.pdf">IDNs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Soundsquatting</strong> domains take advantage of homophones, i.e., words that sound alike (for example, <em>weather</em> and<em> whether</em>). Attackers can register homophone variants of popular domains, such as <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>4</strong>ever21[.]com</span> for <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>for</strong>ever21[.]com</span>. As text-to-speech software like Siri and Google Assistant becomes prevalent, more and more users will become vulnerable to the abuse of soundsquatting domains. For more information, readers can refer to this academic research paper on <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-13257-0_17">soundsquatting</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Bitsquatting </strong>domains have a character that differs in one bit (such as <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">mic<strong>p</strong>osoft[.]com</span>) from the same character as the targeted legitimate domain (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">mic<strong>r</strong>osoft[.]com</span>). Bitsquatting can benefit attackers because a hardware error can cause a random bit-flip in memory where domain names are stored temporarily. Thus, even though users type the correct domains, they may still be led to malicious ones. Although such hardware errors are usually rare, an academic research paper has shown that <a href="https://www.securitee.org/files/bitsquatting_www2013.pdf">bitsquatting is a real threat</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Levelsquatting</strong> domains, such as the case of <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">safety.<strong>microsoft.com</strong>.mdmfmztwjj.l6kan7uf04p102xmpq[.]bid</span>, include the targeted brand’s domain name as a subdomain. In this example, the victims of the phishing attack might believe they are visiting <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">safety.<strong>microsoft.com</strong></span>, when instead, they are visiting the attacker’s website. This attack is especially worrisome for mobile users because the browser&#8217;s address bar might not be wide enough to display the entire domain name. For more information, readers can refer to this academic paper for a more comprehensive study of <a href="https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/zhouli/files/2019/07/securecomm19.pdf">levelsquatting domains</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="post-108453-_v627h326czko"></a><strong>Detection of Various Squatting Techniques</strong></h2>
<p>We leverage lexical analysis to detect candidate squatting domains among the Palo Alto Networks <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/newly-registered-domains-malicious-abuse-by-bad-actors/">newly registered domain (NRD)</a> and pDNS feeds. Our list of target domains is the combination of popular domains in general and domains popular in specific categories, such as shopping and business. We generate the aforementioned squatting variants of the target domains, and match them against our NRD feed and pDNS hostnames. Additionally, we cluster weekly collections of NRDs to see if registration campaigns target known brands. After the initial discovery step, we leverage WHOIS data to filter out <a href="https://icannwiki.org/Defensive_Registration">defensive registrations</a> and a heuristic rule-based classifier to identify which domains are true squatting domains.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the daily detection statistics for December 2019. During this period, we detected 13,857 squatting domains (~450 per day). Since then, the number of daily detections fluctuate from 200-900. To understand how these domains are leveraged for abuse, we use <a href="https://urlfiltering.paloaltonetworks.com/">URL Filtering</a> to categorize them. We label domain names as <strong>malicious</strong> if they are involved in distributing malware or phishing, or if they are being used for command and control (C2) communication. We label domains categorized as grayware, parked, questionable, insufficient content and high-risk as <strong>suspicious</strong>. The average malicious rate of the 13,857 squatting domains is 18.59% (2,595) and the average suspicious rate is 36.57% (5,104).</p>
<figure id="attachment_108520" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108520" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-108520" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chart-19.png" alt="The graph shows daily figures for cybersquatting during December 2019.

Volume and malicious and suspicious rates of daily domain squatting in December 2019.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, we compare our detection of squatting domains to vendors found on VirusTotal. Considering detection delays, we allow a 10-day time window for malicious squatting domains to appear on VirusTotal. Figure 2 shows how well the top 10 vendors detected these malicious and high-risk domains. The best-performing vendor covers about 25% of the malicious or high-risk squatting domains that we detected. Meanwhile, other vendors cover less than 20% of our detections. Lastly, we found that 55% of malicious or high-risk squatting domains are not detected by any vendors.</p>

Malicious and high-risk squatting domain detection on VirusTotal in December 2019.</figcaption></figure>
<h2><a id="post-108453-_7n1lqaaell9c"></a><strong>The Domain Squatting Ecosystem</strong></h2>
<p>To identify malicious infrastructure hotspots, we studied specific network elements and entities that typosquatters depend on for their operations. Specifically, we studied popular registrars, name services, autonomous systems and certificate authorities used by domain squatters.</p>
<p>For each chart outlined below, we considered the number of squatting detections to reflect their popularity among domain squatters, and the malicious IOC rate to quantify the degree of threat to users. Combining these two metrics, we calculated the adjusted malicious rate of each entity. Thus, a high adjusted malicious rate means that an entity is either targeted by many squatting domains or most of these squatting domains are malicious.</p>
<h4><a id="post-108453-_og21kov88uox"></a>Top 20 Most Abused Domains</h4>
<p>Domain squatters prefer popular and thus profitable targets. Figure 3 shows the Top 20 most abused domains. These targets are popular websites, such as mainstream search engines and social media, financial, shopping and banking websites. Squatting domains mimicking these websites benefit from their credibility to attract more users that can be scammed. Therefore, these targets have relatively high squatting detection numbers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108524" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108524" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-108524" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chart-21.png" alt="The Top 20 domains most abused by cybersquatting in December 2019 include paypal.com, apple.com, royalbank.com, netflix.com, linkedin.com, amazon.com, dropbox.com, tripadvisor.com, bankofamerica.com, banorte.com, icloud.com, panda.tv, facebook.com, google.com, microsoft.com, norton.com, steamcommunity.com, shopee.tw, instagram.com and suddenlink.net.

<h4><a id="post-108453-_tqptdfg0e35s"></a>Top 10 Most Abused DNS Services and Autonomous Systems</h4>
<p>Next, we look at the DNS services and the autonomous systems (AS) used by squatting domains to understand their infrastructure preferences. An AS is a set of IP subnets maintained by one or more network operators.</p>
<p>The name service used by domain squatters often signifies which registrar was used to register the domain, where the squatting web page is hosted or which parking service these domains utilize to profit from user traffic. Figure 4 displays the most abused name services of squatting domains. Freenom.com and dnspod.com are often used by domain squatters, as they provide cheap or free domain registration and domain hosting. DNSPod is known for <a href="https://abuse.ch/blog/dot-bit-the-next-generation-of-bulletproof-hosting/">hosting shady DNS records</a> and for providing services for malicious bulletproof hosting operators. Level-squatters might choose to use registrar.eu as it supports an unlimited number of subdomains and free URL forwarding, which reduces the cost of deploying and scaling attacks.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-108526" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chart-22.png" alt="Ranked by adjusted malicious rate, the top 10 DNS services most abused by cybersquatting in December 2019 are freenom.com, registrar.eu, ddos-guard.net, dnspod.com, parkingcrew.net, above.com, rookdns.com, namebrightdns, natrohost.com and foundationapi.com" width="900" height="412" /></p>
<figure id="attachment_108528" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108528" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-108528" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chart-23.png" alt="This graph shows the top 10 DNS services most abused by cybersquatting in December 2019, this time in terms of squatting detected (blue bars) and malicious IOC (red bars)" width="900" height="412" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-108528" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4. Top 10 most abused DNS services in December 2019.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, parkingcrew.net and above.com are popular parking services because they provide a simple monetization avenue to domain owners, achieved by pointing domain names’ DNS records to their name servers. Parking services usually show users parked pages laden with ads or redirect users to affiliate marketing or malicious websites.</p>
<p>As hosting services often have their own AS, we observed that the AS distribution is somewhat consistent with the name service distribution. The top three most abused AS (19495, 48635, 262254) belong to the three most abused name service providers, respectively (freenom.com, registrar.eu, ddos-guard.net). The fourth most abused AS (40034) is owned by ztomy.com, a service <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/hijacking-of-dns-records-from-network-solutions">favored for DNS hijacking attacks</a>.</p>

<h4><a id="post-108453-_tgjhywqtjqby"></a>Top 10 Most Abused Registrars</h4>
<p>Registrars are entities that sell domain names to users. The most abused registrar, Internet.bs, provides free services preferred by domain squatters, including privacy-protected registration and URL forwarding. We captured several level-squatting campaigns at this registrar. In these campaigns, attackers set up hundreds of subdomains mimicking popular target domains under <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">com-secure-login[.]info</span> and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">com-finder-me[.]info</span>. An example level-squatting subdomain is <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">www.<strong>icloud.com</strong>-secure-login[.]info</span>. The second-most abused registrar, Openprovider, offers cheap and easy bulk registrations, attracting many squatting registrations. Additionally, we observed many domains from this registrar having their WHOIS records redacted for privacy. Our system discovered many level-squatting domains registered at TLD Registrar Solutions using the .support TLD (top-level domain), including <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>icloud.com</strong>-iphone[.]support</span> and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>apple.com</strong>.recover[.]support</span>, which users might confuse with legitimate Apple technical support services.</p>

<h4><a id="post-108453-_sidpacv6lro3"></a>Top 5 Most Abused Certificate Authorities</h4>
<p>As HTTPS became common, cybercriminals increased the use of certificates to make their websites appear legitimate. Figure 7 provides an overview of the certificate authorities (CAs) preferred by squatting sites. The most popular CA is Cloudflare, as it offers a bundle, including free SSL encryption. The second most popular CA, cPanel Inc CA, is preferred by domain squatters because of the convenience and the ease of its AutoSSL services. Through cPanel’s management interface, their customers are able to finish all steps of SSL encryption, including certificate purchase, automatic installation and renewal. Thawte CA is not a trusted CA anymore, and browsers will label their certificate as suspicious, but squatting domains are still using it.</p>

<h2><a id="post-108453-_ti8vep1qm7ty"></a><strong>Malicious Usages and Threats</strong></h2>
<p>In this section, we discuss in detail different types of abuse leveraging squatting domains. It includes malware distribution, phishing, C2 communication, potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), scams, ad-laden sites and affiliate marketing.</p>
<h4><a id="post-108453-_1mb7dpy5z5m2"></a>Phishing</h4>
<p>Phishing is one of the most popular threats leveraging squatting domains. All of the different squatting techniques we discussed can be used to lure users into believing that a squatting domain is owned by the legitimate brand and to increase the efficiency of phishing and scam campaigns.</p>
<p>One example is a combosquatting domain, <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">secure-<strong>wellsfargo</strong>[.]org</span>, which targets Wells Fargo’s customers. This domain hosts a copy of Wells Fargo’s official site, as illustrated in Figure 8.a. However, this site is only the front-end portion of the original site, redirecting all clicks to the same login page (shown in Figure 8.b) to steal customers’ sensitive information, including email credentials and ATM PINs.</p>

As a common strategy, all links on this site first redirect users to the same product page (the middle screenshot in Figure 9) and then to the payment page. In this particular case, the perpetrators did not even go through the trouble of optimizing the phishing page for desktop users.</p>

<h4><a id="post-108453-_wg0s0i6xoqyd"></a>Malware Distribution</h4>
<p>Squatting domains are also often used to distribute malware. A combosquatting domain mimicking Samsung (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>samsung</strong>eblya<strong>iphone</strong>[.]com</span>) hosts Azorult malware <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">5acd6d9ac235104f90f9a39c11807c37cdfb103d6c151cc1a2e4e38bf3dbe41f</span> on the URL <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>samsung</strong>eblya<strong>iphone</strong>[.]com/dolce.exe</span>. Azorult malware is a credential and payment card information stealer, usually spread by phishing emails. It has been an active threat since 2016 and is <a href="https://any.run/malware-trends/azorult">one of the top malware families</a>. Once the malware executes, it will generate a unique identifier for the compromised machine based on the machine’s globally unique identifier and username. Then the malware will contact the C2 server with this identifier, and it will retrieve the configuration of the infected machine, including the running processes and services. Additionally, Azorult malware often downloads payload from other compromised servers. The new payload can collect and send out sensitive data such as cookies, browser credentials and cryptocurrency information.</p>
<p>Analyzing the malware sample downloaded from <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>samsung</strong>eblya<strong>iphone</strong>[.]com</span>, we found that it attempted to send a POST request to <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>samsung</strong>eblya<strong>iphone</strong>[.]com/index.php</span>, which is consistent with this malware family’s <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-new-wine-old-bottle-new-azorult-variant-found-findmyname-campaign-using-fallout-exploit-kit/">known behavior to exfiltrate data</a>. Besides the observed network activity, the malware also displayed suspicious behaviors such as changing the settings of Internet Explorer.</p>
<h4><a id="post-108453-_iwld9ghg8awg"></a>Command &amp; Control (C2)</h4>
<p>Malware instances on infected machines typically need to “phone home” to a C2 server for further commands to execute, to download new payloads or to perform data exfiltration. Malware often relies on domain names to locate C2 servers, and these domains are called C2 domains. While using squatting domains for C2 is uncommon, we speculate that the intention of those who do so is to evade automated detection (such as Domain Generation Algorithm detection) and manual analysis.</p>
<p>Our squatting detection system captured squatting domains mimicking Microsoft, <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>microsoft</strong>-store-drm-server[.]com</span> on January 30, 2020, and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>microsoft</strong>-sback-server[.]com</span> on February 3, 2020. From the Palo Alto Networks <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire">WildFire Malware Analysis Engine</a>, we retrieved similar malware samples, including <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">fa28b59eb0ccd21d3994b0778946679497399b72c2e256ebf2434553cb7bf373</span> and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">e7fb436bf7d8784da092315bce1d3511a6055da41fe67362bad7a4c5d3f0294e</span> , connecting to them. These two domain names used the previously mentioned DNSPod for name resolution, <a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/news/article/784/">which is infamous for being slow in responding to abuse investigations</a>. First, the malware resolved these domains to the same IP address <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">217.182.227[.]117</span>. Then, it communicated through SSL traffic with the same <a href="https://github.com/salesforce/ja3">JA3 (SSL fingerprint)</a>: 6312930a139fa3ed22b87abb75c16afa on client-side and 4192c0a946c5bd9b544b4656d9f624a4 on server-side. Observing the same behavior, we conclude they were using the identical SSL application and were part of the same campaign.</p>
<p>Similar to most C2 domains, these two squatting domains were short-lived. They were only used for one to two days after registration and were then abandoned by attackers. Tracking <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">217.182.227[.]117</span>, we are able to find other C2 domains used by this campaign: <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">store-in-box[.]com</span> from Jan. 27-28, <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">stt-box[.]com</span> from Jan. 29-31, <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>microsoft</strong>-store-drm-server[.]com</span> from Jan. 31-Feb. 2, and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>microsoft</strong>-sback-server[.]com</span> on February 3.</p>
<h4><a id="post-108453-_w7d1c65cguym"></a>Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP)</h4>
<p>A PUP could be either standalone software, like spyware or adware, or a browser extension. PUPs usually perform unwanted changes, like changing the browser&#8217;s default page or hijacking the browser to insert ads. Researchers have shown that some PUP downloaders are also <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3321705.3329807">repurposed for malware campaigns</a>. Websites hosting PUPs usually try to scare users by showing them warning messages like “Your computer is infected!” or “Your license has expired!” to convince them to download the advertised software.</p>
<p>Figure 10 shows a combosquatting domain mimicking Walmart (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>walrmart</strong>44[.]com</span>) that distributes PUP. Depending on the browser used, it redirects users to landing pages offering different types of PUPs for download. When we visit this domain in Safari, it tells us that our Flash player might be outdated and offers us the chance to download the newest version from their site, as illustrated in Figure 10.a. While using Chrome, we get a “click continue and install extension” page, as shown in Figure 10.b, which redirects users to the Chrome store for the “Security for Chrome” extension. Alternatively, this website will occasionally redirect users to various legitimate ecommerce websites, including Walmart, Amazon and Aliexpress. After repeated visits, it will remember the source IP address and reject further visits even if we use different browsers (Figure 10.c).</p>

<h4><a id="post-108453-_wq71v4azke5p"></a>Technical Support Scam</h4>
<p>Technical support scams are social engineering attacks. An associated website’s purpose is to scare people with audio and visual warnings into believing that their machine is compromised. It prompts people to call the displayed fake technical support center’s phone number. When people call the number, scammers will try to persuade them that the only way to save their machine is by paying for the fraudulent support service. In the case of combosquatting, the domain name often contains keywords like “security,” “alert” and “warning.” An example domain mimicking Microsoft (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>microsoft</strong>-alert[.]club</span>) shown in Figure 12.a was registered on June 11, 2020. This website presents warning messages in Japanese (translated to English in Figure 12.b), renders dynamic content, such as a running command line window, and plays audio alerts.</p>

<h4><a id="post-108453-_2tf1nm9it31f"></a>Re-bill Scam</h4>
<p>Re-bill scammers first offer a subscription to products such as weight loss pills in exchange for a small initial payment. However, if users don’t cancel the subscription after the promotion period, a much higher cost will be charged to their credit cards, usually $50-100. Additional information on this type of scam can be found in Unit 42’s previous research on <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/takedowns-and-adventures-in-deceptive-affiliate-marketing/">deceptive affiliate marketing</a>. The combosquatting domain <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>netflix</strong>brazilcovid[.]com</span> leverages both Netflix and the COVID-19 pandemic. The main page looks like the Portuguese Netflix site (Figure 13.a), and has the purpose of obtaining user email addresses. (It is shown translated to English in Figure 13.b.) A deceptive reward message (Figure 13.c) is then shown to potential victims. Finally, users are redirected to a survey and then to a re-bill scam page (Figure 13.d).</p>

<h4><a id="post-108453-_n55vkasjny05"></a>Reward Scam</h4>
<p>Another popular scam offers users rewards such as free products or money. When we initially captured <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><strong>facebook</strong>winners2020[.]com</span>, it was under development with placeholder images and texts, as shown in Figure 14.a. However, the perpetrators recently replaced placeholders with meaningful content. From the screenshot, we could tell the page mimics a free lottery related to Facebook. To claim the prize, users need to fill out a form with their personal information such as date of birth, phone number, occupation and income (Figure 14.b).</p>

<h4><a id="post-108453-_9uuoiobspqdt"></a>Domain Parking</h4>
<p>A common and easy way to monetize user traffic is to use a parking service by pointing the squatting domain’s IP address or NS record to the parking service’s servers. Figure 15 provides an example of a parked domain mimicking RBC Royal Bank, <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><em>rby</em><strong><em>royalbank</em></strong><em>[.]com</em></span>, leveraging a popular parking service, ParkingCrew, to generate profit based on how many users land on the site and click the advertisements. In some cases, parking services also redirect users to scam and phishing pages. As the hostname in the certificate is different from the squatting domain, the browser will label it as “Not secure.” Parked pages usually show users a list of advertisements related to the parked domain. In our example, the ads shown are related to financial services.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108578" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108578" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-108578" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/word-image-71.png" alt="This shows an example of how cybersquatting domains sometimes take advantage of parking services.

<h2><a id="post-108453-_qr7dzpgcw1a9"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>In summary, domain squatting techniques leverage the fact that users rely on domain names to identify brands and services on the Internet. These squatting domains are often used for nefarious activities, including phishing, malware and PUP distribution, C2 and various scams. A high rate of malicious and suspicious usage among squatting domains was observed. Therefore, continuous monitoring and analysis of these domains are necessary to protect users.</p>
<p>Palo Alto Networks monitors newly registered domains and newly observed hostnames from pDNS and Zone files to capture emerging squatting campaigns. Our automatic pipeline publishes the domains it detects to URL Filtering and DNS Security using the appropriate category, including malware, phishing, C2 or grayware.</p>
<p>Analyzing the squatting ecosystem, we found that domain squatters prefer certain types of target domains, registrars, hosting services and certificate authorities. The following attributes are common in cases of malicious squatted domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain names that are targeting known financial, shopping and banking domains.</li>
<li>Domains that use frequently abused registrars and hosting services.</li>
<li>Domains that do not have completely validated SSL certificates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, we advise everyone to be more careful when encountering these domains.</p>
