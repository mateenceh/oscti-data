In this blog, I\u2019ll be covering two aspects of multi-year affiliate marketing spam campaigns designed to deceive individuals, scam, and profit off of people\u2019s desire to change their lives.\r\n\r\nFirst, I\u2019ll provide an overview of a spam campaign sent to some customers that led me down this more than two year rabbit hole, and then dig into the inner workings. This blog covers a number of topics: data collection, analysis, and enumeration of infrastructure. These efforts allowed us to map out thousands of compromised servers and abused domains and hundreds of compromised accounts, resulting in a collaborative effort with GoDaddy to take down over 15,000 subdomains being used across these campaigns.\r\nIntroduction\r\nOn a scale of 1 to 10 for the \u201cWorst Types of Spam\u201d you can receive, approaching that perfect 10 score is spam related to \u201csnake oil\u201d products that are so patently fake that you struggle to understand why they would even bother trying to sell it. You know the ones I\u2019m talking about. The late night, 3A.M. insomnia, as-seen-on-TV, \u201cmiracle\u201d products that use laughably bad actors to try and sell you laughably bad products\u2026for a limited time only!\r\n\r\nAt some point the 3A.M. commercials of yesteryear became all-day e-mails, social media posts, and other forms of invasive advertising that have weaseled their way into our daily lives. So much so that sometimes they just begin to blend into the minutiae of things bombarding us constantly and become part of our expected usage experience; we begin to just glaze over them without giving them a second thought. That\u2019s exactly what was happening to me for a particular campaign of spam that I was seeing every now and then but didn\u2019t give much thought to. It went on for over two years and I began noticing slight variations every month until something clicked and what once was background noise now was something of interest.\r\n\r\nAt first it\u2019s easy to look past them \u2013 \u201cAh! Just another weight loss pill\u201d or \u201cYes! I\u2019m sure this totally legit Canadian pharmacy has you covered for pain medications.\u201d However, as I began to notice a pattern in the visual structure across some of these spam websites it piqued my interest. Over two years I had watched some of these sites and could identify a template being used that slowly morphed over time, selling different products, and always using different URLs to mask their intentions, but visually appearing quite similar.\r\n\r\nMaybe you\u2019ll recognize one of them if you\u2019ve ever been adventurous enough to see where a random link in an e-mail would take you.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Deceptive scam pages\r\nAt times, it was clear, based on domains like \u201ckeywestinns[.]com\u201d, that there was something a little more nefarious going on. When I started to investigate, I was seeing hundreds of different domains, with lots of them showing signs of compromise, and quite clearly NOT intended for the spam being used on their infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWhen the act of sending unsolicited offers crosses the line from annoyance to dabbling in illegal acts, then the everyday spam becomes a lot more interesting.\r\n\r\nAnd with that dear readers, it\u2019s time to gather around the camp fire as we go down some rabbit holes on a journey of exploration into the magical mystical world of affiliate marketing spam.\r\nInitial Patterns of Shadiness\r\nTo begin, I feel it\u2019s best to highlight some of the spam that initially piqued my interest.\r\n\r\nStarting in early 2017, I began making a mental note of these sites purporting celebrity endorsements for weight loss and \u201cbrain enhancement\u201d pills. In our process of analysis, we\u2019re presented with an array of screenshots from the virtual systems that crawl these websites; this is why after seeing these images time and time again they eventually became ingrained in my mind and I could start to recognize templates being used and their slight variations over time.\r\n\r\nThus, I present to you some of the first campaigns that I observed throughout 2017. Note the structural similarities as I go through them.\r\n\r\nStyle A) \u201cStephen Hawking Predicts, \u2018This Pill Will Change Humanity\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2. Stephen Hawking variant\r\nA lofty claim for sure and who wouldn\u2019t believe what Stephen Hawking says to Wolf Blitzer as reported on Forbes? While this campaign phased out, there was another running in parallel with the same tactics but a different product, switching from \u201cbrain supplements\u201d to \u201cweight loss.\u201d It keeps the celebrity endorsement theme and continues masquerading as a legitimate website.\r\n\r\nStyle B) \u201cGwen Stefani Shares Blake Shelton\u2019s Secret To Rapid Weight Loss\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3. Gwen Stefani variant\r\nI\u2019ll touch on the domains in a minute but note that this domain is crafted specifically for this fake endorsement. It masquerades as the legitimate \u201cTMZ\u201d website with a domain using the brand in the name - \u201cweightloss4tmz[.]com\u201d.\r\n\r\nAfter these two died off, two new campaigns began popping-up around early-2018 and are still active as of today.\r\n\r\nStyle C) \u201cWhy Every Judge On Shark Tank Backed This Product from\u201d \u2013 Lacey Brown\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4. Shark Tank variant 1\r\nStyle D) \u201cWhy Every Judge On Shark Tank Backed This Product from\u201d \u2013 Lacey Johnson\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5. Shark Tank variant 2\r\nWhen you see them next to each other, the templates become more apparent in the stylization of their structured layouts.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the URLs on display in the above screenshots are not what the initial phishing URL looks like, but they are where you eventually end up after, sometimes, 3-4 redirects away from their point of origin. When I finally decided to do some research on these campaigns and figure out what was going on, this detail made initial identification a bit trickier.\r\n\r\nBelow is a table showing the original URLs and the domains where they ended up in the four images above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStyle\r\nPrimary Redirector\r\nLanding Page\r\n\r\n\r\nHawking\r\ntest.303[.]lt\/captchaimage.php?island=asevp275rbaahnz92\r\nthelimitlessmind[.]asia\r\n\r\n\r\nStefani\r\nwww.printercustomersupportonline[.]com\/500error.php?method=283hyxr6r8hew\r\nweightloss4tmz[.]com\r\n\r\n\r\nSharkTankV1\r\nargentina.urbansquares[.]com\/efvpmubb.php?er608q1=h6cmt\r\nhealth4burnfats[.]world\r\n\r\n\r\nSharkTankV2\r\ncinematto[.]ch\/wp-content\/plugins\/linklove\/profiles\/e080403.php?engine=nyq1an0gq1kt02v\r\nfastdiet4lines[.]world\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1. Redirection URL per variant\r\nAs I started to manually sift through the URLs I processed, looking for past samples to collect from each campaign, I noticed an interesting pattern that spanned across the URLs going back years. Specifically, the initial redirection page was commonly using a PHP file with a single parameter that was typically a simple English word followed by a mix of alphanumeric characters. It was enough to create a regular expression and match additional sites but I kept finding outliers where it wasn\u2019t always consistent, such as in the above SharkTankV1 sample, and I needed to find a way to collect more holistic data.\r\n\r\nI needed a way of identifying all of the campaign variants we\u2019d seen over the past few years without relying on the initial URL from the phishing email. A tricky problem to be sure. In addition, I still wanted to identify the \u201cbit[.]ly\u201d and \u201cgoo[.]gl\u201d type shortening services, the redirectors, and in some cases the landing pages to see if any patterns appeared - basically, whatever a potential victim saw. Thus, the only consistent piece of the puzzle I had at that point were the images from our virtual systems used for analysis, so I decided to start from there and work my way backwards.\r\nSpam Cartography\r\nI reviewed a number of methodologies on image comparison and settled on Mean Squared Error (MSE). This technique essentially generates a measurement score based on the average of the squares of errors, or in this context the difference between pixel intensity of the two compared images. As every screenshot was of the same size and general layout within the virtual machine, this relatively simple method proved quite accurate at scale.\r\n\r\nUsing this fabulous blog I cobbled together a Python script that iterated over 42,000 images from our virtual systems where URLs were sent for manual analysis. I did this for each campaign \u201cstyle\u201d and reported back matches that I then could use to walk back to the submitted URL, after which I manually scraped out the landing page URLs.\r\n\r\nBelow are some statistics on how many unique sites and domains were collected following this methodology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStyle\r\nTotal Submissions\r\nUnique Source URL\r\nUnique Landing Domain\r\n\r\n\r\nHawking\r\n256\r\n81\r\n54\r\n\r\n\r\nStefani\r\n93\r\n38\r\n21\r\n\r\n\r\nSharkTankV1\r\n443\r\n217\r\n71\r\n\r\n\r\nSharkTankV2\r\n108\r\n39\r\n19\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 2. Campaign variant statistics\r\nOne thing that was immediately surprising to me was the sheer number of unique, purchased landing page domains used for these campaigns.\r\n\r\nWith a sizable corpus of samples from each campaign, I began looking at them deeper to understand how the flow of events occurred and to try and answer the question: how does one actually land on any of these pages?\r\n\r\nAfter speaking with some of our customers, hunting for various URLs, and reviewing quite a few other research blogs, I was able to put together a pretty clear chain of events.\r\n\r\n \tUser clicks a link from spam e-mails, random\/hijacked Skype messages, Facebook ads, and Twitter posts.\r\n \tUser ends up on a redirection site, which were usually legitimate sites compromised in some way, which may involve a few hops.\r\n \tUser ends up on a fake celebrity endorsement landing page.\r\n \tUser ends up ultimately on a sales page for the product being sold.\r\n\r\nFigure 6 shows an in-the-wild example that maps out each step:\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6. Chain of events from original source to destination\r\nStarting with the compromised site portion of the chain seemed like an ideal choice to focus on but I could tell from the samples I\u2019d already collected that not all of them used the PHP file for redirection. In fact, as I started to look at each of the campaigns and chains in more detail, I identified multiple styles in how the redirection was occurring at this phase.\r\n\r\nUsing RiskIQ\u2019s PassiveTotal service to pivot on sites that redirected to or from the compromised sites, I was able to map out 689 landing pages that mapped back to a whopping 21,611 potentially compromised websites. I thought that was quite an extensive network for trying to push fake products so I continued digging.\r\n\r\nWhile looking at some of the metadata for the compromised sites, I stumbled across a tag in PassiveTotal created by one of their security researchers, Jordan Herman, called \u201cCaesarV\u201d. The description of their tag lined up perfectly with some of the activity I was seeing.\r\nThe CaesarV injection is using .php files on compromised site to drive traffic to fraudulent and\/or scam pages including fake tech support and fake sites purporting to be news sites reporting on the incredible effects of weightloss and intelligence pills. It is unclear whether it is also sending traffic malware at this time. The injection uses a Caesar cipher to obfuscate the method of redirection and the address to which traffic is being sent. This campaign appears to be long running, at least since the beginning of 2017 and possibly much longer.\r\nJordan sent me \u00a0a link to a September 2017 blog PassiveTotal released which featured the Stephen Hawking campaign shown in Figure 2). It detailed how the spammers were able to get access to one of the compromised servers and analyzed the PHP file handling the redirection.\r\n\r\nOf note was the use of a Caesar cipher to unmask the hardcoded landing pages to which potential victims would be redirected.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll briefly illustrate this style before covering the additional ones that I saw across my sample set.\r\nTraffic Redirection Styling\r\nCaesarV\r\nFor the CaesarV style, at the bottom of the redirect page there is JavaScript block that contains something like the below.\r\npursuea=24; pursueb=[128,140,140,136,82,71,71,136,138,135,124,141,123,140,76,124,129,125,140,70,143,135,138,132,124,71,87,121,85,76,73,79,79,78,80,62,123,85,123,136,123,124,129,125,140,62,139,85,75,77,79,78,77]; pursuec=\"\"; for(pursued=0;pursued&lt;pursueb.length;pursued++) { pursuec+=String.fromCharCode(pursueb[pursued]-pursuea); } window.top.location.href=pursuec;\r\nIt\u2019s just a basic array of integers, shifted in this case by \u201c24\u201d, that represent the ASCII characters which make up the URL.\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [128,140,140,136,82,71,71,136,138,135,124,141,123,140,76,124,129,125,140,70,143,135,138,132,124,71,87,121,85,76,73,79,79,78,80,62,123,85,123,136,123,124,129,125,140,62,139,85,75,77,79,78,77]\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \"\".join([chr(x - 24) for x in a])\r\n'http:\/\/product4diet[.]world\/?a=417768&amp;c=cpcdiet&amp;s=35765'\r\n\r\nJavaScript Variant 2\r\nAnother JavaScript variant that I frequently saw used a simple string ordering obfuscation to hide the URL before it rebuilds it.\r\nvar kbgo361 = 'h';\r\nvar elqwcafz962 = 't';\r\nvar yxkqcakbda622 = 't';\r\nvar fwvpixzxqktl166 = 'p';\r\nvar a173 = 's';\r\nvar jxatwangn716 = ':';\r\nvar iqt449 = '\/';\r\nvar zlovsta404 = '\/';\r\nvar sp811 = 'on=';\r\nvar rdzvxyaxbo26 = 'xoa139';\r\nvar qzcdsfakgdfxrd419 = 'ment';\r\nvar j56 = '.lo';\r\nvar iwzarqkozwkt588 = 'ti';\r\nvar mbxctnfabkctpvqro857 = 'docu';\r\nvar vnv639 = 't-lines.co';\r\nvar fcieo806 = 'm\/held.php';\r\nvar anmssiwwzfokxyxt304 = '?a=';\r\nvar ibtjenthjslooiilw172 = '1kB';\r\nvar ax83 = 'J&amp;c=diet&amp;s=10058';\r\nvar svxvv466 = '';\r\nvar bvengcktogsc110 = 'fastdie';\r\nvar xoa139 = 'ca';\r\nvar brndzqejxjhbvsro400 = '\"';\r\nif (rdzvxyaxbo26 = 'xoa139') {\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nsetTimeout (mbxctnfabkctpvqro857+qzcdsfakgdfxrd419+j56+xoa139+iwzarqkozwkt588+sp811+brndzqejxjhbvsro400+kbgo361+elqwcafz962+yxkqcakbda622+fwvpixzxqktl166+a173+jxatwangn716+iqt449+zlovsta404+svxvv466+bvengcktogsc110+vnv639+fcieo806+anmssiwwzfokxyxt304+ibtjenthjslooiilw172+ax83+brndzqejxjhbvsro400,916);\u00a0\r\n}\r\nThis redirects the browser to a PHP file on a landing page server:\r\nhttps:\/\/fastdiet-lines[.]com\/held.php?a=1kBJ&amp;c=diet&amp;s=10058\r\nThen this site uses a 303 \u201cSee Other\u201d HTTP request to redirect to the final landing page. It\u2019s worth noting at this point the parameters \u201ca\u201d (Affiliate), \u201cc\u201d (Campaign), and \u201cs\u201d (Sub) that are included in the above request.\r\nhttps:\/\/fastdiet-lines[.]com\/us\/wykc\/keto-all-desktop3?bhu=spctECr16tLfm14ZpdEZun3r45xPcSviq2L12u\r\n\r\n3XX Redirect Chain\r\nThe last dominant style I\u2019ll cover is a chaining of HTTP 3XX Redirection requests as illustrated in the example below.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7. 3XX Redirection chain\r\nAs an aside, all of the certificates I observed across these campaigns when HTTPS was used were issued by \u201cLet\u2019s Encrypt\u201d, which offers free and automated certificate creation quite commonly abused by malicious actors.\r\n\r\nWhile collecting these URLs, the 3XX style of redirection illuminated another area of clearly illegal activity. Over the past few months, I noticed a large influx in this style of redirect being pushed out and hitting my radar. While speaking with one of our customers to understand where they were receiving the initial URL\u2019s from, they sent me some of the \u201chundreds\u201d of e-mails they were receiving leading to these campaigns.\r\n\r\nUpon closer inspection I determined they all followed a similar structure of one simple English word used as a subdomain to an unrelated second level domain. Below is a sampling to illustrate.\r\n\r\n \taccept.beerandcupcakes[.]com\r\n \tbelief.saltwaterfall[.]com\r\n \tcard.fallingrockfilms[.]com\r\n \tdecision.welcometomydiabeticlife[.]com\r\n \telse.pageinvestmentgroup[.]com\r\n \tfavor.bigislandroofing[.]com\r\n \tglad.justinbieberfannews[.]com\r\n \theart.mkmarketingservices[.]com\r\n \tideal.modularelectronicsystems[.]com\r\n \tjust.eastcoastrandr[.]com\r\n\r\nOut of the over 4,000 sites I further enumerated from PassiveTotal that both follow this naming pattern and had relationships to known landing pages, were 3,000 unique second level domains. I\u2019ll come back to this point later but for now, just know that a majority of them resolved to the IP address \u201c184.168.131[.]24\u201d which is the GoDaddy URL shortening service, similar to \u201cbit.ly\u201d and \u201cgoo.gl\u201d, but allows you to point a DNS A Record to the IP and manage where it will forward the user.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8. GoDaddy URL shortener\/redirector\r\nThe primary difference here is that instead of compromising a WordPress plugin on an unrelated website, as seen in the previous campaigns, they were now using legitimate registrant accounts in a technique called \u201cDomain Shadowing.\u201d Additionally, at the scale I was seeing, it would seem likely that the person(s) behind it were going about it in an automated fashion, logging into these legitimate domain accounts and using a dictionary of simple English words to create subdomains pointing to their redirector.\r\n\r\nThe automated aspect of this can be further evidenced below when you look at the update time for the various domains and cluster them on that facet.\r\n\r\n \tonlinebusinesstrainingacademy[.]org | GoDaddy.com, LLC | 2018-11-12T10:35:19.000-0800\r\n \tonlinebusinesstrainingschool[.]org | GoDaddy.com, LLC | 2018-11-12T10:35:18.000-0800\r\n \tonlinebusinessu[.]org | GoDaddy.com, LLC | 2018-11-12T10:35:18.000-0800\r\n \tonlinejobtrainingacademy[.]com | GoDaddy.com, LLC | 2018-11-12T10:35:18.000-0800\r\n \tonlinejobtrainingschool[.]com | GoDaddy.com, LLC | 2018-11-12T10:35:17.000-0800\r\n \tonlineworktrainingschool[.]com | GoDaddy.com, LLC | 2018-11-12T10:35:18.000-0800\r\n\r\nEach of these domains were created around the same time back in 2016 and visually appear related, even though they all used private registration with GoDaddy. They also all share a last updated WHOIS time within a few seconds of each other and this implies these were updated at the same time, likely because they are all related to the same registrant account.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s not a 1:1 mapping of subdomain to domain and quite a few subdomains are abused in this fashion per second level domain.\r\n\r\n \tadvantage.onlinebusinesstrainingacademy[.]org\r\n \tprinciple.onlinebusinesstrainingacademy[.]org\r\n \tspeak.onlinebusinesstrainingacademy[.]org\r\n \ttext.onlinebusinesstrainingacademy[.]org\r\n \tvenue.onlinebusinesstrainingacademy[.]org\r\n \tchat.onlinebusinesstrainingschool[.]org\r\n \tsale.onlinebusinesstrainingschool[.]org\r\n \tserver.onlinebusinesstrainingschool[.]org\r\n \tstore.onlinebusinesstrainingschool[.]org\r\n \ttitle.onlinebusinesstrainingschool[.]org\r\n \tvalue.onlinebusinesstrainingschool[.]org\r\n \tbrowse.onlinebusinessu[.]org\r\n \tdevelop.onlinebusinessu[.]org\r\n \tdirect.onlinebusinessu[.]org\r\n \testeem.onlinebusinessu[.]org\r\n \tguide.onlinebusinessu[.]org\r\n \tmain.onlinebusinessu[.]org\r\n \tvoice.onlinebusinessu[.]org\r\n \talways.onlinejobtrainingacademy[.]com\r\n \tideal.onlinejobtrainingacademy[.]com\r\n \tmarket.onlinejobtrainingacademy[.]com\r\n \tset.onlinejobtrainingacademy[.]com\r\n \tsmart.onlinejobtrainingacademy[.]com\r\n \tthen.onlinejobtrainingacademy[.]com\r\n \tvenue.onlinejobtrainingacademy[.]com\r\n \tbranch.onlinejobtrainingschool[.]com\r\n \tcard.onlinejobtrainingschool[.]com\r\n \tcheap.onlinejobtrainingschool[.]com\r\n \tgreat.onlinejobtrainingschool[.]com\r\n \tnote.onlinejobtrainingschool[.]com\r\n \tsight.onlinejobtrainingschool[.]com\r\n \tstable.onlinejobtrainingschool[.]com\r\n \tbalance.onlineworktrainingschool[.]com\r\n \tchief.onlineworktrainingschool[.]com\r\n \texpect.onlineworktrainingschool[.]com\r\n \tguide.onlineworktrainingschool[.]com\r\n \tkind.onlineworktrainingschool[.]com\r\n \trefer.onlineworktrainingschool[.]com\r\n \trespect.onlineworktrainingschool[.]com\r\n\r\nAs you can see, this technique gives an attacker a much larger surface area of URLs to use than just compromising an individual website via WordPress plugins.\r\nAffiliates in Crime\r\nWhile looking at these URLs in bulk, one set of artifacts that kept standing out was the naming of the parameters. You have things like \u201cclick_id\u201d, \u201csubid\u201d, \u201cad\u201d, \u201cCID\u201d, etc. These all indicate a tracking system which is typical of affiliate advertising.\r\n\r\nAffiliate advertising, in this context, is a perversion of traditional advertising that incentivizes individuals to aggressively push traffic towards a product by paying for views, clicks, and other activity. Wikipedia provides a slightly more palatable definition:\r\nAffiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing in which a business rewards one or more affiliates for each visitor or customer brought by the affiliate's own marketing efforts.\r\nTechnically, there is nothing wrong with affiliate marketing, but when affiliates use less than scrupulous methods for traffic generation, it puts the onus on the marketing company (merchant and\/or affiliate network) to filter out the bad apples.\r\n\r\nAnother important analytical point is that it is relatively simple to separate out individuals to blame for the illegal activity by having a basic understanding of how affiliate marketing works and analyzing the different styling of the redirections. They are paid by merchants to push traffic, however they can, to these deceptive websites. It\u2019s possible, based on the parameters in use on the landing pages, for the merchant handling these services to track back this illegal activity to their affiliates they are paying and put a stop to it. But more often than not, the merchants themselves are providing the affiliates with the fake celebrity endorsement templates and are just as unscrupulous as the affiliates.\r\n\r\nThe merchants are very aware of who is abusing these systems but are making a profit and as this type of crime is rarely prosecuted, lack significant incentive to police the activity. I observed that victims frequently asked credit card vendors to cancel charges to these merchants and also complained directly to the merchants as well as organizations like the Better Business Bureau\r\nLanding (Pre-Sell\/Farticles) Pages\r\nAfter enumerating out all of the relationships with the compromised servers and hijacked registrant accounts, based on their observed redirection activity in PassiveTotal, I was now left with a large grouping of landing pages to further analyze.\r\n\r\nIn the affiliate marketing community, these types of fake endorsement sites are called \u201cpre-sells\u201d and \u201cfarticles\u201d (yes, farticles\u2026fake articles). The pages intent is clear - get someone to believe the products may actually work if a celebrity endorses it. That\u2019s a tactic as old as advertising itself.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll also find these exact pre-sells being offered to affiliates by the affiliate networks and merchants.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9. Shark Tank pre-sell\r\nAnother interesting thing that I noticed while analyzing these pages is that each of the landing page sites contained other landing pages that I\u2019d seen before, and some which I hadn\u2019t, that were not currently in use. Even when the pages weren\u2019t related to the domain, the templates for these other products still existed on those sites. This, to me, is a clear indication of a bundled package being deployed to the servers and, based on what I saw across multiple affiliate platforms, are typically products provided by the merchants themselves.\r\n\r\nBelow is the \u201cburnfat4tips[.]com\u201d domain illustrating multiple pre-sell pages at different URL paths.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 10. Multiple campaign templates per site\r\nBy enumerating all of the URL paths from the pages submitted by our customers, I was able to identify 26 templates on just this site alone. I\u2019m sure there are even more into which I don\u2019t have visibility.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, these landing pages do nothing more than attempt to elicit a click from the viewer. Every single link, \u201ccontact us\u201d button, Facebook like, Twitter re-tweet, etc all point to the same resource \u2013 another PHP script which handles the redirection to the \u201cmiracle cure\u201d sales page. Even when some of the pre-sell pages are promoting a different product, such as \u201cCLA Safflower Oil\u201d or \u201cTurmeric\u201d, these all eventually redirect to the \u201cPureFit Keto\u201d sales page for this particular campaign.\r\n\r\nGoing back a little, between June 12 \u2013 15 2017, the redirect for the sales page in the Stephen Hawking variant changed their PHP file from this format:\r\ntogo.php?lnk=7e7525addd988e89&amp;a=aER5clJOVnFSWGVFYjY4bW5DMkEyUmN3a3ZtRUxvUGYyck9FTFM3UTRKV1d6d0FsNmZuSWNGd1o2blp5UjFQWXc5ZktxNndJTGZXTFRYS2tVZnk1SngrUFlnQnRjdjVtSzUzYUdKY0cvdjN6Qk9WbDdFT0hyZ2lPVkJkTUhtS1dCNnJJTHdwaERuNzhPT25VMzdxbHlRPT0=\r\nTo this format which is the same as the other landing pages currently in use:\r\ngo.php?CID=416071&amp;bhu=spctECr16tLfm14ZpdEZurodvXKKKLDhqn5feD\r\nThis could indicate a change in affiliate networks or a change in the way the affiliate network handles their tracking. While unraveling all of these threads, I stumbled upon an entirely separate industry for just this aspect of affiliate marketing and from what I observed, it was just as equally shady.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cCID\u201d here in the last example is likely used to represent \u201cCustomer ID\u201d for the affiliate tracking and could prove useful for mapping actors out, even if we don\u2019t know who it actually is. From the 575 sites that I was able to get the source HTML for, there were four CID\u2019s in use across the campaigns spanning 2 years.\r\n\r\n \t411308\r\n \t414300\r\n \t414752\r\n \t416071\r\n\r\nSales Pages\r\nThe sales pages weren\u2019t initially interesting to me given that the illegal activity seems focused in the affiliate arena, but that changed fairly quickly when I began trying to understand more about the core workings of the campaigns.\r\n\r\nFor the \u201cPureFit Keto\u201d product, you\u2019ll be presented with a page that looks like the below.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 11. PureFit Keto sales page\r\nOn the surface, it\u2019s pretty straight forward. Lots of meaningless slogans and visual alert cues to try and persuade you into giving them money and buying the pills.\r\n\r\nAfter being sent the CaesarV article previously mentioned, I wondered if there were other blogs or posts about these campaigns that could shed more light on the situation.\r\n\r\nBack in 2016 MalwarebytesLabs researcher Jovi Umawing released an article about the Stephen Hawking page selling \u201cInteligen\u201d (the miracle brain formula). One thing that caught my eye here was the sales page for this product.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 12. Inteligen sales page\r\nIt looks very familiar. The three checks, a pill bottle, the input dialog, \u201crush my order\u201d, etc. Given their penchant for templates, I wondered if other sites were the same.\r\n\r\nOf course, not too long after, I found other articles from Jovi dating all the way back to 2014. In both, there is a TMZ page selling a weight loss product called \u201cGarcinia Cambogia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 13. TMZ pre-sell page\r\nThis was coupled with other screenshots Jovi provided for the sales pages that users were redirected to when clicking on any of the links.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 14. Garcinia Cambogia sales page variant 1\r\nAlong with\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 15. Garcinia Cambogia sales page variant 2\r\nAgain, having them lined up next to each other helps to illustrate the obvious template being used when building these sales page. All the way down to the \u201cIN STOCK\u201d warning banners across the top that can be seen on the most recent \u201cPureFit Keto\u201d site. It also shows that, for at least 4 years now, they\u2019ve been creating the templates in parallel to the fake celebrity endorsement pre-sell sites.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing a few more articles I found regarding these campaigns, with the earliest dating back to mid-2013, I began to look at the actual sales page URLs and corresponding meta-data to see if anything stood out.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that in this chain of events, the \u201caffiliates\u201d are the individuals pushing the initial enticements, such as the e-mail spam. There is a demarcation that occurs in affiliate marketing at the point of the sales pages which appear to be run by the \u201cmerchants\u201d who sell the products and provide the pre-sell pages for affiliates to use.\r\n\r\nThey, of course, can be one in the same person but I wanted to try and understand the other side of the fence since they are so entwined with the deceptive marketing side of the campaign.\r\n\r\nLooking at the sites from the campaigns I was observing, both \u201cinteligen[.]org\u201d and \u201cpurefitketo[.]net\u201d didn\u2019t provide anything of note; however, the site, \u201cnaturalgarciniacambogia[.]net\u201d, from Jovi\u2019s blog over at MalwareBytes did.\r\n\r\nBack on January 22 2016, about 6 days before removing their details, a WHOIS record revealed the name, e-mail, and organization which registered that particular domain.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 16. WHOIS for \"naturalgarciniacambogia[.]net\"\r\n\r\nJJR Media\r\nTo kick things off, I did a quick Google search for the \u201cJJR Media\u201d organization and immediately found its website, with plenty of examples on display of their sales pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 17. JJR media website\r\nThey have multiple products listed, all with similar templates, and even a slightly modernized version of their older Garcinia sales page.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 18. Updated Garcinia sales page\r\nOf course, two hits on Google below the one for their main website you find one for the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and complaints against the \u201cnaturalgarciniacambogia[.]net\u201d website. It provides more details on the actual business organization behind the web site, which I was surprised to find was incorporated. I\u2019ve since learned that one of the driving factors that these affiliate marketers have in incorporating their businesses is so they, the individual, cannot be held personally liable when people start going after them for fraud and the like.\r\n\r\nThese websites are hosted alongside an affiliate marketing network for a business called \u201cExpress Revenue Inc.\u201d, which, if you pivot further on the domains hosted by these organizations, you can see multiple sales pages like the ones discussed in this blog.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 19. JJR Media passive nameserver\r\nFocusing on the website \u201ccbdlifereview[.]com\u201d, which appears as though it is still being setup, it exposes an open directory of folders on the website.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 20. Index of \"cbdlifereview[.]com\"\r\nEach of these \u201clp\u201d (landing pages) are the exact same deceptive pre-sell pages as described above by the FTC.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 21. Jacobs CBD pre-sell pages\r\nAdditionally, the below image shows an affiliate \u201coffer\u201d site, wherein we can see that Express Revenue is offering to affiliates the Shark Tank pre-sell pages from advertiser \u201cSLA Slim Quick\u201d for campaigns.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 22. Express Revenue Shark Tank\r\n\r\nThe FTC, Oprah, Dr. Oz, and NBC\r\nAffiliate marketing scams like this are not new. Back in 2009, Oprah and Dr. Oz filed a lawsuit against hundreds of affiliates using the same type of \u201cpre-sell\u201d deceptive celebrity endorsement pages, which made national headlines. By 2014, the FTC was dragged front and center because of these fraudulent campaigns. There were literally thousands of these sites and affiliates, but I think it\u2019s clear that the work done back this has done little to curb this still rampant activity.\r\n\r\nFrom the FTC\u2019s website on the event:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\u201cNot only did these defendants trick consumers with their phony weight loss claims, they also compounded the deception by advertising on pretend news sites, making it impossible for people to know whether they were seeing news or an ad,\u201d said Jessica Rich, Director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection.\r\nAs I was investigating all of these campaigns, I shared frequent screenshots and updates of interesting tidbits with the rest of my team. A funny thing happened a few months ago when one of them was watching the Today show on NBC, who is the current pre-sell flavor of the week, and they ran a segment on this exact campaign. My colleague sent me a link to the video and in turn, an article they published about it.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the sales page was trying to sell a skin care product called \u201cLiva Derma Serum\u201d and it was brought to the attention of the shows frontrunner by a fan asking if it was real, and subsequently investigated by Gadi Schwartz and Lindsey Bomnin.\r\n\r\nNow, before we continue on with this exploration, the next term we need to learn is \u201cre-bill\u201d and how it\u2019s abused in this industry as a mechanism to scam people. That\u2019s effectively what all of these campaigns are and, based on reading discussions in affiliate marketing communities, it\u2019s one of the bigger cash cows.\r\nAnother Bill, Sir?\r\nAfter you\u2019ve lured the victim to your website, in tiny fine print that will never be seen, you include a line that says \u201cif you don\u2019t cancel your subscription within X days then you\u2019ll be billed an absorbent amount of money on a reoccurring basis until you cancel.\u201d You entice them with free products, or a trial run, to get your hooks in and then after they cover the initial cost of shipping, you slap them with large charges directly to their credit cards which may go unseen for multiple billing cycles.\r\n\r\nHopefully someone notices before it\u2019s too late but more often than not, at least one cycle goes through and the merchants laugh all the way to the bank. At some point in the past, seemingly all of the affiliate marketing scams basically switched to this scheme because the payouts are bigger and there may be some legal wiggle-room due to that fine print. Every campaign described in this blog is a re-bill scam. Heck, even the affiliates know it\u2019s unscrupulous but, as \u201cbprimeelite\u201d so tastefully stated: \u201cin this world you either have to be the wolf or the sheep\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 23. Re-bill scam acknowledgement\r\nTo recap then \u2013\r\n\r\n \tYou have affiliates who spam links to get people to the pre-sell\/landing pages and get paid a small amount of money for every user who successfully submits a valid credit card.\r\n \tYou have \u201cmerchants\u201d who run the re-bill scheme and potentially make $50-$100 per surprise credit card billing.\r\n \tYou have an affiliate network which connects the merchants to the affiliates and acts as an intermediary who gets a piece of the pie from the merchants.\r\n\r\nLooking at the Better Business Bureau\u2019s (BBB) website provides a wealth of information on these affiliate networks and merchant businesses. It\u2019s not uncommon to see warning like this for consumers:\r\nBBB files indicate that this business has a pattern of complaints concerning: business not refunding the costumer and continued billing without customers knowledge. On July 7, 2014, the BBB sent a request to the business to address this pattern and what actions the business has taken to help eliminate the causes of complaints.\r\nThese BBB complaints highlight the \u201cre-bill\u201d scam in full effect.\r\n01\/13\/2017\r\nI signed up for a trial offer and they tried to charge my account $120 at two separate times. Notice this morning on January 13th 2017 that my account had been charged for $90 from this company. Then I proceeded to call the company and tell them that I had signed up for the trial that they had going on for $4.95.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n12\/12\/2016\r\nThis company operates with deceitful business practices. They offer you a \"free\" product. You only have to pay minimal shipping. The free product enrolls you in an auto refill system and if you do not cancel your membership (that you are unaware you have) within 14 days you are charged $89.99 a month for additional product. On top of the hassle of unwittingly being charged for it, THEIR PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK!!\r\n09\/13\/2016\r\nI thought this was free, only had to pay 4.94 for shipping. I feel I was mislead.They have charged my account 89.99 for one bottle.Their advertising I received email saying free products of your choosing, all you had to do was pay for shipping.\r\nAll of this is allowed by the following line in the terms of service on the sales pages after you click a tiny link towards the bottom of the page.\r\nI UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CONSUMER TRANSACTION INVOLVES A NEGATIVE OPTION AND THAT I MAY BE LIABLE FOR PAYMENT OF FUTURE GOODS AND SERVICES, UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, IF I FAIL TO NOTIFY THE Garcinia Active Slim NOT TO SUPPLY THE PRODUCTS DESCRIBED. BY PLACING MY ORDER, I PROVIDE MY ELECTRONIC AUTHORIZATION FOR FUTURE CHARGES AGAINST MY CREDIT CARD UNLESS I CANCEL. IN ADDITION, YOU DO NOT HOLD Garcinia Active Slim RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OVERDRAFT CHARGES OR FEES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR DURING THE ONGOING AUTO-SHIP PROGRAM.\r\n\r\nTakedown Cures\r\nThis brings us to the question of \u201cwhat can be done about it?\u201d and unfortunately, the reality is there isn\u2019t much beyond education, which this blog attempts to provide to the reader.\r\n\r\nThe FTC is aware and the celebrities and organizations being used are aware with some having taken legal action, but it still remains as problematic as ever - so what else can be done?\r\n\r\nWell, as part of this research and data collection, after identifying a reoccurring pattern of abuse of GoDaddy services, I reached out to their Threat Intelligence team to see if we couldn\u2019t tackle at least one aspect of these campaigns and hinder the perpetuation of the scams.\r\n\r\nAfter writing some new scripts to automate and collect shadow domains for these campaigns and working with GoDaddy\u2019s abuse teams, we were able to successfully identify and shut down over 15,000 subdomain being used across these campaigns.\r\n\r\nBased on what we know from the dozens of publicly available \u201cbit.ly\u201d and \u201cgoo.gl\u201d statistics of the initial URLs being spammed out to our customers, we are able to glean a little insight into the potential disruption this shutdown may have. On average, primarily with viewers from the United States of America, the links were each clicked 273 times. If even a fraction of the 15,000 plus subdomains received that many clicks per site, then it removed millions of potential targets these actors could prey upon.\r\n\r\nA big win for everyone involved that will go a long way in protecting consumers.\r\nConclusion\r\nThroughout this blog, I\u2019ve tried to stress the importance of patterns at every phase of analysis to establish the behaviors for how these affiliates, networks, and merchants operate. The Internet has proved to be a breeding ground for nefarious activity and with so many moving parts, it constantly makes attribution and accountability more complicated.\r\n\r\nWhile pouring over the forums, both private and public, for these affiliate marketers, you find that they are all very aware of the fraud that is rampant in their industry. In a lot of cases, they are even openly flaunting their \u201cblack hat\u201d activities. They know that due to the anonymous nature of the Internet, the difficulty that the U.S. Government has faced when trying to prosecute these crimes, and how easy it has become to blend into the every-day background noise, there appears to be little risk to them for continuing with these scams.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s unfortunate to see how pervasive this advertising industry has become and it doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing down anytime soon as long as the money keeps flowing in.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of players in the affiliate marketing world, from the affiliates to the merchants and all of the networks in-between. Hopefully this blog helps to shine some light on how at every link in this chain there are shady, sometimes illegal, and almost always deceptive, business practices still being employed to scam hard working people out of their money.","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@id":"#panworg"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"","width":"","height":""},"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Jeff White"}]}</script><link rel='stylesheet' id='crayon-css'  href='https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/plugins/crayon-syntax-highlighter/css/min/crayon.min.css?ver=_2.7.2_beta' type='text/css' media='all' />

<p>At Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 analyzes threats across the spectrum – from nation state all the way down to Florida state. In this blog, I’ll be covering two aspects of multi-year affiliate marketing spam campaigns designed to deceive individuals, scam, and profit off of people’s desire to change their lives.</p>
<p>First, I’ll provide an overview of a spam campaign sent to some customers that led me down this more than two year rabbit hole, and then dig into the inner workings. This blog covers a number of topics: data collection, analysis, and enumeration of infrastructure. These efforts allowed us to map out thousands of compromised servers and abused domains and hundreds of compromised accounts, resulting in a collaborative effort with GoDaddy to take down over 15,000 subdomains being used across these campaigns.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>On a scale of 1 to 10 for the “Worst Types of Spam” you can receive, approaching that perfect 10 score is spam related to “snake oil” products that are so patently fake that you struggle to understand why they would even bother trying to sell it. You know the ones I’m talking about. The late night, 3A.M. insomnia, as-seen-on-TV, “miracle” products that use laughably bad actors to try and sell you laughably bad products…for a limited time only!</p>
<p>At some point the 3A.M. commercials of yesteryear became all-day e-mails, social media posts, and other forms of invasive advertising that have weaseled their way into our daily lives. So much so that sometimes they just begin to blend into the minutiae of things bombarding us constantly and become part of our expected usage experience; we begin to just glaze over them without giving them a second thought. That’s exactly what was happening to me for a particular campaign of spam that I was seeing every now and then but didn’t give much thought to. It went on for over two years and I began noticing slight variations every month until something clicked and what once was background noise now was something of interest.</p>
<p>At first it’s easy to look past them – “Ah! Just another weight loss pill” or “Yes! I’m sure this totally legit Canadian pharmacy has you covered for pain medications.” However, as I began to notice a pattern in the visual structure across some of these spam websites it piqued my interest. Over two years I had watched some of these sites and could identify a template being used that slowly morphed over time, selling different products, and always using different URLs to mask their intentions, but visually appearing quite similar.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ll recognize one of them if you’ve ever been adventurous enough to see where a random link in an e-mail would take you.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 1. Deceptive scam pages</span></em></p>
<p>At times, it was clear, based on domains like <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">“keywestinns[.]com”</span>, that there was something a little more nefarious going on. When I started to investigate, I was seeing hundreds of different domains, with lots of them showing signs of compromise, and quite clearly NOT intended for the spam being used on their infrastructure.</p>
<p>When the act of sending unsolicited offers crosses the line from annoyance to dabbling in illegal acts, then the everyday spam becomes a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>And with that dear readers, it’s time to gather around the camp fire as we go down some rabbit holes on a journey of exploration into the magical mystical world of affiliate marketing spam.</p>
<h2>Initial Patterns of Shadiness</h2>
<p>To begin, I feel it’s best to highlight some of the spam that initially piqued my interest.</p>
<p>Starting in early 2017, I began making a mental note of these sites purporting celebrity endorsements for weight loss and “brain enhancement” pills. In our process of analysis, we’re presented with an array of screenshots from the virtual systems that crawl these websites; this is why after seeing these images time and time again they eventually became ingrained in my mind and I could start to recognize templates being used and their slight variations over time.</p>
<p>Thus, I present to you some of the first campaigns that I observed throughout 2017. Note the structural similarities as I go through them.</p>
<p>Style A) “Stephen Hawking Predicts, ‘This Pill Will Change Humanity’”</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-2-Stephen-Hawking-variant.jpg" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-96773 size-full" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-2-Stephen-Hawking-variant.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-2-Stephen-Hawking-variant.jpg 1024w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-2-Stephen-Hawking-variant-900x675.jpg 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-2-Stephen-Hawking-variant-300x225.jpg 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-2-Stephen-Hawking-variant-768x576.jpg 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-2-Stephen-Hawking-variant-370x278.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Figure 2. Stephen Hawking variant</em></span></p>
<p>A lofty claim for sure and who wouldn’t believe what Stephen Hawking says to Wolf Blitzer as reported on Forbes? While this campaign phased out, there was another running in parallel with the same tactics but a different product, switching from “brain supplements” to “weight loss.” It keeps the celebrity endorsement theme and continues masquerading as a legitimate website.</p>
<p>Style B) “Gwen Stefani Shares Blake Shelton’s Secret To Rapid Weight Loss”</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-3-Gwen-Stefani-variant.jpg" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-96774 size-full" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-3-Gwen-Stefani-variant.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-3-Gwen-Stefani-variant.jpg 1024w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-3-Gwen-Stefani-variant-900x675.jpg 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-3-Gwen-Stefani-variant-300x225.jpg 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-3-Gwen-Stefani-variant-768x576.jpg 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-3-Gwen-Stefani-variant-370x278.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 3. Gwen Stefani variant</span></em></p>
<p>I’ll touch on the domains in a minute but note that this domain is crafted specifically for this fake endorsement. It masquerades as the legitimate “TMZ” website with a domain using the brand in the name &#8211; <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">“weightloss4tmz[.]com”</span>.</p>
<p>After these two died off, two new campaigns began popping-up around early-2018 and are still active as of today.</p>
<p>Style C) “Why Every Judge On Shark Tank Backed This Product from” – Lacey Brown</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-4-Shark-Tank-variant-1.jpg" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-96775 size-full" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-4-Shark-Tank-variant-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-4-Shark-Tank-variant-1.jpg 1024w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-4-Shark-Tank-variant-1-900x675.jpg 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-4-Shark-Tank-variant-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-4-Shark-Tank-variant-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-4-Shark-Tank-variant-1-370x278.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>

<p>When you see them next to each other, the templates become more apparent in the stylization of their structured layouts.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the URLs on display in the above screenshots are not what the initial phishing URL looks like, but they are where you eventually end up after, sometimes, 3-4 redirects away from their point of origin. When I finally decided to do some research on these campaigns and figure out what was going on, this detail made initial identification a bit trickier.</p>
<p>Below is a table showing the original URLs and the domains where they ended up in the four images above.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Table 1. Redirection URL per variant</em></span></p>
<p>As I started to manually sift through the URLs I processed, looking for past samples to collect from each campaign, I noticed an interesting pattern that spanned across the URLs going back years. Specifically, the initial redirection page was commonly using a PHP file with a single parameter that was typically a simple English word followed by a mix of alphanumeric characters. It was enough to create a regular expression and match additional sites but I kept finding outliers where it wasn’t always consistent, such as in the above SharkTankV1 sample, and I needed to find a way to collect more holistic data.</p>
<p>I needed a way of identifying all of the campaign variants we’d seen over the past few years without relying on the initial URL from the phishing email. A tricky problem to be sure. In addition, I still wanted to identify the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">“bit[.]ly”</span> and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">“goo[.]gl”</span> type shortening services, the redirectors, and in some cases the landing pages to see if any patterns appeared &#8211; basically, whatever a potential victim saw. Thus, the only consistent piece of the puzzle I had at that point were the images from our virtual systems used for analysis, so I decided to start from there and work my way backwards.</p>
<h2>Spam Cartography</h2>
<p>I reviewed a number of methodologies on image comparison and settled on Mean Squared Error (MSE). This technique essentially generates a measurement score based on the average of the squares of errors, or in this context the difference between pixel intensity of the two compared images. As every screenshot was of the same size and general layout within the virtual machine, this relatively simple method proved quite accurate at scale.</p>
<p>Using this <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/09/15/python-compare-two-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fabulous blog</a> I cobbled together a Python script that iterated over 42,000 images from our virtual systems where URLs were sent for manual analysis. I did this for each campaign “style” and reported back matches that I then could use to walk back to the submitted URL, after which I manually scraped out the landing page URLs.</p>
<p>Below are some statistics on how many unique sites and domains were collected following this methodology.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Table 2. Campaign variant statistics</span></em></p>
<p>One thing that was immediately surprising to me was the sheer number of unique, purchased landing page domains used for these campaigns.</p>
<p>With a sizable corpus of samples from each campaign, I began looking at them deeper to understand how the flow of events occurred and to try and answer the question: how does one actually land on any of these pages?</p>
<p>After speaking with some of our customers, hunting for various URLs, and reviewing quite a few other research blogs, I was able to put together a pretty clear chain of events.</p>
<ul>
<li>User clicks a link from spam e-mails, random/hijacked Skype messages, Facebook ads, and Twitter posts.</li>
<li>User ends up on a redirection site, which were usually legitimate sites compromised in some way, which may involve a few hops.</li>
<li>User ends up on a fake celebrity endorsement landing page.</li>
<li>User ends up ultimately on a sales page for the product being sold.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 6 shows an in-the-wild example that maps out each step:</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-6-Chain-of-events-from-original-source-to-destination.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-96777 size-full" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-6-Chain-of-events-from-original-source-to-destination.png" alt="" width="907" height="752" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-6-Chain-of-events-from-original-source-to-destination.png 907w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-6-Chain-of-events-from-original-source-to-destination-900x746.png 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-6-Chain-of-events-from-original-source-to-destination-300x249.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-6-Chain-of-events-from-original-source-to-destination-768x637.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-6-Chain-of-events-from-original-source-to-destination-370x307.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 6. Chain of events from original source to destination</span></em></p>
<p>Starting with the compromised site portion of the chain seemed like an ideal choice to focus on but I could tell from the samples I’d already collected that not all of them used the PHP file for redirection. In fact, as I started to look at each of the campaigns and chains in more detail, I identified multiple styles in how the redirection was occurring at this phase.</p>
<p>Using RiskIQ’s PassiveTotal service to pivot on sites that redirected to or from the compromised sites, I was able to map out 689 landing pages that mapped back to a whopping 21,611 potentially compromised websites. I thought that was quite an extensive network for trying to push fake products so I continued digging.</p>
<p>While looking at some of the metadata for the compromised sites, I stumbled across a tag in PassiveTotal created by one of their security researchers, Jordan Herman, called “CaesarV”. The description of their tag lined up perfectly with some of the activity I was seeing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">The CaesarV injection is using .php files on compromised site to drive traffic to fraudulent and/or scam pages including fake tech support and fake sites purporting to be news sites reporting on the incredible effects of weightloss and intelligence pills. It is unclear whether it is also sending traffic malware at this time. The injection uses a Caesar cipher to obfuscate the method of redirection and the address to which traffic is being sent. This campaign appears to be long running, at least since the beginning of 2017 and possibly much longer.</span></p>
<p>Jordan sent me  a <a href="https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/caesarv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link to a September 2017 blog</a> PassiveTotal released which featured the Stephen Hawking campaign shown in Figure 2). It detailed how the spammers were able to get access to one of the compromised servers and analyzed the PHP file handling the redirection.</p>
<p>Of note was the use of a Caesar cipher to unmask the hardcoded landing pages to which potential victims would be redirected.</p>
<p>I’ll briefly illustrate this style before covering the additional ones that I saw across my sample set.</p>
<h2>Traffic Redirection Styling</h2>
<h3>CaesarV</h3>
<p>For the CaesarV style, at the bottom of the redirect page there is JavaScript block that contains something like the below.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">pursuea=24; pursueb=[128,140,140,136,82,71,71,136,138,135,124,141,123,140,76,124,129,125,140,70,143,135,138,132,124,71,87,121,85,76,73,79,79,78,80,62,123,85,123,136,123,124,129,125,140,62,139,85,75,77,79,78,77]; pursuec=&#8221;&#8221;; for(pursued=0;pursued&lt;pursueb.length;pursued++) { pursuec+=String.fromCharCode(pursueb[pursued]-pursuea); } window.top.location.href=pursuec;</span></p>
<p>It’s just a basic array of integers, shifted in this case by “24”, that represent the ASCII characters which make up the URL.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [128,140,140,136,82,71,71,136,138,135,124,141,123,140,76,124,129,125,140,70,143,135,138,132,124,71,87,121,85,76,73,79,79,78,80,62,123,85,123,136,123,124,129,125,140,62,139,85,75,77,79,78,77]</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">&gt;&gt;&gt; &#8220;&#8221;.join([chr(x &#8211; 24) for x in a])</span></p>

<h3>JavaScript Variant 2</h3>
<p>Another JavaScript variant that I frequently saw used a simple string ordering obfuscation to hide the URL before it rebuilds it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">var kbgo361 = &#8216;h&#8217;;</span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">if (rdzvxyaxbo26 = &#8216;xoa139&#8217;) {   </span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">}</span></p>
<p>This redirects the browser to a PHP file on a landing page server:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">https://fastdiet-lines[.]com/held.php?a=1kBJ&amp;c=diet&amp;s=10058</span></p>
<p>Then this site uses a 303 “See Other” HTTP request to redirect to the final landing page. It’s worth noting at this point the parameters “a” (Affiliate), “c” (Campaign), and “s” (Sub) that are included in the above request.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">https://fastdiet-lines[.]com/us/wykc/keto-all-desktop3?bhu=spctECr16tLfm14ZpdEZun3r45xPcSviq2L12u</span></p>
<h3>3XX Redirect Chain</h3>
<p>The last dominant style I’ll cover is a chaining of HTTP 3XX Redirection requests as illustrated in the example below.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-7-3XX-Redirection-chain.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-96778 size-full" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-7-3XX-Redirection-chain.png" alt="" width="907" height="1175" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-7-3XX-Redirection-chain.png 907w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-7-3XX-Redirection-chain-900x1166.png 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-7-3XX-Redirection-chain-232x300.png 232w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-7-3XX-Redirection-chain-768x995.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-7-3XX-Redirection-chain-790x1024.png 790w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-7-3XX-Redirection-chain-370x479.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Figure 7. 3XX Redirection chain</em></span></p>
<p>As an aside, all of the certificates I observed across these campaigns when HTTPS was used were issued by “Let’s Encrypt”, which offers free and automated certificate creation quite commonly abused by malicious actors.</p>
<p>While collecting these URLs, the 3XX style of redirection illuminated another area of clearly illegal activity. Over the past few months, I noticed a large influx in this style of redirect being pushed out and hitting my radar. While speaking with one of our customers to understand where they were receiving the initial URL’s from, they sent me some of the “hundreds” of e-mails they were receiving leading to these campaigns.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection I determined they all followed a similar structure of one simple English word used as a subdomain to an unrelated second level domain. Below is a sampling to illustrate.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">accept.beerandcupcakes[.]com</span></li>

</ul>
<p>Out of the over 4,000 sites I further enumerated from PassiveTotal that both follow this naming pattern and had relationships to known landing pages, were 3,000 unique second level domains. I’ll come back to this point later but for now, just know that a majority of them resolved to the IP address “184.168.131[.]24” which is the GoDaddy URL shortening service, similar to “bit.ly” and “goo.gl”, but allows you to point a DNS A Record to the IP and manage where it will forward the user.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-8-GoDaddy-URL-shortener-redirector.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-96779 size-full" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-8-GoDaddy-URL-shortener-redirector.png" alt="" width="909" height="378" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-8-GoDaddy-URL-shortener-redirector.png 909w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-8-GoDaddy-URL-shortener-redirector-900x374.png 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-8-GoDaddy-URL-shortener-redirector-300x125.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-8-GoDaddy-URL-shortener-redirector-768x319.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-8-GoDaddy-URL-shortener-redirector-370x154.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 909px) 100vw, 909px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Figure 8. GoDaddy URL shortener/redirector</em></span></p>
<p>The primary difference here is that instead of compromising a WordPress plugin on an unrelated website, as seen in the previous campaigns, they were now using legitimate registrant accounts in a technique called “<a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/angler-domain-shadowing#shadowing">Domain Shadowing</a>.” Additionally, at the scale I was seeing, it would seem likely that the person(s) behind it were going about it in an automated fashion, logging into these legitimate domain accounts and using a dictionary of simple English words to create subdomains pointing to their redirector.</p>
<p>The automated aspect of this can be further evidenced below when you look at the update time for the various domains and cluster them on that facet.</p>

<p>Each of these domains were created around the same time back in 2016 and visually appear related, even though they all used private registration with GoDaddy. They also all share a last updated WHOIS time within a few seconds of each other and this implies these were updated at the same time, likely because they are all related to the same registrant account.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you’ll find that it’s not a 1:1 mapping of subdomain to domain and quite a few subdomains are abused in this fashion per second level domain.</p>

<p>As you can see, this technique gives an attacker a much larger surface area of URLs to use than just compromising an individual website via WordPress plugins.</p>
<h2>Affiliates in Crime</h2>
<p>While looking at these URLs in bulk, one set of artifacts that kept standing out was the naming of the parameters. You have things like “click_id”, “subid”, “ad”, “CID”, etc. These all indicate a tracking system which is typical of affiliate advertising.</p>
<p>Affiliate advertising, in this context, is a perversion of traditional advertising that incentivizes individuals to aggressively push traffic towards a product by paying for views, clicks, and other activity. Wikipedia provides a slightly more palatable definition:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Affiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing in which a business rewards one or more affiliates for each visitor or customer brought by the affiliate&#8217;s own marketing efforts.</span></p>
<p>Technically, there is nothing wrong with affiliate marketing, but when affiliates use less than scrupulous methods for traffic generation, it puts the onus on the marketing company (merchant and/or affiliate network) to filter out the bad apples.</p>
<p>Another important analytical point is that it is relatively simple to separate out individuals to blame for the illegal activity by having a basic understanding of how affiliate marketing works and analyzing the different styling of the redirections. They are paid by merchants to push traffic, however they can, to these deceptive websites. It’s possible, based on the parameters in use on the landing pages, for the merchant handling these services to track back this illegal activity to their affiliates they are paying and put a stop to it. But more often than not, the merchants themselves are providing the affiliates with the fake celebrity endorsement templates and are just as unscrupulous as the affiliates.</p>
<p>The merchants are very aware of who is abusing these systems but are making a profit and as this type of crime is rarely prosecuted, lack significant incentive to police the activity. I observed that victims frequently asked credit card vendors to cancel charges to these merchants and also complained directly to the merchants as well as organizations like the Better Business Bureau</p>
<h2>Landing (Pre-Sell/Farticles) Pages</h2>
<p>After enumerating out all of the relationships with the compromised servers and hijacked registrant accounts, based on their observed redirection activity in PassiveTotal, I was now left with a large grouping of landing pages to further analyze.</p>
<p>In the affiliate marketing community, these types of fake endorsement sites are called “pre-sells” and “farticles” (yes, farticles…fake articles). The pages intent is clear &#8211; get someone to believe the products may actually work if a celebrity endorses it. That’s a tactic as old as advertising itself.</p>
<p>You’ll also find these exact pre-sells being offered to affiliates by the affiliate networks and merchants.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-9-Shark-Tank-pre-sell.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-96780 size-full" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-9-Shark-Tank-pre-sell.png" alt="" width="1105" height="496" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-9-Shark-Tank-pre-sell.png 1105w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-9-Shark-Tank-pre-sell-900x404.png 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-9-Shark-Tank-pre-sell-300x135.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-9-Shark-Tank-pre-sell-768x345.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-9-Shark-Tank-pre-sell-1024x460.png 1024w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-9-Shark-Tank-pre-sell-370x166.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 1105px) 100vw, 1105px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Figure 9. Shark Tank pre-sell</em></span></p>
<p>Another interesting thing that I noticed while analyzing these pages is that each of the landing page sites contained other landing pages that I’d seen before, and some which I hadn’t, that were not currently in use. Even when the pages weren’t related to the domain, the templates for these other products still existed on those sites. This, to me, is a clear indication of a bundled package being deployed to the servers and, based on what I saw across multiple affiliate platforms, are typically products provided by the merchants themselves.</p>
<p>Below is the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">“burnfat4tips[.]com”</span> domain illustrating multiple pre-sell pages at different URL paths.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-10-Multiple-campaign-templates-per-site.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-96781 size-full" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-10-Multiple-campaign-templates-per-site.png" alt="" width="1680" height="1002" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-10-Multiple-campaign-templates-per-site.png 1680w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-10-Multiple-campaign-templates-per-site-900x537.png 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-10-Multiple-campaign-templates-per-site-300x179.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-10-Multiple-campaign-templates-per-site-768x458.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-10-Multiple-campaign-templates-per-site-1024x611.png 1024w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-10-Multiple-campaign-templates-per-site-370x221.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Figure 10. Multiple campaign templates per site</em></span></p>
<p>By enumerating all of the URL paths from the pages submitted by our customers, I was able to identify 26 templates on just this site alone. I’m sure there are even more into which I don’t have visibility.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, these landing pages do nothing more than attempt to elicit a click from the viewer. Every single link, “contact us” button, Facebook like, Twitter re-tweet, etc all point to the same resource – another PHP script which handles the redirection to the “miracle cure” sales page. Even when some of the pre-sell pages are promoting a different product, such as “CLA Safflower Oil” or “Turmeric”, these all eventually redirect to the “PureFit Keto” sales page for this particular campaign.</p>
<p>Going back a little, between June 12 – 15 2017, the redirect for the sales page in the Stephen Hawking variant changed their PHP file from this format:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">togo.php?lnk=7e7525addd988e89&amp;a=aER5clJOVnFSWGVFYjY4bW5DMkEyUmN3a3ZtRUxvUGYyck9FTFM3UTRKV1d6d0FsNmZuSWNGd1o2blp5UjFQWXc5ZktxNndJTGZXTFRYS2tVZnk1SngrUFlnQnRjdjVtSzUzYUdKY0cvdjN6Qk9WbDdFT0hyZ2lPVkJkTUhtS1dCNnJJTHdwaERuNzhPT25VMzdxbHlRPT0=</span></p>
<p>To this format which is the same as the other landing pages currently in use:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">go.php?CID=416071&amp;bhu=spctECr16tLfm14ZpdEZurodvXKKKLDhqn5feD</span></p>
<p>This could indicate a change in affiliate networks or a change in the way the affiliate network handles their tracking. While unraveling all of these threads, I stumbled upon an entirely separate industry for just this aspect of affiliate marketing and from what I observed, it was just as equally shady.</p>
<p>The “CID” here in the last example is likely used to represent “Customer ID” for the affiliate tracking and could prove useful for mapping actors out, even if we don’t know who it actually is. From the 575 sites that I was able to get the source HTML for, there were four CID’s in use across the campaigns spanning 2 years.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">411308</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">414300</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">414752</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">416071</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sales Pages</h2>
<p>The sales pages weren’t initially interesting to me given that the illegal activity seems focused in the affiliate arena, but that changed fairly quickly when I began trying to understand more about the core workings of the campaigns.</p>
<p>For the “PureFit Keto” product, you’ll be presented with a page that looks like the below.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-11-PureFit-Keto-sales-page.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-96782 size-full" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-11-PureFit-Keto-sales-page.png" alt="" width="1467" height="945" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-11-PureFit-Keto-sales-page.png 1467w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-11-PureFit-Keto-sales-page-900x580.png 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-11-PureFit-Keto-sales-page-300x193.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-11-PureFit-Keto-sales-page-768x495.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-11-PureFit-Keto-sales-page-1024x660.png 1024w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-11-PureFit-Keto-sales-page-370x238.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 1467px) 100vw, 1467px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Figure 11. PureFit Keto sales page</em></span></p>
<p>On the surface, it’s pretty straight forward. Lots of meaningless slogans and visual alert cues to try and persuade you into giving them money and buying the pills.</p>
<p>After being sent the <a href="https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/caesarv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CaesarV</a> article previously mentioned, I wondered if there were other blogs or posts about these campaigns that could shed more light on the situation.</p>
<p>Back in 2016 MalwarebytesLabs researcher Jovi Umawing released an <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2016/12/fake-forbes-story-becomes-bearer-of-smart-drug-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> about the Stephen Hawking page selling “Inteligen” (the miracle brain formula). One thing that caught my eye here was the sales page for this product.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-12-Inteligen-sales-page.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-96783 size-full" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-12-Inteligen-sales-page.png" alt="" width="830" height="480" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-12-Inteligen-sales-page.png 830w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-12-Inteligen-sales-page-300x173.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-12-Inteligen-sales-page-768x444.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-12-Inteligen-sales-page-370x214.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 830px) 100vw, 830px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 12. Inteligen sales page</span></em></p>
<p>It looks very familiar. The three checks, a pill bottle, the input dialog, “rush my order”, etc. Given their penchant for templates, I wondered if other sites were the same.</p>
<p>Of course, not too long after, I found <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2014/12/known-diet-scam-targets-philippine-buyers-on-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other</a> <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2014/06/advisory-seasonal-scam-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">articles</a> from Jovi dating all the way back to 2014. In both, there is a TMZ page selling a weight loss product called “Garcinia Cambogia.”</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-13-TMZ-pre-sell-page.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-96784 size-full" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-13-TMZ-pre-sell-page.png" alt="" width="754" height="750" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-13-TMZ-pre-sell-page.png 754w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-13-TMZ-pre-sell-page-150x150.png 150w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-13-TMZ-pre-sell-page-300x298.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-13-TMZ-pre-sell-page-370x368.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Figure 13. TMZ pre-sell page</em></span></p>
<p>This was coupled with other screenshots Jovi provided for the sales pages that users were redirected to when clicking on any of the links.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 15. Garcinia Cambogia sales page variant 2</span></em></p>
<p>Again, having them lined up next to each other helps to illustrate the obvious template being used when building these sales page. All the way down to the “IN STOCK” warning banners across the top that can be seen on the most recent “PureFit Keto” site. It also shows that, for at least 4 years now, they’ve been creating the templates in parallel to the fake celebrity endorsement pre-sell sites.</p>
<p>After reviewing a few more articles I found regarding these campaigns, with the <a href="https://blog.threattrack.com/garcinia-cambogia-spam-a-timeline-and-new-outbreaks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earliest</a> dating back to mid-2013, I began to look at the actual sales page URLs and corresponding meta-data to see if anything stood out.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that in this chain of events, the “affiliates” are the individuals pushing the initial enticements, such as the e-mail spam. There is a demarcation that occurs in affiliate marketing at the point of the sales pages which appear to be run by the “merchants” who sell the products and provide the pre-sell pages for affiliates to use.</p>
<p>They, of course, can be one in the same person but I wanted to try and understand the other side of the fence since they are so entwined with the deceptive marketing side of the campaign.</p>
<p>Looking at the sites from the campaigns I was observing, both <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">“inteligen[.]org”</span> and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">“purefitketo[.]net”</span> didn’t provide anything of note; however, the site,<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"> “naturalgarciniacambogia[.]net”</span>, from Jovi’s blog over at MalwareBytes did.</p>
<p>Back on January 22 2016, about 6 days before removing their details, a WHOIS record revealed the name, e-mail, and organization which registered that particular domain.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-96787" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-16-WHOIS-for-naturalgarciniacambogia.net_.png" alt="" width="595" height="118" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-16-WHOIS-for-naturalgarciniacambogia.net_.png 595w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-16-WHOIS-for-naturalgarciniacambogia.net_-590x118.png 590w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-16-WHOIS-for-naturalgarciniacambogia.net_-300x59.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-16-WHOIS-for-naturalgarciniacambogia.net_-370x73.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></p>

<h3>JJR Media</h3>
<p>To kick things off, I did a quick Google search for the “JJR Media” organization and immediately found its website, with plenty of examples on display of their sales pages.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-17-JJR-media-website.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-96788 size-full" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-17-JJR-media-website.png" alt="" width="1071" height="718" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-17-JJR-media-website.png 1071w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-17-JJR-media-website-900x603.png 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-17-JJR-media-website-300x201.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-17-JJR-media-website-768x515.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-17-JJR-media-website-1024x686.png 1024w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-17-JJR-media-website-370x248.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 1071px) 100vw, 1071px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Figure 17. JJR media website</em></span></p>
<p>They have multiple products listed, all with similar templates, and even a slightly modernized version of their older Garcinia sales page.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-18-Updated-Garcinia-sales-page.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-96789" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-18-Updated-Garcinia-sales-page.png" alt="" width="705" height="438" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-18-Updated-Garcinia-sales-page.png 705w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-18-Updated-Garcinia-sales-page-300x186.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-18-Updated-Garcinia-sales-page-370x230.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Figure 18. Updated Garcinia sales page</em></span></p>
<p>Of course, two hits on Google below the one for their main website you find one for the <a href="https://www.bbb.org/us/fl/tallahassee/profile/health-and-medical-products/jjr-media-llc-0633-90085409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Better Business Bureau (BBB)</a> and complaints against the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">“naturalgarciniacambogia[.]net”</span> website. It provides more details on the actual business organization behind the web site, which I was surprised to find was incorporated. I’ve since learned that one of the driving factors that these affiliate marketers have in incorporating their businesses is so they, the individual, cannot be held personally liable when people start going after them for fraud and the like.</p>
<p>These websites are hosted alongside an affiliate marketing network for a business called “Express Revenue Inc.”, which, if you pivot further on the domains hosted by these organizations, you can see multiple sales pages like the ones discussed in this blog.</p>

<p>Focusing on the website <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">“cbdlifereview[.]com”</span>, which appears as though it is still being setup, it exposes an open directory of folders on the website.</p>

<p>Each of these “lp” (landing pages) are the exact same deceptive pre-sell pages as described above by the FTC.</p>

<h3>The FTC, Oprah, Dr. Oz, and NBC</h3>
<p>Affiliate marketing scams like this are not new. Back in 2009, Oprah and Dr. Oz filed a lawsuit against hundreds of affiliates using the same type of “pre-sell” deceptive celebrity endorsement pages, which made national headlines. By 2014, the FTC was dragged front and center because of these fraudulent campaigns. There were literally thousands of these sites and affiliates, but I think it’s clear that the work done back this has done little to curb this still rampant activity.</p>
<p>From the FTC’s <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/05/ftc-charges-green-coffee-bean-sellers-deceiving-consumers-through" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> on the event:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">“Not only did these defendants trick consumers with their phony weight loss claims, they also compounded the deception by advertising on pretend news sites, making it impossible for people to know whether they were seeing news or an ad,” said Jessica Rich, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.</span></p>
<p>As I was investigating all of these campaigns, I shared frequent screenshots and updates of interesting tidbits with the rest of my team. A funny thing happened a few months ago when one of them was watching the Today show on NBC, who is the current pre-sell flavor of the week, and they ran a segment on this exact campaign. My colleague sent me a link to the video and in turn, an <a href="https://www.today.com/news/liva-derma-posts-fake-free-trial-ad-featuring-savannah-guthrie-t146843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article they published</a> about it.</p>
<p>In this case, the sales page was trying to sell a skin care product called “Liva Derma Serum” and it was brought to the attention of the shows frontrunner by a fan asking if it was real, and subsequently investigated by Gadi Schwartz and Lindsey Bomnin.</p>
<p>Now, before we continue on with this exploration, the next term we need to learn is “re-bill” and how it’s abused in this industry as a mechanism to scam people. That’s effectively what all of these campaigns are and, based on reading discussions in affiliate marketing communities, it’s one of the bigger cash cows.</p>
<h3>Another Bill, Sir?</h3>
<p>After you’ve lured the victim to your website, in tiny fine print that will never be seen, you include a line that says “if you don’t cancel your subscription within X days then you’ll be billed an absorbent amount of money on a reoccurring basis until you cancel.” You entice them with free products, or a trial run, to get your hooks in and then after they cover the initial cost of shipping, you slap them with large charges directly to their credit cards which may go unseen for multiple billing cycles.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone notices before it’s too late but more often than not, at least one cycle goes through and the merchants laugh all the way to the bank. At some point in the past, seemingly all of the affiliate marketing scams basically switched to this scheme because the payouts are bigger and there may be some legal wiggle-room due to that fine print. Every campaign described in this blog is a re-bill scam. Heck, even the affiliates know it’s unscrupulous but, as “bprimeelite” so tastefully stated: “in this world you either have to be the wolf or the sheep”.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Figure 23. Re-bill scam acknowledgement</em></span></p>
<p>To recap then –</p>
<ol>
<li>You have affiliates who spam links to get people to the pre-sell/landing pages and get paid a small amount of money for every user who successfully submits a valid credit card.</li>
<li>You have “merchants” who run the re-bill scheme and potentially make $50-$100 per surprise credit card billing.</li>
<li>You have an affiliate network which connects the merchants to the affiliates and acts as an intermediary who gets a piece of the pie from the merchants.</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking at the Better Business Bureau’s (BBB) website provides a wealth of information on these affiliate networks and merchant businesses. It’s not uncommon to see warning like this for consumers:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">BBB files indicate that this business has a pattern of complaints concerning: business not refunding the costumer and continued billing without customers knowledge. On July 7, 2014, the BBB sent a request to the business to address this pattern and what actions the business has taken to help eliminate the causes of complaints.</span></p>
<p>These BBB complaints highlight the “re-bill” scam in full effect.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">01/13/2017</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">I signed up for a trial offer and they tried to charge my account $120 at two separate times. Notice this morning on January 13th 2017 that my account had been charged for $90 from this company. Then I proceeded to call the company and tell them that I had signed up for the trial that they had going on for $4.95.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">12/12/2016</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">This company operates with deceitful business practices. They offer you a &#8220;free&#8221; product. You only have to pay minimal shipping. The free product enrolls you in an auto refill system and if you do not cancel your membership (that you are unaware you have) within 14 days you are charged $89.99 a month for additional product. On top of the hassle of unwittingly being charged for it, THEIR PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK!!</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">09/13/2016</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">I thought this was free, only had to pay 4.94 for shipping. I feel I was mislead.They have charged my account 89.99 for one bottle.Their advertising I received email saying free products of your choosing, all you had to do was pay for shipping.</span></p>
<p>All of this is allowed by the following line in the terms of service on the sales pages after you click a tiny link towards the bottom of the page.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CONSUMER TRANSACTION INVOLVES A NEGATIVE OPTION AND THAT I MAY BE LIABLE FOR PAYMENT OF FUTURE GOODS AND SERVICES, UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, IF I FAIL TO NOTIFY THE Garcinia Active Slim NOT TO SUPPLY THE PRODUCTS DESCRIBED. BY PLACING MY ORDER, I PROVIDE MY ELECTRONIC AUTHORIZATION FOR FUTURE CHARGES AGAINST MY CREDIT CARD UNLESS I CANCEL. IN ADDITION, YOU DO NOT HOLD Garcinia Active Slim RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OVERDRAFT CHARGES OR FEES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR DURING THE ONGOING AUTO-SHIP PROGRAM.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Takedown Cures</span></h3>
<p>This brings us to the question of “what can be done about it?” and unfortunately, the reality is there isn’t much beyond education, which this blog attempts to provide to the reader.</p>
<p>The FTC is aware and the celebrities and organizations being used are aware with some having taken legal action, but it still remains as problematic as ever &#8211; so what else can be done?</p>
<p>Well, as part of this research and data collection, after identifying a reoccurring pattern of abuse of GoDaddy services, I reached out to their Threat Intelligence team to see if we couldn’t tackle at least one aspect of these campaigns and hinder the perpetuation of the scams.</p>
<p>After writing some new scripts to automate and collect shadow domains for these campaigns and working with GoDaddy’s abuse teams, we were able to successfully identify and shut down over 15,000 subdomain being used across these campaigns.</p>
<p>Based on what we know from the dozens of publicly available “bit.ly” and “goo.gl” statistics of the initial URLs being spammed out to our customers, we are able to glean a little insight into the potential disruption this shutdown may have. On average, primarily with viewers from the United States of America, the links were each clicked 273 times. If even a fraction of the 15,000 plus subdomains received that many clicks per site, then it removed millions of potential targets these actors could prey upon.</p>
<p>A big win for everyone involved that will go a long way in protecting consumers.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Throughout this blog, I’ve tried to stress the importance of patterns at every phase of analysis to establish the behaviors for how these affiliates, networks, and merchants operate. The Internet has proved to be a breeding ground for nefarious activity and with so many moving parts, it constantly makes attribution and accountability more complicated.</p>
<p>While pouring over the forums, both private and public, for these affiliate marketers, you find that they are all very aware of the fraud that is rampant in their industry. In a lot of cases, they are even openly flaunting their “black hat” activities. They know that due to the anonymous nature of the Internet, the difficulty that the U.S. Government has faced when trying to prosecute these crimes, and how easy it has become to blend into the every-day background noise, there appears to be little risk to them for continuing with these scams.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate to see how pervasive this advertising industry has become and it doesn’t appear to be slowing down anytime soon as long as the money keeps flowing in.</p>
<p>There are a lot of players in the affiliate marketing world, from the affiliates to the merchants and all of the networks in-between. Hopefully this blog helps to shine some light on how at every link in this chain there are shady, sometimes illegal, and almost always deceptive, business practices still being employed to scam hard working people out of their money.</p>
